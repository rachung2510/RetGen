doc	Cosmography with the Einstein Telescope EOS Einstein Telescope (ET) is a 3rd generation gravitational-wave (GW) detector that is currently undergoing a design study. EOS ET can detect millions of compact binary mergers up to redshifts 2-8. EOS A small fraction of mergers might be observed in coincidence as gamma-ray bursts, helping to measure both the luminosity distance and red-shift to the source.	By fitting these measured values to a cosmological model, it should be possible to accurately infer the dark energy equation-of-state, dark matter and dark energy density parameters.
doc	Exact simulation of diffusion first exit times: algorithm acceleration EOS In order to describe or estimate different quantities related to a specific random variable, it is of prime interest to numerically generate such a variate. EOS In specific situations, the exact generation of random variables might be either momentarily unavailable or too expensive in terms of computation time. EOS It therefore needs to be replaced by an approximation procedure. EOS As was previously the case, the ambitious exact simulation of exit times for diffusion processes was unreachable though it concerns many applications in different fields like mathematical finance, neuroscience or reliability. EOS The usual way to describe exit times was to use discretization schemes, that are of course approximation procedures. EOS Recently, Herrmann and Zucca REF proposed a new algorithm, the so-called GDET-algorithm (General Diffusion Exit Time), which permits to simulate exactly the exit time for one-dimensional diffusions. EOS The only drawback of exact simulation methods using an acceptance-rejection sampling is their time consumption.	In this paper the authors highlight an acceleration procedure for the GDET-algorithm based on a multi-armed bandit model.
doc	cosmoabc: Likelihood-free inference via Population Monte Carlo Approximate Bayesian Computation EOS Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) enables parameter inference for complex physical systems in cases where the true likelihood function is unknown, unavailable, or computationally too expensive. EOS It relies on the forward simulation of mock data and comparison between observed and synthetic catalogues. EOS Here we present cosmoabc, a Python ABC sampler featuring a Population Monte Carlo (PMC) variation of the original ABC algorithm, which uses an adaptive importance sampling scheme. EOS The code is very flexible and can be easily coupled to an external simulator, while allowing to incorporate arbitrary distance and prior functions.	As an example of practical application, we coupled cosmoabc with the numcosmo library and demonstrate how it can be used to estimate posterior probability distributions over cosmological parameters based on measurements of galaxy clusters number counts without computing the likelihood function.
doc	Best Viewpoints for External Robots or Sensors Assisting Other Robots EOS This work creates a model of the value of different external viewpoints of a robot performing tasks. EOS The current state of the practice is to use a teleoperated assistant robot to provide a view of a task being performed by a primary robot; EOS however, the choice of viewpoints is ad hoc and does not always lead to improved performance. EOS This research applies a psychomotor approach to develop a model of the relative quality of external viewpoints using Gibsonian affordances. EOS In this approach, viewpoints for the affordances are rated based on the psychomotor behavior of human operators and clustered into manifolds of viewpoints with the equivalent value. EOS The value of 30 viewpoints is quantified in a study with 31 expert robot operators for 4 affordances (Reachability, Passability, Manipulability, and Traversability) using a computer-based simulator of two robots. EOS The adjacent viewpoints with similar values are clustered into ranked manifolds using agglomerative hierarchical clustering. EOS The results show the validity of the affordance-based approach by confirming that there are manifolds of statistically significantly different viewpoint values, viewpoint values are statistically significantly dependent on the affordances, and viewpoint values are independent of a robot.	Furthermore, the best manifold for each affordance provides a statistically significant improvement with a large Cohen's d effect size (1.1-2.3) in performance (improving time by 14%-59% and reducing errors by 87%-100%) and improvement in performance variation over the worst manifold.
doc	Universal Counting of Black Hole Entropy by Strings on the Stretched Horizon EOS We show that the entropy of any black object in any dimension can be understood as the entropy of a highly excited string on the stretched horizon. EOS The string has a gravitationally renormalized tension due to the large redshift near the horizon. EOS The Hawking temperature is given by the Hagedorn temperature of the string.	As examples, we consider black holes with one (black p-branes) or two charges, Reissner-Nordstrom black holes and the BTZ black hole in addition to Schwarzschild black holes.
doc	General relativistic analogs of Poisson's equation and gravitational binding energy EOS Employing the quasi-Maxwell form of the Einstein field equations in the context of gravitoelectromagnetism, we introduce a general relativistic analog of Poisson's equation as a natural outcome of the corresponding spacetime decomposition formalism. EOS The active density introduced in this formalism, apart from the matter-energy density and pressure, includes a third component which is the gravitoelectromagnetic energy density. EOS This general relativistic analog of Poisson's equation is compared with another analog introduced by Ehlers et al in.	Introduction of the cosmological constant and its effect on the active mass, are also discussed for both exterior and interior static spacetimes.
doc	Global drag-induced instabilities in protoplanetary disks EOS We use the Fokker-Planck equation and model the dispersive dynamics of solid particles in annular protoplanetary disks whose gas component is more massive than the particle phase. EOS We model particle--gas interactions as hard sphere collisions, determine the functional form of diffusion coefficients, and show the existence of two global unstable modes in the particle phase. EOS These modes have spiral patterns with the azimuthal wavenumber _EQN_ and rotate slowly. EOS We show that in ring-shaped disks, the phase space density of solid particles increases linearly in time towards an accumulation point near the location of pressure maximum, while instabilities grow exponentially. EOS Therefore, planetesimals and planetary cores can be efficiently produced near the peaks of unstable density waves.	In this mechanism, particles migrating towards the accumulation point will not participate in the formation of planets, and should eventually form a debris ring like the main asteroid belt or classical Kuiper belt objects.
doc	Terahertz Waveguiding in Silicon-Core Fibers EOS We propose the use of a silicon-core optical fiber for terahertz (THz) waveguide applications. EOS Finite-difference time-domain simulations have been performed based on a cylindrical waveguide with a silicon core and silica cladding. EOS High-resistivity silicon has a flat dispersion over a 0.1 - 3 THz range, making it viable for propagation of tunable narrowband CW THz and possibly broadband picosecond pules of THz radiation.	Simulations show the propagation dynamics and the integrated intensity, from which transverse mode profiles and absorption lengths are extraced.
doc	Search for excited spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 leptons at linear colliders EOS We study the single production of excited spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 leptons in future high energy _EQN_ collisions. EOS We calculate the production cross section and decay widths of excited spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 leptons according to their effective currents. EOS We show that these possible new excited states can be probed up to the mass _EQN_ ~ _EQN_ depending on their couplings to leptons and gauge bosons.	We present the angular distributions of final state particles as a measure to discriminate between an excited spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 lepton signal.
doc	Energy dissipation in van der Waals two-dimensional devices EOS Understanding the physics underlying energy dissipation is necessary for the effective thermal management of devices based on two-dimensional (2D) materials and requires insights into the interplay between heat generation and diffusion in such materials. EOS We review the microscopic mechanisms that govern Joule heating and energy dissipation processes in 2D materials such as graphene, black phosphorus and semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides.	We discuss the processes through which non-equilibrium charge carriers, created either transiently through photoexcitation or at steady state by a large electric field, undergo energy relaxation with the lattice and the substrate We also discuss how these energy dissipation processes are affected by the device configuration (heterostructure, substrate material including hexagonal boron nitride, etc) as the use of different substrates, encapsulation, disorder, etc can introduce or remove scattering processes that change the energy relaxation pathways.
doc	The square root law and structure of finite rings EOS Let _EQN_ be a finite ring and define the hyperbola _EQN_. EOS Suppose that for a sequence of finite odd order rings of size tending to infinity, the following "square root law" bound holds with a constant _EQN_ for all non-trivial characters _EQN_ on _EQN_: \[ \left| \sum_ (x,y)\in H \chi(x,y)\right|\leq C\sqrt |H|. EOS \] Then, with a finite number of exceptions, those rings are fields. EOS For rings of even order we show that there are other infinite families given by Boolean rings and Boolean twists which satisfy this square-root law behavior. EOS We classify the extremal rings, those for which the left hand side of the expression above satisfies the worst possible estimate.	We also describe applications of our results to problems in graph theory and geometric combinatorics.
doc	Equation of State Effects on Gravitational Waves from Rotating Core Collapse EOS Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by axisymmetric rotating collapse, bounce, and early postbounce phases of a galactic core-collapse supernova will be detectable by current-generation gravitational wave observatories. EOS Since these GWs are emitted from the quadrupole-deformed nuclear-density core, they may encode information on the uncertain nuclear equation of state (EOS). EOS We examine the effects of the nuclear EOS on GWs from rotating core collapse and carry out 1824 axisymmetric general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations that cover a parameter space of 98 different rotation profiles and 18 different EOS. EOS We show that the bounce GW signal is largely independent of the EOS and sensitive primarily to the ratio of rotational to gravitational energy, and at high rotation rates, to the degree of differential rotation. EOS The GW frequency of postbounce core oscillations shows stronger EOS dependence that can be parameterized by the core's EOS-dependent dynamical frequency _EQN_. EOS We find that the ratio of the peak frequency to the dynamical frequency follows a universal trend that is obeyed by all EOS and rotation profiles and that indicates that the nature of the core oscillations changes when the rotation rate exceeds the dynamical frequency. EOS We find that differences in the treatments of low-density nonuniform nuclear matter, of the transition from nonuniform to uniform nuclear matter, and in the description of nuclear matter up to around twice saturation density can mildly affect the GW signal.	We find that approximations and uncertainties in electron capture rates can lead to variations in the GW signal that are of comparable magnitude to those due to different nuclear EOS.

doc	Influence of Initialization on the Performance of Metaheuristic Optimizers EOS All metaheuristic optimization algorithms require some initialization, and the initialization for such optimizers is usually carried out randomly. EOS However, initialization can have some significant influence on the performance of such algorithms. EOS This paper presents a systematic comparison of 22 different initialization methods on the convergence and accuracy of five optimizers: differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), cuckoo search (CS), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). EOS We have used 19 different test functions with different properties and modalities to compare the possible effects of initialization, population sizes and the numbers of iterations. EOS Rigorous statistical ranking tests indicate that 43.37\% of the functions using the DE algorithm show significant differences for different initialization methods, while 73.68\% of the functions using both PSO and CS algorithms are significantly affected by different initialization methods. EOS The simulations show that DE is less sensitive to initialization, while both PSO and CS are more sensitive to initialization. EOS In addition, under the condition of the same maximum number of function evaluations (FEs), the population size can also have a strong effect. EOS Particle swarm optimization usually requires a larger population, while the cuckoo search needs only a small population size. EOS Differential evolution depends more heavily on the number of iterations, a relatively small population with more iterations can lead to better results. EOS Furthermore, ABC is more sensitive to initialization, while such initialization has little effect on GA.	Some probability distributions such as the beta distribution, exponential distribution and Rayleigh distribution can usually lead to better performance.
doc	Global Existence of Solution for a Nonlinear Size-structured Population Model with Distributed Delay in the Recruitment EOS In this paper we study a nonlinear size-structured population model with distributed delay in the recruitment.	The delayed problem is reduced into an abstract initial value problem of an ordinary differential equation in the Banach space by using the delay semigroup techniques.
doc	Birth rates of SGRs and AXPs: delayed amplification of magnetic field EOS We present new determination of the birth rate of AXPs and SGRS and their associated SNRs. EOS We find a high birth rate of 1/(500 yr) for AXPs/SGRs and 1/(1700 yr) for associated SNRs. EOS These high rates suggest that all massive stars (greater than ~ 25 M_sun) give rise to remnants with magnetar-like fields. EOS Recent observations indicate that fossil fields cannot explain such high fields in the progenitor stars. EOS Dynamo mechanisms during the birth of the neutron stars require spin rates much faster than either observations or theory indicate. EOS Here, we propose the neutron stars form with normal (~ 10^ 12 G) magnetic fields, which are then amplified to 10^ 14 -10^ 15 G after a delay of a few hundred years.	The amplification is speculated to be a consequence of color ferromagnetism and occurs after the neutron star core reaches quark-deconfinement density.
doc	Quantum metamaterials: Electromagnetic waves in a Josephson qubit line EOS We consider the propagation of a classical electromagnetic wave through a transmission line, formed by identical superconducting charge qubits inside a superconducting resonator.	Since the qubits can be in a coherent superposition of quantum states, we show that such a system demonstrates interesting new effects, such as a ``breathing'' photonic crystal with an oscillating bandgap, and a ``quantum Archimedean screw'' that transports, at an arbitrary controlled velocity, Josephson plasma waves through the transmission line.
doc	Similarity solutions of Fokker-Planck equation with time-dependent coefficients and fixed/moving boundaries EOS We consider the solvability of the Fokker-Planck equation with both time-dependent drift and diffusion coefficients by means of the similarity method. EOS By the introduction of the similarity variable, the Fokker-Planck equation is reduced to an ordinary differential equation.	Adopting the natural requirement that the probability current density vanishes at the boundary, the resulting ordinary differential equation turns out to be integrable, and the probability density function can be given in closed form.
doc	Phenomenology with fluctuating quantum geometries in loop quantum cosmology EOS The goal of this paper is to probe phenomenological implications of large fluctuations of quantum geometry in the Planck era, using cosmology of the early universe. EOS For the background (Friedmann, Lema\^ i tre, Robertson, Walker) ph quantum geometry, we allow `widely spread' states in which the ph relative dispersions are as large as _EQN_ in the Planck regime. EOS By introducing suitable methods to overcome the ensuing conceptual and computational issues, we calculate the power spectrum _EQN_ and the spectral index _EQN_ of primordial curvature perturbations. EOS These results generalize the previous work in loop quantum cosmology which focused on those states which were known to remain sharply peaked throughout the Planck regime.	Surprisingly, even though the fluctuations we now consider are large, their presence does not add new features to the final _EQN_ and _EQN_: Within observational error bars, their effect is degenerate with a different freedom in the theory, namely the number of ph pre-inflationary e-folds _EQN_ between the bounce and the onset of inflation.
doc	Multi-objective Bandits: Optimizing the Generalized Gini Index EOS We study the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem where the agent receives a vectorial feedback that encodes many possibly competing objectives to be optimized. EOS The goal of the agent is to find a policy, which can optimize these objectives simultaneously in a fair way. EOS This multi-objective online optimization problem is formalized by using the Generalized Gini Index (GGI) aggregation function.	We propose an online gradient descent algorithm which exploits the convexity of the GGI aggregation function, and controls the exploration in a careful way achieving a distribution-free regret _EQN_ with high probability.
doc	Graph Convolutional Network-based Suspicious Communication Pair Estimation for Industrial Control Systems EOS Whitelisting is considered an effective security monitoring method for networks used in industrial control systems, where the whitelists consist of observed tuples of the IP address of the server, the TCP/UDP port number, and IP address of the client (communication triplets). EOS However, this method causes frequent false detections. EOS To reduce false positives due to a simple whitelist-based judgment, we propose a new framework for scoring communications to judge whether the communications not present in whitelists are normal or anomalous. EOS To solve this problem, we developed a graph convolutional network-based suspicious communication pair estimation using relational graph convolution networks, and evaluated its performance. EOS For this, we collected the network traffic of three factories owned by Panasonic Corporation, Japan.	The proposed method achieved a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.957, which outperforms baseline approaches such as DistMult, a method that directly optimizes the node embeddings, and heuristics, which score the triplets using first- and second-order proximities of multigraphs.
doc	Phase Structure of Lattice QCD for General Number of Flavors EOS We investigate the phase structure of lattice QCD for general number of flavors _EQN_. EOS Based on numerical results combined with the result of the perturbation theory we propose the following picture: When _EQN_, there is only a trivial fixed point and therefore the theory in the continuum limit is trivial.	On the other hand, when _EQN_, there is a non-trivial fixed point and therefore the theory is non-trivial with anomalous dimensions, however, without quark confinement.
doc	Spin-induced black hole spontaneous scalarization EOS We study scalar fields in a black hole background and show that, when the scalar is suitably coupled to curvature, rapid rotation can induce a tachyonic instability. EOS This instability, which is the hallmark of spontaneous scalarization in the linearized regime, is expected to be quenched by nonlinearities and endow the black hole with scalar hair.	Hence, our results demonstrate the existence of a broad class of theories that share the same stationary black hole solutions with general relativity at low spins, but which exhibit black hole hair at sufficiently high spins (_EQN_).
doc	Glueballs from the Bethe-Salpeter equation EOS We formulate a framework to determine the mass of glueball states of Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory in the continuum. EOS To this end we derive a Bethe-Salpeter equation for two gluon bound states including the effects of Faddeev-Popov ghosts. EOS We construct a suitable approximation scheme such that the interactions in the bound state equation match a corresponding successful approximation of the Dyson-Schwinger equations for the Landau gauge ghost and gluon propagators.	Based upon a recently obtained solution for the propagators in the complex momentum plane we obtain results for the mass of the scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs.
doc	Off-axis reference beam for full-field swept-source OCT and holoscopy EOS In numerous applications, Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) suffers from a limited imaging depth due to signal roll-off, a limited focal range, and autocorrelation noise. EOS Here, we propose a parallel full-field FD-OCT imaging method that uses a swept laser source and an area camera in combination with an off-axis reference, which is incident on the camera at a small angle. EOS As in digital off-axis holography, this angle separates autocorrelation signals and the complex conjugated mirror image from the actual signal in Fourier space. EOS We demonstrate that by reconstructing the signal term only, this approach enables full-range imaging, i.e., it increases the imaging depth by a factor of two, and removes autocorrelation artifacts. EOS The previously demonstrated techniques of inverse scattering and holoscopy can then numerically extend the focal range without loss of lateral resolution or imaging sensitivity.	The resulting, significantly enhanced measurement depth is demonstrated by imaging a porcine eye over its entire depth, including cornea, lens, and retina.
doc	Distributed Multi-Depot Routing without Communications EOS We consider and formulate a class of distributed multi-depot routing problems, where servers are to visit a set of requests, with the aim of minimizing the total distance travelled by all servers. EOS These problems fall into two categories: distributed offline routing problems where all the requests that need to be visited are known from the start; EOS distributed online routing problems where the requests come to be known incrementally. EOS A critical and novel feature of our formulations is that communications are not allowed among the servers, hence posing an interesting and challenging question: what performance can be achieved in comparison to the best possible solution obtained from an omniscience planner with perfect communication capabilities? EOS The worst-case (over all possible request-set instances) performance metrics are given by the approximation ratio (offline case) and the competitive ratio (online case). EOS Our first result indicates that the online and offline problems are effectively equivalent: for the same request-set instance, the approximation ratio and the competitive ratio differ by at most an additive factor of 2, irrespective of the release dates in the online case. EOS Therefore, we can restrict our attention to the offline problem. EOS For the offline problem, we show that the approximation ratio given by the Voronoi partition is m (the number of servers).	For two classes of depot configurations, when the depots form a line and when the ratios between the distances of pairs of depots are upper bounded by a sublinear function f(m) (i.e., f(m) = o(m)), we give partition schemes with sublinear approximation ratios O(log m) and \Theta (f(m)) respectively.
doc	On the uniqueness for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation with a strong angular singularity EOS We prove an inequality on the Wasserstein distance with quadratic cost between two solutions of the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation without angular cutoff, from which we deduce some uniqueness results. EOS In particular, we obtain a local (in time) well-posedness result in the case of (possibly very) soft potentials. EOS A global well-posedeness result is shown for all regularized hard and soft potentials without angular cutoff. EOS Our uniqueness result seems to be the first one applying to a strong angular singularity, except in the special case of Maxwell molecules.	Our proof relies on the ideas of Tanaka: we give a probabilistic interpretation of the Boltzmann equation in terms of a stochastic process.
doc	Spiky Strings and Spin Chains EOS We determine spectral curves for the known spiky string solutions in AdS space in the limit of large angular momentum. EOS We also construct generic multi-spike solutions in this limit and compute the corresponding spectral data.	The resulting spectral curves precisely match those of the classical spin chain describing the dual operators in one-loop gauge theory.
doc	Effects of Magnetic Fields on Proto-Neutron Star Winds EOS We discuss effects of magnetic fields on proto-neutron star winds by performing numerical simulation.	We assume that the atmosphere of proto-neutron star has a homogenous magnetic field (ranging from ~10^ 12 G to ~10^ 15 G) perpendicular to the radial direction and examine the dependence of the three key quantities (dynamical time scale, electron fraction, and entropy per baryon) for the successful r-process on the magnetic field strength.
doc	Universal algebraic relaxation of fronts propagating into an unstable state EOS We analyze ``pulled'' or ``linearly marginally stable'' fronts propagating into unstable states. EOS While ``pushed'' fronts into meta- and unstable states relax exponentially, pulled fronts relax algebraically, and simultaneously the standard derivation of effective interface equations breaks down. EOS We calculate all universal relaxation terms of uniformly translating pulled fronts.	The leading _EQN_ and _EQN_ corrections to the velocity are determined by the dispersion relation of the linearized equation only.

doc	Dipole-phonon quantum logic with trapped polar molecular ions EOS The interaction between the electric dipole moment of a trapped molecular ion and the configuration of the confined Coulomb crystal couples the orientation of the molecule to its motion. EOS We consider the practical feasibility of harnessing this interaction to initialize, process, and read out quantum information encoded in molecular ion qubits without optically illuminating the molecules.	We present two schemes wherein a molecular ion can be entangled with a co-trapped atomic ion qubit, providing, among other things, a means for molecular state preparation and measurement.
doc	Long-range Heisenberg models in quasi-periodically driven crystals of trapped ions EOS We introduce a theoretical scheme for the analog quantum simulation of long-range XYZ models using current trapped-ion technology. EOS In order to achieve fully-tunable Heisenberg-type interactions, our proposal requires a state-dependent dipole force along a single vibrational axis, together with a combination of standard resonant and detuned carrier drivings.	We discuss how this quantum simulator could explore the effect of long-range interactions on the phase diagram by combining an adiabatic protocol with the quasi-periodic drivings and test the validity of our scheme numerically.
doc	Updated Electroweak Measurements from Neutrino-Nucleon Deeply Inelastic Scattering at CCFR EOS We report the results of a study of electroweak parameters from observations of neutral-current _EQN_ N deeply inelastic scattering in the CCFR detector at the FNAL Tevatron Quadrupole Triplet neutrino beam. EOS An improved extraction of the weak mixing angle in the on-shell renormalization scheme, incorporating additional data and with an improved technique for constraining systematic errors, is presented. EOS Within the Standard Model, this result constrains the W mass with a precision comparable to that from direct measurements. EOS The result is also presented in a model-independent form, as constraints on neutral-current quark-neutrino couplings, to facilitate comparisons with theories outside the Standard Model.	Using this result, limits on new four-fermion interactions, leptoquarks and neutrino oscillations are presented.
doc	A Random Finite Set Model for Data Clustering EOS The goal of data clustering is to partition data points into groups to minimize a given objective function. EOS While most existing clustering algorithms treat each data point as vector, in many applications each datum is not a vector but a point pattern or a set of points. EOS Moreover, many existing clustering methods require the user to specify the number of clusters, which is not available in advance. EOS This paper proposes a new class of models for data clustering that addresses set-valued data as well as unknown number of clusters, using a Dirichlet Process mixture of Poisson random finite sets.	We also develop an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo posterior inference technique that can learn the number of clusters and mixture parameters automatically from the data.
doc	Universal temperature dependence of electron number in one-dimensional Hubbard model EOS We investigate the temperature region in which a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) description of the charge sector of the one-dimensional Hubbard model is valid. EOS By using the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz method, electron number is calculated at finite temperatures and fixed chemical potential. EOS We observe maximum electron number as a function of temperature close to the chemical potential of the upper critical value that corresponds to half filling. EOS As the chemical potential approaches the upper critical value from below, the temperature _EQN_ at which the electron number shows its maximum asymptotically approaches a universal relation.	We show that, below the energy corresponding to _EQN_, the charge excitation spectrum nearly obeys a linear dispersion relation.
doc	Expensive control of long-time averages using sum of squares and its application to a laminar wake flow EOS The paper presents a nonlinear state-feedback control design approach for long-time average cost control, where the control effort is assumed to be expensive. EOS The approach is based on sum-of-squares and semi-definite programming techniques. EOS It is applicable to dynamical systems whose right-hand side is a polynomial function in the state variables and the controls. EOS The key idea, first described but not implemented in (Chernyshenko et al, Phil. EOS Trans. EOS R. EOS Soc. EOS A, 372, 2014), is that the difficult problem of optimizing a cost function involving long-time averages is replaced by an optimization of the upper bound of the same average. EOS As such, controller design requires the simultaneous optimization of both the control law and a tunable function, similar to a Lyapunov function. EOS The present paper introduces a method resolving the well-known inherent non-convexity of this kind of optimization. EOS The method is based on the formal assumption that the control is expensive, from which it follows that the optimal control is small. EOS The resulting asymptotic optimization problems are convex. EOS The derivation of all the polynomial coefficients in the controller is given in terms of the solvability conditions of state-dependent linear and bilinear inequalities.	The proposed approach is applied to the problem of designing a full-information feedback controller that mitigates vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder in the laminar regime via rotary oscillations.
doc	Characterizing quark gluon plasma by dilepton interferometry EOS The Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) radii have been calculated from the two particle correlation functions with virtual photons produced in the collisions of two nuclei at ultra-relativistic energies.	We show that the variation of the HBT radii with the invariant mass of the virtual photon can be used to characterize and distinguish the hadronic as well as the partonic phase that might have produced initially in the collisions.

The usual five continuous symmetries (and their conserved Noether charges) and two discrete symmetries together provide the physical realizations of the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry.
doc	Solving the mu problem with a heavy Higgs boson EOS We discuss the generation of the mu-term in a class of supersymmetric models characterized by a low energy effective superpotential containing a term lambda S H_1 H_2 with a large coupling lambda~2. EOS These models generically predict a lightest Higgs boson well above the LEP limit of 114 GeV and have been shown to be compatible with the unification of gauge couplings. EOS Here we discuss a specific example where the superpotential has no dimensionful parameters and we point out the relation between the generated mu-term and the mass of the lightest Higgs boson. EOS We discuss the fine-tuning of the model and we find that the generation of a phenomenologically viable mu-term fits very well with a heavy lightest Higgs boson and a low degree of fine-tuning.	We discuss experimental constraints from collider direct searches, precision data, thermal relic dark matter abundance, and WIMP searches finding that the most natural region of the parameter space is still allowed by current experiments.
doc	Minimum-Distance Based Construction of Multi-Kernel Polar Codes EOS In this paper, we propose a construction for multi-kernel polar codes based on the maximization of the minimum distance. EOS Compared to the original construction based on density evolution, our new design shows particular advantages for short code lengths, where the polarization effect has less impact on the performance than the distances of the code.	We introduce and compute the minimum-distance profile and provide a simple greedy algorithm for the code design.

doc	Heterogeneous Optoelectronic Characteristics of Si Micropillar Arrays Fabricated by Metal-Assisted Chemical Etching EOS Recent progress achieved in metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) has enabled the production of high-quality micropillar arrays for various optoelectronic applications. EOS Si micropillars produced by MACE often show a porous Si/SiOx shell on crystalline pillar cores introduced by local electrochemical reactions. EOS In this paper, we report the distinct optoelectronic characteristics of the porous Si/SiOx shell correlated to their chemical compositions. EOS Local photoluminescent (PL) images obtained with an immersion oil objective lens in confocal microscopy show a red emission peak (about 650 nm) along the perimeter of the pillars that is threefold stronger compared to their center. EOS On the basis of our analysis, we find an unexpected PL increase (about 540 nm) at the oil/shell interface. EOS We suggest that both PL enhancements are mainly attributed to the porous structures, a similar behavior observed in previous MACE studies.	Surface potential maps simultaneously recorded with topography reveal a significantly high surface potential on the sidewalls of MACE-synthesized pillars (+0.5 V), which is restored to the level of planar Si control (-0.5 V) after removing SiOx in hydrofluoric acid.
doc	Scalar neutrino dark matter in _EQN_ SSM EOS _EQN_ SSM is the extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM) and its local gauge group is _EQN_. EOS To obtain this model, three singlet new Higgs superfields and right-handed neutrinos are added to MSSM. EOS In the framework of _EQN_ SSM, we study the Higgs mass and take the lightest CP-even sneutrino as a cold dark matter candidate.	For the lightest CP-even sneutrino, the relic density and the cross section for dark matter scattering off nucleon are both researched.
doc	Horizon Thermodynamics from Einstein's Equation of State EOS By regarding the Einstein equations as equation(s) of state, we demonstrate that a full cohomogeneity horizon first law can be derived in horizon thermodynamics.	In this approach both the entropy and the free energy are derived concepts, while the standard (degenerate) horizon first law is recovered by a Legendre projection from the more general one we derive.

EOS For these compactifications a warp factor for the metric has to be taken into account.	This warp factor is non-trivial in three space-time dimensions due to Chern-Simons corrections to the fivebrane Bianchi identity.
doc	Open Strings On The Rindler Horizon EOS It has been proposed that a certain Z_N orbifold, analytically continued in N, can be used to describe the thermodynamics of Rindler space in string theory. EOS In this paper, we attempt to implement this idea for the open-string sector.	The most interesting result is that, although the orbifold is tachyonic for positive integer N, the tachyon seems to disappear after analytic continuation to the region that is appropriate for computing _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the density matrix of Rindler space and Re _EQN_ >1.
doc	On finite groups acting on homology 4-spheres and finite subgroups of SO(5)	We show that a finite group which admits a faithful, smooth, orientation-preserving action on a homology 4-sphere, and in particular on the 4-sphere, is isomorphic to a subgroup of the orthogonal group SO(5), by explicitly determining the various groups which can occur (up to an indetermination of index two in the case of solvable groups).
doc	Neutron stars with Bogoliubov quark-meson coupling model EOS A quark-meson coupling model based on the quark model proposed by Bogoliubov for the description of the quark dynamics is developed and applied to the description of neutron stars. EOS Starting from a su(3) symmetry approach, it is shown that this symmetry has to be broken in order to satisfy the constraints set by the hypernuclei and by neutron stars.	The model is able to describe observations such as two solar mass stars or the radius of canonical neutron stars within the uncertainties presently accepted.
doc	Deflection of Highly Relativistic Particles in a Gravitational Field EOS A novel approach to the calculation of the deflection of highly relativistic test particles in gravitational fields is described. EOS We make use of the light-like boosts of the gravitational fields of the sources.	Examples are given of the deflection of highly relativistic particles in the Schwarzschild and Kerr gravitational fields, in the field of a static, axially symmetric, multipole source and in the field of a cosmic string.
doc	Twisted local systems solve the (holographic) loop equation of large-N QCD_4 EOS We construct a holographic map from the loop equation of large-N QCD in d=2 and d=4, for planar self-avoiding loops, to the critical equation of an equivalent effective action. EOS The holographic map is based on two ingredients: an already proposed holographic form of the loop equation, such that the quantum contribution is reduced to a regularized residue;	a new conformal map from the region encircled by the based loop to a cuspidal fundamental domain in the upper half-plane, such that the regularized residue vanishes at the cusp.
doc	The thermal conductivity reduction in HgTe/CdTe superlattices	The techniques used previously to calculate the three-fold thermal conductivity reduction due to phonon dispersion in GaAs/AlAs superlattices (SLs) are applied to HgTe/CdTe SLs.
doc	Photo and acoustic emissions from the non-equilibrium phase transition at the interface during cavitation EOS This study investigates the emission of light and sound from cavitation caused by intense pressure pulses in water.	Based on time-resolved measurements of (a) pressure waveform at the focus, (b) light scattering upon cavitation, (c) acoustic emission, and (d) photoemission (sonoluminescence) it is shown that emissions occur upon the creation or expansion as well as the collapse of the cavity.
doc	Beyond substitutions: the spectral theory of regular sequences EOS Regular sequences are natural generalisations of fixed points of constant-length substitutions on finite alphabets, that is, of automatic sequences. EOS Indeed, a regular sequence that takes only finitely many values is automatic.	Given a _EQN_ -regular sequence _EQN_, there is an associated vector space _EQN_, which is analogous to the substitution dynamical system induced by a given substitution.
doc	Quasiclassical approach to synergic synchrotron-Cherenkov radiation in polarized vacuum EOS The photon emission by an ultrarelativistic charged particle in extremely strong magnetic field is analyzed, with vacuum polarization and photon recoil taken into account. EOS The vacuum polarization is treated phenomenologically via refractive index. EOS The photon emission occurs in the synergic (cooperative) synchrotron-Cherenkov process [J. EOS Schwinger, W. EOS Tsai and T. EOS Erber, Annals of Physics, 96 303 (1976)] which is similar to the synchrotron emission rather than to the Cherenkov one. EOS For electrons, the effect of the vacuum polarization on the emission spectrum is not evident even beyond the probable onset of non-perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED).	However, the effect of the vacuum polarization on the emission spectrum can be observable for muons already at _EQN_, with _EQN_ the muon Lorentz factor, _EQN_ the magnetic field strength and _EQN_ the critical QED field.
doc	On the coarse classification of tight contact structures	We present a sketch of the proof of the following theorems: (1) Every 3-manifold has only finitely many homotopy classes of 2-plane fields which carry tight contact structures.
doc	Ginzburg-Landau theory for the time-dependent phase field in a two-dimensional d-wave superconductor EOS We derive a finite temperature time-dependent effective theory for the phase _EQN_ of the pairing field, which is appropriate for a 2D conducting electron system with non-retarded d-wave attraction.	As for s-wave pairing the effective action contains terms with Landau damping, but their structure appears to be different from the s-wave case due to the fact that the Landau damping is determined by the quasiparticle group velocity _EQN_, which for the d-wave pairing does not have the same direction as the non-interacting Fermi velocity _EQN_.
doc	Nonparametric gamma kernel estimators of density derivatives on positive semiaxis EOS We consider nonparametric estimation of the derivative of a probability density function with the bounded support on _EQN_. EOS Estimates are looked up in the class of estimates with asymmetric gamma kernel functions. EOS The use of gamma kernels is due to the fact they are nonnegative, change their shape depending on the position on the semi-axis and possess other good properties.	We found analytical expressions for bias, variance, mean integrated squared error (MISE) of the derivative estimate.
doc	Dressed Relaxation and Dephasing in a Strongly Driven Two-Level system EOS We study relaxation and dephasing in a strongly driven two-level system interacting with its environment. EOS We develop a theory which gives a straightforward physical picture of the complex dynamics of the system in terms of dressed states. EOS In addition to the dressing of the energy diagram, we describe the dressing of relaxation and dephasing.	We find a good quantitative agreement between the theoretical calculations and measurements of a superconducting qubit driven by an intense microwave field.
doc	Dark Matter and the CACTUS Gamma-Ray Excess from Draco EOS The CACTUS atmospheric Cherenkov telescope collaboration recently reported a gamma-ray excess from the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. EOS Draco features a very low gas content and a large mass-to-light ratio, suggesting as a possible explanation annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) in the Draco dark-matter halo. EOS We show that with improved angular resolution, future measurements can determine whether the halo is cored or cuspy, as well as its scale radius. EOS We find the relevant WIMP masses and annihilation cross sections and show that supersymmetric models can account for the required gamma-ray flux. EOS The annihilation cross section range is found to be not compatible with a standard thermal relic dark-matter production.	We compute for these supersymmetric models the resulting Draco gamma-ray flux in the GLAST energy range and the rates for direct neutralino detection and for the flux of neutrinos from neutralino annihilation in the Sun.
doc	Knot complements, hidden symmetries and reflection orbifolds EOS In this article we examine the conjecture of Neumann and Reid that the only hyperbolic knots in the _EQN_ -sphere which admit hidden symmetries are the figure-eight knot and the two dodecahedral knots. EOS Knots whose complements cover hyperbolic reflection orbifolds admit hidden symmetries, and we verify the Neumann-Reid conjecture for knots which cover small hyperbolic reflection orbifolds.	We also show that a reflection orbifold covered by the complement of an AP knot is necessarily small.

doc	Nonconvex Nonsmooth Low-Rank Minimization via Iteratively Reweighted Nuclear Norm EOS The nuclear norm is widely used as a convex surrogate of the rank function in compressive sensing for low rank matrix recovery with its applications in image recovery and signal processing. EOS However, solving the nuclear norm based relaxed convex problem usually leads to a suboptimal solution of the original rank minimization problem. EOS In this paper, we propose to perform a family of nonconvex surrogates of _EQN_ -norm on the singular values of a matrix to approximate the rank function. EOS This leads to a nonconvex nonsmooth minimization problem. EOS Then we propose to solve the problem by Iteratively Reweighted Nuclear Norm (IRNN) algorithm. EOS IRNN iteratively solves a Weighted Singular Value Thresholding (WSVT) problem, which has a closed form solution due to the special properties of the nonconvex surrogate functions. EOS We also extend IRNN to solve the nonconvex problem with two or more blocks of variables.	In theory, we prove that IRNN decreases the objective function value monotonically, and any limit point is a stationary point.
doc	On the magnitudes of compact sets in Euclidean spaces EOS The notion of the magnitude of a metric space was introduced by Leinster in  and developed in,,  and, but the magnitudes of familiar sets in Euclidean space are only understood in relatively few cases. EOS In this paper we study the magnitudes of compact sets in Euclidean spaces. EOS We first describe the asymptotics of the magnitude of such sets in both the small and large-scale regimes. EOS We then consider the magnitudes of compact convex sets with nonempty interior in Euclidean spaces of odd dimension, and relate them to the boundary behaviour of solutions to certain naturally associated higher order elliptic boundary value problems in exterior domains. EOS We carry out calculations leading to an algorithm for explicit evaluation of the magnitudes of balls, and this establishes the convex magnitude conjecture of Leinster and Willerton  in the special case of balls in dimension three.	In general we show that the magnitude of an odd-dimensional ball is a rational function of its radius.
doc	A sharp-front moving boundary model for malignant invasion EOS We analyse a novel mathematical model of malignant invasion which takes the form of a two-phase moving boundary problem describing the invasion of a population of malignant cells into a population of background tissue, such as skin. EOS Cells in both populations undergo diffusive migration and logistic proliferation. EOS The interface between the two populations moves according to a two-phase Stefan condition. EOS Unlike many reaction-diffusion models of malignant invasion, the moving boundary model explicitly describes the motion of the sharp front between the cancer and surrounding tissues without needing to introduce degenerate nonlinear diffusion. EOS Numerical simulations suggest the model gives rise to very interesting travelling wave solutions that move with speed _EQN_, and the model supports both malignant invasion and malignant retreat, where the travelling wave can move in either the positive or negative _EQN_ -directions. EOS Unlike the well-studied Fisher-Kolmogorov and Porous-Fisher models where travelling waves move with a minimum wave speed _EQN_, the moving boundary model leads to travelling wave solutions with _EQN_.	We interpret these travelling wave solutions in the phase plane and show that they are associated with several features of the classical Fisher-Kolmogorov phase plane that are often disregarded as being nonphysical.
doc	Possible magnetic field variability during the 6.7 GHz methanol maser flares of G09.62+0.20 EOS (Abridged) Recently, the magnetic field induced Zeeman splitting was measured for the strongest known 6.7 GHz methanol maser, which arises in the massive star forming region G09.62+0.20. EOS This maser is one of a handful of periodically flaring methanol masers. EOS The 100-m Effelsberg telescope was used to monitor the 6.7 GHz methanol masers of G09.62+0.20. EOS With the exception of a two week period during the peak of the maser flare, we measure a constant magnetic field of B_||~11+-2 mG in the two strongest maser components of G09.62+0.20 that are separated by over 200 AU. EOS In the two week period that coincides exactly with the peak of the maser flare of the strongest maser feature, we measure a sharp decrease and possible reversal of the Zeeman splitting.	The exact cause of both maser and polarization variability is still unclear, but it could be related to either background amplification of polarized emission or the presence of a massive protostar with a close-by companion.
doc	Dirac neutrino mass from a neutrino dark matter model for the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 EOS The dark matter in the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 is modelled as an isothermal sphere of neutrinos. EOS New data on the _EQN_ mass density allow an accurate description of its core and halo. EOS The model has no "missing baryon problem" and beyond _EQN_ Mpc the baryons have the cosmic mass abundance. EOS Combination of cluster data with the cosmic dark matter fraction -- here supposed to stem from the neutrinos -- leads to a solution of the dark matter riddle by left and right handed neutrinos with mass 1.847 +/- 0.016 eV.	The thus far observed absence of neutrinoless double beta decay points to (quasi-) Dirac neutrinos: uncharged electrons with different flavour and mass eigenbasis, as for quarks.
doc	The Volumetric Rate of Superluminous Supernovae at z~1 EOS We present a measurement of the volumetric rate of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) at z~1, measured using archival data from the first four years of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). EOS We develop a method for the photometric classification of SLSNe to construct our sample. EOS Our sample includes two previously spectroscopically-identified objects, and a further new candidate selected using our classification technique. EOS We use the point-source recovery efficiencies from Perrett et.al. EOS (2010) and a Monte Carlo approach to calculate the rate based on our SLSN sample. EOS We find that the three identified SLSNe from SNLS give a rate of 91 (+76/-36) SNe/Yr/Gpc^3 at a volume-weighted redshift of z=1.13. EOS This is equivalent to 2.2 (+1.8/-0.9) x10^-4 of the volumetric core collapse supernova rate at the same redshift. EOS When combined with other rate measurements from the literature, we show that the rate of SLSNe increases with redshift in a manner consistent with that of the cosmic star formation history.	We also estimate the rate of ultra-long gamma ray bursts (ULGRBs) based on the events discovered by the Swift satellite, and show that it is comparable to the rate of SLSNe, providing further evidence of a possible connection between these two classes of events.
doc	Characterisation of homotopy ribbon discs EOS Let _EQN_ be either the infinite cyclic group _EQN_ or the Baumslag-Solitar group _EQN_. EOS Let _EQN_ be a slice knot admitting a slice disc _EQN_ in the 4-ball whose exterior has fundamental group _EQN_. EOS We classify the _EQN_ -homotopy ribbon slice discs for _EQN_ up to topological ambient isotopy rel. EOS boundary.	In the infinite cyclic case, there is a unique equivalence class of such slice discs.
doc	Gumbel-softmax-based Optimization: A Simple General Framework for Optimization Problems on Graphs EOS In computer science, there exist a large number of optimization problems defined on graphs, that is to find a best node state configuration or a network structure such that the designed objective function is optimized under some constraints. EOS However, these problems are notorious for their hardness to solve because most of them are NP-hard or NP-complete. EOS Although traditional general methods such as simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithms (GA) and so forth have been devised to these hard problems, their accuracy and time consumption are not satisfying in practice. EOS In this work, we proposed a simple, fast, and general algorithm framework based on advanced automatic differentiation technique empowered by deep learning frameworks. EOS By introducing Gumbel-softmax technique, we can optimize the objective function directly by gradient descent algorithm regardless of the discrete nature of variables. EOS We also introduce evolution strategy to parallel version of our algorithm.	We test our algorithm on three representative optimization problems on graph including modularity optimization from network science, Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model from statistical physics, maximum independent set (MIS) and minimum vertex cover (MVC) problem from combinatorial optimization on graph.
doc	Chiral Charged Fermions, One Dimensional Quantum Field Theory and Vertex Algebra EOS We give an explicit _EQN_ -representation of chiral charged fermions using the Hardy-Lebesgue octant decomposition. EOS In the " pure" case such a representation was already used by M. EOS Sato in holonomic field theory. EOS We study both "pure" and " mixed" cases.	In the compact case we rigorously define unsmeared chiral charged fermion operators inside the unit circle.
doc	Slow continued fractions and permutative representations of _EQN_ EOS Representations of the Cuntz algebra _EQN_ are constructed from interval dynamical systems associated with slow continued fraction algorithms introduced by Giovanni Panti.	Their irreducible decomposition formulas are characterized by using the modular group action on real numbers, as a generalization of results by Kawamura, Hayashi and Lascu.
doc	Relaxation operator for quasiparticles in a solid EOS Popular models of the phenomenological relaxation operators that are widely used in the master equation formalism for open condensed-matter systems have significant flaws ranging from limited applicability to violation of fundamental physical principles. EOS We propose a relatively simple universal model of the relaxation operator which is free from these flaws, has a correct static limit, correct direct-current limit in a uniform electric field, includes both interband and intraband transitions, and is valid for an arbitrary dispersion of quasiparticles in a solid.	We use the proposed operator to generalize the Lindhard formula and derive explicit expressions for the relaxation operator for Dirac materials with an unconventional energy spectrum of quasiparticles, such as graphene and Weyl semimetals.

doc	A simplified expression for the one-loop soft-gluon current with massive fermions	We present a much simpler analytic expression for the UV un-renormalized one-loop soft-gluon current which controls the infra-red behavior of one-loop QCD amplitudes with massive fermions when an external gluon becomes soft.
doc	Difficulties applying recent blind source separation techniques to EEG and MEG EOS High temporal resolution measurements of human brain activity can be performed by recording the electric potentials on the scalp surface (electroencephalography, EEG), or by recording the magnetic fields near the surface of the head (magnetoencephalography, MEG). EOS The analysis of the data is problematic due to the fact that multiple neural generators may be simultaneously active and the potentials and magnetic fields from these sources are superimposed on the detectors. EOS It is highly desirable to un-mix the data into signals representing the behaviors of the original individual generators. EOS This general problem is called blind source separation and several recent techniques utilizing maximum entropy, minimum mutual information, and maximum likelihood estimation have been applied. EOS These techniques have had much success in separating signals such as natural sounds or speech, but appear to be ineffective when applied to EEG or MEG signals.	Many of these techniques implicitly assume that the source distributions have a large kurtosis, whereas an analysis of EEG/MEG signals reveals that the distributions are multimodal.
doc	Influence of Waviness on the Elastic Properties of Aligned Carbon Nanotube Polymer Matrix Nanocomposites EOS The promise of enhanced performance has motivated the study of one dimensional nanomaterials, especially aligned carbon nanotubes (A-CNTs), for the reinforcement of polymeric materials. EOS While early work has shown that CNTs have remarkable theoretical properties, more recent work on aligned CNT polymer matrix nanocomposites (A-PNCs) have reported mechanical properties that are orders of magnitude lower than those predicted by rule of mixtures. EOS This large difference primarily originates from the morphology of the CNTs that reinforce the A-PNCs, which have significant local curvature commonly referred to as waviness, but are commonly modeled using the oversimplified straight column geometry.	Here we used a simulation framework capable of analyzing 10 _EQN_ wavy CNTs with realistic stochastic morphologies to study the influence of waviness on the compliance contribution of wavy A-CNTs to the effective elastic modulus of A-PNCs, and show that waviness is responsible for the orders of magnitude \textit over-prediction of the A-PNC effective modulus by existing theoretical frameworks that both neglect the shear deformation mechanism and do not properly account for the CNT morphpology.
doc	Spectral and temporal properties of RX J0520.5-6932 (LXP 8.04) during a type-I outburst EOS We observed RX J0520.5-6932 in the X-rays and studied the optical light curve of its counterpart to verify it as a Be/X-ray binary. EOS We performed an XMM-Newton anticipated target of opportunity observation in January 2013 during an X-ray outburst of the source in order to search for pulsations and derive its spectral properties. EOS We monitored the source with Swift to follow the evolution of the outburst and to look for further outbursts to verify the regular pattern seen in the optical light curve with a period of ~24.4 d. EOS The XMM-Newton EPIC light curves show coherent X-ray pulsations with a period of 8.035331(15) s (1 sigma). EOS The X-ray spectrum can be modelled by an absorbed power law with photon index of ~0.8, an additional black-body component with temperature of ~0.25 keV and an Fe K line. EOS Phase-resolved X-ray spectroscopy reveals that the spectrum varies with pulse phase. EOS We confirm the identification of the optical counterpart within the error circle of XMM-Newton at an angular distance of ~0.8 arcsec, which is an O9Ve star with known Halpha emission.	By analyzing the combined data from three OGLE phases we derived an optical period of 24.43 d.The X-ray pulsations and long-term variability, as well as the properties of the optical counterpart, confirm that RX J0520.5-6932 is a Be/X-ray binary pulsar in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
doc	The Origin of the X-ray Emission from the High-velocity Cloud MS30.7-81.4-118 EOS A soft X-ray enhancement has recently been reported toward the high-velocity cloud MS30.7-81.4-118 (MS30.7), a constituent of the Magellanic Stream. EOS In order to investigate the origin of this enhancement, we have analyzed two overlapping XMM-Newton observations of this cloud. EOS We find that the X-ray enhancement is _EQN_ 6' or _EQN_ 100 pc across, and is concentrated to the north and west of the densest part of the cloud. EOS We modeled the X-ray enhancement with a variety of spectral models. EOS A single-temperature equilibrium plasma model yields a temperature of _EQN_ K and a 0.4-2.0 keV luminosity of _EQN_ erg s _EQN_. EOS However, this model underpredicts the on-enhancement emission around 1 keV, which may indicate the additional presence of hotter plasma (_EQN_ K), or that recombination emission is important. EOS We examined several different physical models for the origin of the X-ray enhancement. EOS We find that turbulent mixing of cold cloud material with hot ambient material, compression or shock heating of a hot ambient medium, and charge exchange reactions between cloud atoms and ions in a hot ambient medium all lead to emission that is too faint. EOS In addition, shock heating in a cool or warm medium leads to emission that is too soft (for reasonable cloud speeds).	We find that magnetic reconnection could plausibly power the observed X-ray emission, but resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations are needed to test this hypothesis.
doc	Statistics of excitons in quantum dots and the resulting microcavity emission spectra EOS A theoretical investigation is presented of the statistics of excitons in quantum dots (QDs) of different sizes.	A formalism is developed to build the exciton creation operator in a dot from the single exciton wavefunction and it is shown how this operator evolves from purely fermionic, in case of a small QD, to purely bosonic, in case of large QDs.
doc	On Schr\"odinger superalgebras EOS We construct, using the supersymplectic framework of Berezin, Kostant and others, two types of supersymmetric extensions of the Schr\"odinger algebra (itself a conformal extension of the Galilei algebra). EOS An ` _EQN_ -type' extension exists in any space dimension, and for any pair of integers _EQN_ and _EQN_.	It yields an _EQN_ superalgebra, which generalizes the N=1 supersymmetry Gauntlett et al found for a free spin- _EQN_ particle, as well as the N=2 supersymmetry of the fermionic oscillator found by Beckers et al In two space dimensions, new, `exotic' or ` _EQN_ -type' extensions arise for each pair of integers _EQN_ and _EQN_, yielding an _EQN_ superalgebra of the type discovered recently by Leblanc et al in non relativistic Chern-Simons theory.
doc	Direct observation of the coherent nuclear response after the absorption of a photon EOS How molecules convert light energy to perform a specific transformation is a fundamental question in photophysics. EOS Ultrafast spectroscopy reveals the kinetics associated with electronic energy flow, but little is known about how absorbed photon energy drives nuclear or electronic motion.	Here, we used ultrabroadband transient absorption spectroscopy to monitor coherent vibrational energy flow after photoexcitation of the retinal chromophore.
doc	Asymmetry of Strange Sea in Nucleons EOS Based on the finite-temperature field theory, we evaluate the medium effects in nucleon which can induce an asymmetry between quarks and antiquarks of the strange sea.	The short-distance effects determined by the weak interaction can give rise to _EQN_ where _EQN_ is the medium-induced mass of strange quark by a few KeV at most, but the long-distance effects by strong interaction are sizable.
doc	From Graph Isoperimetric Inequality to Network Connectivity -- A New Approach EOS We present a new, novel approach to obtaining a network's connectivity. EOS More specifically, we show that there exists a relationship between a network's graph isoperimetric properties and its conditional connectivity. EOS A network's connectivity is the minimum number of nodes, whose removal will cause the network disconnected. EOS It is a basic and important measure for the network's reliability, hence its overall robustness. EOS Several conditional connectivities have been proposed in the past for the purpose of accurately reflecting various realistic network situations, with extra connectivity being one such conditional connectivity.	In this paper, we will use isoperimetric properties of the hypercube network to obtain its extra connectivity.

doc	Hall-magnetohydrodynamic waves in flowing ideal incompressible solar-wind plasmas: Reconsidered EOS It is well established that the magnetically structured solar atmosphere supports the propagation of MHD waves along various kind of jets including also the solar wind. EOS It is well-known as well that under some conditions, namely high enough jet speeds, the propagating MHD modes can become unstable against to the most common Kelvin--Helmholtz instability (KHI). EOS In this article, we explore how the propagation and instability characteristics of running along a slow solar wind MHD modes are affected when they are investigated in the framework of the ideal Hall-magnetohydrodynamics. EOS Hall-MHD is applicable if the jet width is shorter than or comparable to the so called Hall parameter _EQN_ (where _EQN_ is the speed of light and _EQN_ is the ion plasma frequency). EOS We model the solar wind as a moving with velocity _EQN_ cylindrical flux tube of radius _EQN_, containing incompressible plasma with density _EQN_ permeated by a constant magnetic field _EQN_. EOS The surrounding plasma is characterized with its density _EQN_ and magnetic field _EQN_.	The dispersion relation of MHD waves is derived in the framework of both standard and Hall-MHD and is numerically solved with input parameters: the density contrast _EQN_, the magnetic fields ratio _EQN_, and the Hall scale parameter _EQN_.
doc	Dynamic Walking over Rough Terrains by Nonlinear Predictive Control of the Floating-base Inverted Pendulum EOS We present a real-time pattern generator for dynamic walking over rough terrains. EOS Our method automatically finds step durations, a critical issue over rough terrains where they depend on terrain topology. EOS To achieve this level of generality, we consider a Floating-base Inverted Pendulum (FIP) model where the center of mass can translate freely and the zero-tilting moment point is allowed to leave the contact surface. EOS This model is equivalent to a linear inverted pendulum with variable center-of-mass height, but its equations of motion remain linear. EOS Our solution then follows three steps: (i) we characterize the FIP contact-stability condition; EOS (ii) we compute feedforward controls by solving a nonlinear optimization over receding-horizon FIP trajectories. EOS Despite running at 30 Hz in a model-predictive fashion, simulations show that the latter is too slow to stabilize dynamic motions.	To remedy this, we (iii) linearize FIP feedback control into a constrained linear-quadratic regulator that runs at 300 Hz.
doc	Universal Gysin formulas for the universal Hall-Littlewood functions EOS It is known that the usual Schur _EQN_ - and _EQN_ -polynomials can be described via the Gysin homomorphisms for flag bundles in the ordinary cohomology theory. EOS Recently, P. EOS Pragacz generalized these Gysin formulas to the Hall-Littlewood polynomials.	In this paper, we introduce a universal analogue of the Hall-Littlewood polynomials, which we call the universal Hall-Littlewood functions, and give Gysin formulas for various flag bundles in the complex cobordism theory.
doc	Properties of Baryons Containing a Heavy Quark in the Skyrme Model EOS The properties of baryons containing one heavy quark are studied in the Skyrme model, where they are treated as bound states of a heavy meson with an _EQN_ chiral soliton. EOS In the large _EQN_ limit, the baryon spectrum is an infinite tower of degenerate states with isospin and spin of the light degrees of freedom _EQN_, and total spin _EQN_. EOS Exotic states with no quark model analogues in the large _EQN_ limit are found to be unbound. EOS The _EQN_ mass difference is computed and found to be in good agreement with experiment.	The _EQN_ and _EQN_ coupling constants are calculated to leading order in _EQN_ in terms of _EQN_, the axial coupling constant of the nucleon.

A surface whose mean curvature vector field is lightlike is said to be quasi-minimal.
doc	Unified nonclassicality criteria EOS In this work we generalize the Bochner criterion addressing the characteristic function, i.e., the Fourier transform, of the Glauber-Sudarshan phase-space function. EOS For this purpose we extend the Bochner theorem by including derivatives of the characteristic function. EOS The resulting necessary and sufficient nonclassicality criteria unify previously known moment-based criteria with those based on the characteristic function. EOS For applications of the generalized nonclassicality probes, we provide direct sampling formulas for balanced homodyne detection.	A squeezed vacuum state is experimentally realized and characterized with our method.
doc	Quantum impurity in a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid: continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo approach EOS We develop a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) method for quantum impurities coupled to interacting quantum wires described by a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. EOS The method is negative-sign free for any values of the Tomonaga-Luttinger parameter, which is rigorously proved, and thus, efficient low-temperature calculations are possible. EOS Duality between electrons and bosons in one dimensional systems allows us to construct a simple formula for the CTQMC algorithm in these systems. EOS We show that the CTQMC for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids can be implemented with only minor modifications of previous CTQMC codes developed for impurities coupled to non-interacting fermions.	We apply this method to the Kane-Fisher model of a potential scatterer in a spin-less quantum wire and to a single spin coupled with the edge state of a two-dimensional topological insulator assuming an anisotropic XXZ coupling.
doc	Parity violation in the CMB trispectrum from the scalar sector EOS Under the existence of chiral non-Gaussian sources during inflation, the trispectrum of primordial curvature perturbations can break parity. EOS We examine signatures of the induced trispectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. EOS It is confirmed via a harmonic-space analysis that, as a consequence of parity violation, such a CMB trispectrum has nonvanishing signal in the _EQN_ domain, which is prohibited in the concordance cosmology. EOS When the curvature trispectrum is parametrized with Legendre polynomials, the CMB signal due to the Legendre dipolar term is enhanced at the squeezed configurations in _EQN_ space, yielding a high signal-to-noise ratio. EOS A Fisher matrix computation results in a minimum detectable size of the dipolar coefficient in a cosmic-variance-limited-level temperature survey as _EQN_. EOS In an inflationary model where the inflaton field couples to the gauge field via an _EQN_ interaction, the curvature trispectrum contains such a parity-odd dipolar term.	We find that, in this model, the CMB trispectrum yields a high signal-to-noise ratio compared with the CMB power spectrum or bispectrum.
doc	DeepRT: deep learning for peptide retention time prediction in proteomics EOS Accurate predictions of peptide retention times (RT) in liquid chromatography have many applications in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. EOS Herein, we present DeepRT, a deep learning based software for peptide retention time prediction. EOS DeepRT automatically learns features directly from the peptide sequences using the deep convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, which eliminates the need to use hand-crafted features or rules.	After the feature learning, principal component analysis (PCA) was used for dimensionality reduction, then three conventional machine learning methods were utilized to perform modeling.
doc	From learning gait signatures of many individuals to reconstructing gait dynamics of one single individual EOS Based on the same databases, we computationally address two seemingly highly related, in fact drastically distinct, questions via computational data-driven algorithms: 1) how to precisely achieve the big task of differentiating gait signatures of many individuals? EOS 2) how to reconstruct an individual's complex gait dynamics in full? EOS Our brains can "effortlessly" resolve the first question, but will definitely fail in the second one. EOS Since many fine temporal scale gait patterns surely escape our eyes. EOS Based on accelerometers' 3D gait time series databases, we link the answers toward both questions via multiscale structural dependency within gait dynamics of our musculoskeletal system. EOS Two types of dependency manifestations are explored. EOS We first develop simple algorithmic computing called Principle System-State Analysis (PSSA) for the coarse dependency in implicit forms. EOS PSSA is shown to be able to efficiently classifying among many subjects. EOS We then develop a multiscale Local-1st-Global-2nd (L1G2) Coding Algorithm and a landmark computing algorithm. EOS With both algorithms, we can precisely dissect rhythmic gait cycles, and then decompose each cycle into a series of cyclic gait phases.	With proper color-coding and stacking, we reconstruct and represent an individual's gait dynamics via a 3D cylinder to collectively reveal universal deterministic and stochastic structural patterns on centisecond (10 milliseconds) scale across all rhythmic cycles.
doc	A counterexample to the simple loop conjecture for PSL(2,R) EOS In this note, we give an explicit counterexample to the simple loop conjecture for representations of surface groups into PSL(2,R).	Specifically, we show that for any surface with negative Euler characteristic and genus at least 1, there are uncountably many non-conjugate, non-injective homomorphisms of its fundamental group into PSL(2,R) that kill no simple closed curve (nor any power of a simple closed curve).

doc	Cyclotomic structure in the topological Hochschild homology of _EQN_ EOS Let _EQN_ be a finite CW complex, and let _EQN_ be its dual in the category of spectra.	We demonstrate that the Poincar\'e/Koszul duality between _EQN_ and the free loop space _EQN_ is in fact a genuinely _EQN_ -equivariant duality that preserves the _EQN_ -fixed points.
doc	Weak-Interacting Holographic QCD EOS We propose a simple prescription for including low-energy weak-interactions into the framework of holographic QCD, based on the standard AdS/CFT dictionary of double-trace deformations. EOS As our proposal enables us to calculate various electro-weak observables involving strongly coupled QCD, it opens a new perspective on phenomenological applications of holographic QCD. EOS We illustrate efficiency and usefulness of our method by performing a few exemplar calculations;	neutron beta decay, charged pion weak decay, and meson-nucleon parity non-conserving (PNC) couplings.

doc	Dynamics and Topology of Flexible Chains: Knots in Steady Shear Flows EOS We use numerical simulations of a bead-spring model chain to investigate the evolution of the conformation of long and flexible elastic fibers in a steady shear flow. EOS In particular, for rather open initial configurations, and by varying a dimensionless elastic parameter, we identify two distinct conformational modes with different final size, shape, and orientation. EOS Through further analysis we identify slipknots in the chain.	Finally, we provide examples of initial configurations of an "open" trefoil knot that the flow unknots and then knots again, sometimes repeating several times.

doc	Realistic _EQN_ model with a type II Dirac neutrino seesaw mechanism EOS Here we propose a realistic _EQN_ electroweak gauge model with enlarged Higgs sector.	The scheme allows for the natural implementation of a type II seesaw mechanism for Dirac neutrinos, while charged lepton and quark masses are reproduced in a natural way thanks to the presence of new scalars.
doc	Can _EQN_ help us extract |V_ ub |? EOS We study radiative corrections to _EQN_ decays assuming the power counting _EQN_ for the charm-quark mass. EOS Concentrating on the shape-function region, we use effective field-theory methods to calculate the hadronic tensor at NLO accuracy.	From this we deduce a shape-function independent relation between partially integrated _EQN_ and _EQN_ spectra to leading power in _EQN_, including first-order corrections in the strong coupling constant.
doc	Intrinsic spin requires gravity with torsion and curvature EOS We show that the intrinsic angular momentum of matter in curved spacetime requires the metric-affine formulation of gravity, in which the antisymmetric part of the affine connection (the torsion tensor) is not constrained to be zero but is a variable in the principle of stationary action. EOS Regarding the tetrad and spin connection (or the metric and torsion tensors) as independent variables gives the correct generalization of the conservation law for the total (orbital plus intrinsic) angular momentum to the presence of the gravitational field.	The metric-affine formulation extends general relativity to the simplest theory of gravity with intrinsic spin: the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble theory.
doc	Real-time Exciton-Manipulation of Plexcitonic Coupling in a WS2-Ag nanocavity EOS We demonstrate the real-time exciton-manipulation of plexcitonic coupling in monolayer WS2 coupled to a plasmonic nanocavity by immersing into a mixed solution of dichloromethane (DCM) and ethanol. EOS By adjusting the mixture ratio, a continuous tuning of the Rabi splitting energy ranged from 178 meV (in ethanol) to 266 meV (in DCM) is achieved.	The results are mainly attributed to the remarkable increase of the proportion of neutral exciton in the monolayer WS2 (from 59% to 100%) as the concentration of DCM is increased.
doc	High Order Disturbance Rejection and Tracking via Delayed Feedback Control Method EOS Delayed feedback control is an easy realizable control method which generates control force by comparing the current and the delayed version of the system states. EOS In this paper, a new form of the delayed feedback structure is introduced. EOS Based on the proposed delayed feedback method, a new robust tracking system is designed. EOS This tracking system improves the features of the conventional state feedback with integral action and it is also able to reject higher order disturbances compared to the conventional method. EOS In addition, the proposed tracking system tracks the ramp-shape reference input signal as well, which this is not possible through the conventional state feedback. EOS Due to easy implementable feature of the proposed delayed feedback tracking system, it can be used in practical applications effectively. EOS Moreover, since the proposed method adds delays to the closed loop system dynamics, the ordinary differential equation of the system changes to a delay differential equation with an infinite number of characteristic roots. EOS Thus, conventional pole placement procedures cannot be used to design the delayed feedback controller parameters and place the unstable roots in the left half plane.	In this paper, the simulated annealing algorithm is used to determine the proposed control system parameters and move the unstable roots of the delay differential equation to the left half plane.
doc	Transport in Transitory Dynamical Systems EOS We introduce the concept of a "transitory" dynamical system---one whose time-dependence is confined to a compact interval---and show how to quantify transport between two-dimensional Lagrangian coherent structures for the Hamiltonian case. EOS This requires knowing only the "action" of relevant heteroclinic orbits at the intersection of invariant manifolds of "forward" and "backward" hyperbolic orbits. EOS These manifolds can be easily computed by leveraging the autonomous nature of the vector fields on either side of the time-dependent transition.	As illustrative examples we consider a two-dimensional fluid flow in a rotating double-gyre configuration and a simple one-and-a-half degree of freedom model of a resonant particle accelerator.
doc	Finite Sample Complexity of Sequential Monte Carlo Estimators EOS We present bounds for the finite sample error of sequential Monte Carlo samplers on static spaces. EOS Our approach explicitly relates the performance of the algorithm to properties of the chosen sequence of distributions and mixing properties of the associated Markov kernels. EOS This allows us to give the first finite sample comparison to other Monte Carlo schemes.	We obtain bounds for the complexity of sequential Monte Carlo approximations for a variety of target distributions including finite spaces, product measures, and log-concave distributions including Bayesian logistic regression.
doc	Origin of a large CP asymmetry in B+- --> K+ K- K+ decays EOS Large _EQN_ -violating asymmetry effects in the B+- --> K+ K- K decays have been predicted in the QCD factorization model. EOS The model includes strong K+ K- final-state long-distance interactions in the S-, P-, and also (in the recent analysis) D- wave two-body states. EOS The S-wave two-body unitarity conditions involve interchannel couplings of the kaon-kaon states with the intermediate states of two pions and four pions. EOS As a result, the pion-pion to kaon-kaon rescattering effects are included in the model.	It is shown how the weak phase differences together with the existence of two different strong phases of the S-wave decay amplitudes (related to the phases of the kaon scalar strange and non-strange form factors) contribute to the CP-asymmetry in question.
doc	Constraints on Higher Dimensional Models for viable Extended Inflation EOS We consider two kinds of higher dimensional models which upon dimensional reduction lead to Jordan-Brans-Dicke type effective actions in four dimensions with the scale factor of the extra dimensions playing the role of the JBD field. EOS These models are characterized by the potential for the JBD field which arises from the process of dimensional reduction, and by the coupling of the inflaton sector with the JBD field in the Jordan frame. EOS Taking into account the fact that these models allow the possibility of enough inflation and dynamical compactification of the extra dimensions, we examine in the context of these models the other conditions which need to be satisfied for a viable scenario of extended inflation.	We find that the requirements of conforming to general relativity at the present epoch, and producing suitable bubble spectrums during inflation lead to constraints on the allowed values taken by the parameters of these models.

doc	Covariant action for bouncing cosmologies in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity EOS Cyclic universes with bouncing solutions are candidates for solving the big bang initial singularity problem. EOS Here we seek bouncing solutions in a modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory, of the type _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the Ricci scalar, _EQN_ is the Gauss-Bonnet term, and _EQN_ some function of it. EOS In finding such a bouncing solution we resort to a technique that reduces the order of the differential equations of the _EQN_ theory to second order equations.	As general relativity is a theory whose equations are of second order, this order reduction technique enables one to find solutions which are perturbatively close to general relativity.
doc	Two-layer Residual Sparsifying Transform Learning for Image Reconstruction EOS Signal models based on sparsity, low-rank and other properties have been exploited for image reconstruction from limited and corrupted data in medical imaging and other computational imaging applications. EOS In particular, sparsifying transform models have shown promise in various applications, and offer numerous advantages such as efficiencies in sparse coding and learning. EOS This work investigates pre-learning a two-layer extension of the transform model for image reconstruction, wherein the transform domain or filtering residuals of the image are further sparsified in the second layer.	The proposed block coordinate descent optimization algorithms involve highly efficient updates.
doc	On the shadowing and limit shadowing properties EOS We study the relation between the shadowing property and the limit shadowing property.	We prove that if a continuous self-map _EQN_ of a compact metric space has the limit shadowing property, then the restriction of _EQN_ to the non-wandering set satisfies the shadowing property.

doc	Photometry and Spectroscopy of Old, Outer Disk Star Clusters: vdB-Hagen 176, Berkeley 29 and Saurer 1 EOS It has been previously proposed that some distant open clusters in the Milky Way may have been accreted during a dwarf galaxy merger, perhaps associated with the same event that led to the formation of the Galactic anticenter stellar structure (GASS), also known as the ``Monoceros Ring''. EOS We have obtained VI and Washington+DDO51 photometric and medium resolution (R ~ 8000) multi-fiber spectroscopic data for the three distant old open clusters Berkeley 29, Saurer 1, and vdB-Hagen 176 (BH 176). EOS These clusters are spatially coincident with GASS, but radial velocities and spectroscopic metallicities had not been available during previous studies of the GASS candidate cluster system. EOS Similar data for the clusters Berkeley 20 and Berkeley 39 have been obtained for calibration purposes. EOS We provide the first reliable radial velocity for BH 176 (V_ helio = 11.2 +/- 5.3 km/s). EOS We also find that V_ helio = +95.4 +/- 3.6 and +28.4 +/- 3.6 km/s, for Saurer 1(A) and Berkeley 29, respectively. EOS We show that alpha-enhanced isochrones, while spectroscopically motivated, provide a poor fit to Be29 in contrast to previous findings. EOS We find that the clusters Berkeley 29 and Saurer 1 are consistent with the previously reported characteristics for GASS candidate clustersand the GASS stellar stream as derived from M-giant observations.	However, the radial velocity and photometric metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ 0.0 dex) for BH 176 suggests that a connection of this cluster with the putative GASS cluster system is unlikely.
doc	The mass loss process in dwarf galaxies from 3D hydrodynamical simulations: the role of dark matter and starbursts EOS Theoretical _EQN_ CDM cosmological models predict a much larger number of low mass dark matter haloes than has been observed in the Local Group of galaxies. EOS One possible explanation is the increased difficulty of detecting these haloes if most of the visible matter is lost at early evolutionary phases through galactic winds. EOS In this work we study the current models of triggering galactic winds in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) from supernovae, and study, based on 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations, the correlation of the mass loss rates and important physical parameters as the dark matter halo mass and its radial profile, and the star formation rate. EOS We find that the existence of winds is ubiquitous, independent on the gravitational potential. EOS Our simulations revealed that the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) may play a major role on pushing matter out of these systems, even for very massive haloes. EOS The instability is responsible for 5 - 40% of the mass loss during the early evolution of the galaxy, being less relevant at _EQN_ Myrs. EOS There is no significant difference in the mass loss rates obtained for the different dark matter profiles studied (NFW and logarithmic). EOS We have also found a correlation between the mass loss rate and both the halo mass and the rate of supernovae, as already reported in previous works.	Besides, the epoch in which most of the baryon galactic matter is removed from the galaxy varies depending on the SN rate and gravitational potential.
doc	Spontaneous and externally driven quantum spin fluctuations of 3d and 4d single atoms adsorbed on graphene EOS At the heart of current information nanotechnology lies the search for ideal platforms hosting the smallest possible magnets, i.e. EOS single atoms with magnetic moments pointing out-of-plane, as requested in a binary-type of memory. EOS For this purpose, a 2D material such as graphene would be an ideal substrate thanks to its intrinsic low electron and phonon densities, as well as its 6-fold symmetry. EOS Here we investigate, from first-principles, a fundamental mechanism detrimental for the magnetic stability: the zero-point spin-fluctuations modifying the effective energy landscape perceived by the local spin moments of 3 _EQN_ and 4 _EQN_ transition metal atoms deposited on a free standing graphene. EOS Utilizing time-dependent density functional theory and by virtue of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, these spontaneous quantum fluctuations are found to be negligible for most of the 3 _EQN_ elements, in strong contrast to the 4 _EQN_ atoms. EOS Surprisingly, we find that such fluctuations can promote the magnetic stability by switching the easy direction of the magnetic moment of Tc from being initially in-plane to out-of-plane.	The adatom-graphene complex gives rise to impurity states settling in some cases the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy --- the quantity that defines the energy barrier protecting the magnetic moments and, consequently, the spin-excitation behavior detectable with inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy.
doc	Instanton effects in ABJM theory with general R-charge assignments EOS We study the large N expansion of the partition function of the quiver superconformal Chern-Simons theories deformed by two continuous parameters which correspond to the general R-charge assignment to the matter fields. EOS Though the deformation breaks the conformal symmetry, we find that the partition function shares various structures with the superconformal cases, such as the Airy function expression of the perturbative expansion in 1/N with the overall constant A(k) related to the constant map in the ABJM case through a simple rescaling of k. EOS We also identify five kinds of the non-perturbative effects in 1/N which correspond to the membrane instantons.	The instanton exponents and the singular structure of the coefficients depend on the continuous deformation parameters, in contrast to the superconformal case where all the parameters are integers associated with the orbifold action on the moduli space.
doc	An experimentally accessible quality factor for Majorana wires EOS Spin-orbit coupled semiconducting nanowires with proximity-induced superconductivity are expected to host Majorana zero modes at their endpoints when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied. EOS The resulting phase would be a one-dimensional topological superconductor. EOS However, while a variety of experiments have been performed observing a zero bias conductance peak (suggestive of Majorana zero modes), the topological nature of these physical systems is still a subject of debate. EOS Here we suggest a quantitative test of the degree to which a system displaying a zero bias peak may be considered topological.	The experiment is similar to previous measurements of conductance, but is performed with the aid of a quantum dot at the wire's end.
doc	The Origins of the Circumgalactic Medium in the FIRE Simulations EOS We use a particle tracking analysis to study the origins of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), separating it into (1) accretion from the intergalactic medium (IGM), (2) wind from the central galaxy, and (3) gas ejected from other galaxies. EOS Our sample consists of 21 FIRE-2 simulations, spanning the halo mass range log(Mh/Msun) ~ 10-12, and we focus on z=0.25 and z=2. EOS Owing to strong stellar feedback, only ~L* halos retain a baryon mass >~50% of their cosmic budget. EOS Metals are more efficiently retained by halos, with a retention fraction >~50%. EOS Across all masses and redshifts analyzed >~60% of the CGM mass originates as IGM accretion (some of which is associated with infalling halos). EOS Overall, the second most important contribution is wind from the central galaxy, though gas ejected or stripped from satellites can contribute a comparable mass in ~L* halos. EOS Gas can persist in the CGM for billions of years, resulting in well-mixed halo gas. EOS Sight lines through the CGM are therefore likely to intersect gas of multiple origins. EOS For low-redshift ~L* halos, cool gas (T<10^4.7 K) is distributed on average preferentially along the galaxy plane, however with strong halo-to-halo variability.	The metallicity of IGM accretion is systematically lower than the metallicity of winds (typically by >~1 dex), although CGM and IGM metallicities depend significantly on the treatment of subgrid metal diffusion.
doc	The effect of Auger heating on intraband carrier relaxation in semiconductor quantumrods EOS The rate at which excited charge carriers relax to their equilibrium state affects many aspects of the performance of nanoscale devices, including switching speed, carrier mobility and luminescent efficiency. EOS Better understanding of the processes that govern carrier relaxation therefore has important technological implications. EOS A significant increase in carrier-carrier interactions caused by strong spatial confinement of electronic excitations in semiconductor nanostructures leads to a considerable enhancement of Auger effects, which can further result in unusual, Auger-process-controlled recombination and energy-relaxation regimes. EOS Here, we report the first experimental observation of efficient Auger heating in CdSe quantum rods at high pump intensities, leading to a strong reduction of carrier cooling rates.	In this regime, the carrier temperature is determined by the balance between energy outflow through phonon emission and energy inflow because of Auger heating.

doc	_EQN_ pairs from a nuclear transition signaling an elusive light neutral boson EOS Electron-positron pairs have been observed in the 10.95-MeV _EQN_ decay in _EQN_ O. EOS The branching ratio of the e _EQN_ e _EQN_ pairs compared to the 3.84-MeV _EQN_ _EQN_ decay of the level is deduced to be _EQN_. EOS This magnetic monopole (M0) transition cannot proceed by _EQN_ -ray decay and is, to first order, forbidden for internal pair creation. EOS However, the transition may also proceed by the emission of a light neutral _EQN_ or _EQN_ boson.	Indeed, we do observe a sharp peak in the _EQN_ angular correlation with all the characteristics belonging to the intermediate emission of such a boson with an invariant mass of 8.5(5) MeV/c _EQN_.

doc	1:1 alkali-TCNQ salts and the bond order wave (BOW) phase of half-filled linear Hubbard-type models EOS The bond order wave (BOW) phase of half-filled linear Hubbard-type models is narrow and difficult to characterize aside from a few ground state properties. EOS The BOW phase of a frustrated Heisenberg spin chain is wide and tractable. EOS It has broken inversion symmetry C_i in a regular array and finite gap E_m to the lowest triplet state. EOS The spin-BOW is exact in finite systems at a special point. EOS Its elementary excitations are spin-1/2 solitons that connect BOWs with opposite phase. EOS The same patterns of spin densities and bond orders appear in the BOW phase of Hubbard-type models. EOS Infrared (IR) active lattice phonons or molecular vibrations are derivatives of P, the polarization along the stack. EOS Molecular vibrations that are forbidden in regular arrays become IR active when C_i symmetry is broken.	1:1 alkali-TCNQ salts contain half-filled regular TCNQ- stacks at high temperature, down to 100 K in the Rb-TCNQ(II) polymorph whose magnetic susceptibility and polarized IR spectra indicate a BOW phase.
doc	On Tunnelling Through the Black Hole Horizon EOS It is shown here that there is no way for particle creation to occur by quantum tunneling through an infinitesimal neighborhood of the black hole horizon.	This result is a trivial consequence of the regularity of the horizon, the equivalence principle and the general covariance of the relativistic theory of gravity.
doc	A statistical analysis of two-dimensional patterns and its application to astrometry EOS Here we develop a general statistical procedure for the analysis of finite two-dimensional (2D) patterns inspired by the analysis of heavy-ion data. EOS The method is used in the study of publicly available data obtained by the Gaia-ESA mission. EOS We prove that the procedure can be sensitive to the limits of accuracy of measurement, and can also clearly identify the real physical effects on the large background of random distributions.	As an example, the method confirms the presence of binary and ternary star systems in the studied data.
doc	Braid Topologies for Quantum Computation EOS In topological quantum computation, quantum information is stored in states which are intrinsically protected from decoherence, and quantum gates are carried out by dragging particle-like excitations (quasiparticles) around one another in two space dimensions.	The resulting quasiparticle trajectories define world-lines in three dimensional space-time, and the corresponding quantum gates depend only on the topology of the braids formed by these world-lines.
doc	Further evidence for the _EQN_ resonance with _EQN_ around 1380 MeV EOS The unquenched quark models predict the new particle _EQN_ with spin parity _EQN_ and its mass is around the well established _EQN_ with _EQN_.	Here by using the effective Lagrangian approach we study \kp\ reaction at the range of _EQN_ peak, comparing the resulting total cross section, and _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_ invariant squared mass distributions for various incident _EQN_ momenta, as well as the production angular distribution of the _EQN_ with the data from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory 25-inch hydrogen bubble chamber, we find that, apart from the existing resonance _EQN_ with _EQN_, there is a strong evidence for the existence of the new resonance _EQN_ with _EQN_ around 1380 MeV.

doc	The 2018 X-ray and Radio Outburst of Magnetar XTE J1810-197 EOS We present the earliest X-ray observations of the 2018 outburst of XTE J1810-197, the first outburst since its 2003 discovery as the prototypical transient and radio-emitting anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP). EOS The Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) detected XTE J1810-197 immediately after a November 20-26 visibility gap, contemporaneous with its reactivation as a radio pulsar, first observed on December 8. EOS On December 13 the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NUSTAR) detected X-ray emission up to at least 30 keV, with a spectrum well-characterized by a blackbody plus power-law model with temperature kT = 0.74+/-0.02 keV and photon index Gamma = 4.4+/-0.2 or by a two-blackbody model with kT = 0.59+/-0.04 keV and kT = 1.0+/-0.1 keV, both including an additional power-law component to account for emission above 10 keV, with Gamma_h = -0.2+/-1.5 and Gamma_h = 1.5+/-0.5, respectively. EOS The latter index is consistent with hard X-ray flux reported for the non-transient magnetars. EOS In the 2-10 keV bandpass, the absorbed flux is 2E-10 erg/s/cm^2, a factor of 2 greater than the maximum flux extrapolated for the 2003 outburst. EOS The peak of the sinusoidal X-ray pulse lags the radio pulse by approx. EOS 0.13 cycles, consistent with their phase relationship during the 2003 outburst.	This suggests a stable geometry in which radio emission originates on magnetic field lines containing currents that heat a spot on the neutron star surface.
doc	Coupled magnetic and ferroelectric domains in multiferroic Ni3V2O8 EOS Electric control of multiferroic domains is demonstrated through polarized magnetic neutron diffraction. EOS Cooling to the cycloidal multiferroic phase of Ni3V2O8 in an electric field (E) causes the incommensurate Bragg reflections to become neutron spin polarizing, the sense of neutron polarization reversing with E. EOS Quantitative analysis indicates the E-treated sample has handedness that can be reversed by E.	We further show close association between cycloidal and ferroelectric domains through E-driven spin and electric polarization hysteresis.
doc	Double beta decay in left-right symmetric models EOS Left-right symmetric models provide a natural framework for neutrinoless double beta (_EQN_) decay. EOS In the analysis of _EQN_ decay in left-right symmetric models, however, it is usually assumed that all neutrinos are light. EOS On the other hand, heavy right-handed neutrinos appear quite naturally in left-right symmetric models and should therefore not be neglected.	Assuming the existence of at least one right-handed heavy neutrino, absence of _EQN_ decay of _EQN_ Ge currently provides the following limits on the mass and mixing angle of right-handed W-bosons: _EQN_ TeV and _EQN_ for a particular value of the effective right-handed neutrino mass, _EQN_ TeV, and in the limit of infinitly massive doubly charged Higgs (_EQN_).
doc	1,000-Fold Enhancement of Light-Induced Magnetism in Plasmonic Au Nanoparticles EOS Strategies for ultrafast optical control of magnetism have been a topic of intense research for several decades because of the potential impact in technologies such as magnetic memory, spintronics, and quantum computation, as well as the opportunities for non-linear optical control and modulation in applications such as optical isolation and non-reciprocity. EOS Here we report the first experimental quantification of optically induced magnetization in plasmonic Au nanoparticles due to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE).	The induced magnetic moment in nanoparticles is found to be ~1,000x larger than that observed in bulk Au, and ~20x larger than the magnetic moment from optimized magnetic nanoparticle colloids such as magnetite.
doc	A Locally Adapting Technique for Boundary Detection using Image Segmentation EOS Rapid growth in the field of quantitative digital image analysis is paving the way for researchers to make precise measurements about objects in an image. EOS To compute quantities from the image such as the density of compressed materials or the velocity of a shockwave, we must determine object boundaries. EOS Images containing regions that each have a spatial trend in intensity are of particular interest. EOS We present a supervised image segmentation method that incorporates spatial information to locate boundaries between regions with overlapping intensity histograms. EOS The segmentation of a pixel is determined by comparing its intensity to distributions from local, nearby pixel intensities.	Because of the statistical nature of the algorithm, we use maximum likelihood estimation theory to quantify uncertainty about each boundary.

doc	Dynamical formation of a hairy black hole in a cavity from the decay of unstable solitons EOS Recent numerical relativity simulations within the Einstein--Maxwell--(charged-)Klein-Gordon (EMcKG) system have shown that the non-linear evolution of a superradiantly unstable Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole (BH) enclosed in a cavity, leads to the formation of a BH with scalar hair. EOS Perturbative evidence for the stability of such hairy BHs has been independently established, confirming they are the true endpoints of the superradiant instability. EOS The same EMcKG system admits also charged scalar soliton-type solutions, which can be either stable or unstable. EOS Using numerical relativity techniques, we provide evidence that the time evolution of some of these _EQN_ solitons leads, again, to the formation of a hairy BH. EOS In some other cases, unstable solitons evolve into a (bald) Reissner-Nordstr\"om BH.	These results establish that the system admits two distinct channels to form hairy BHs at the threshold of superradiance: growing hair from an unstable (bald) BH, or growing a horizon from an unstable (horizonless) soliton.
doc	Introducing EMILI: Computer Aided Emission Line Identification EOS The identification of spectral lines can be a tedious process requiring the interrogation of large spectroscopic databases, but it does lend itself to software algorithms that can determine the characteristics of candidate line identifications. EOS We present here criteria used for the identification of lines and a logic developed for a line identification software package called EMILI, which uses the v2.04 Atomic Line List as the basic line database. EOS EMILI considers all possible database transitions within the wavelength uncertainties for observed optical emission lines and computes an approximate intensity for each candidate line. EOS It searches for other multiplet members that are expected to be seen with each candidate line, and rank orders all of the tentative line identifications for each observed line based on a set of criteria.	When applied to the spectra of the Orion Nebula and the planetary nebula IC 418, EMILI's recommended line ID's agree well with those of previous traditional manual line assignments.

EOS In this setting only the detecting sensors report their locations to the fusion center. EOS It is proven that if the radius of detection is not known to the fusion center, a minimum variance unbiased (MVU) estimator does not exist. EOS Also it is shown that when the radius is known the center of mass of the possible target region is the MVU estimator. EOS In addition, a sub-optimum estimator is introduced whose performance is close to the MVU estimator but is preferred computationally.	Furthermore, minimal sufficient statistics have been provided, both when the detection radius is known and when it is not.
doc	Dynamic response functions of two-dimensional Dirac fermions with screened Coulomb and short-range interactions EOS We consider a screened Coulomb interaction between electrons in graphene and determine their dynamic response functions, such as a longitudinal and a transverse electric conductivity and a polarization function and compare them to the corresponding quantities in the short-range interaction model.	The calculations are performed to all orders for short-range interaction by taking into account the self-energy renormalization of the electron velocity and using a ladder approximation to account for the vertex corrections, ensuring that the Ward identity (charge conservation law) is satisfied.
doc	Inexpensive LED-based spectrophotometer for analyzing optical coatings EOS Optical coatings are widespread in everyday life, from camera lenses to glasses, to complex optics experiments. EOS A simple, reliable device that can quickly and inexpensively analyze optical coatings is a valuable laboratory tool. EOS Such a device can identify unknown or mislabelled optics, and characterize the transmission spectra of optical elements used in an experiment. EOS We present the design and characterization of a LED-based spectrophotometer, and demonstrate its ability to identify different optical coatings. EOS Our approach uses ten LEDs that cover a spectrum from 365 nm to 1000 nm.	A small servomotor and microcontroller rotates a LED board to sequentially position each LED over an optical sample, and the transmitted light corresponding to each LED is measured with a silicon photodetector.
doc	Observation of the two way shape memory effect in an atomistic model of martensitic transformation EOS We study a system of classical particles in two dimensions interacting through an isotropic pair potential that displays a martensitic phase transition between a triangular and a rhomboidal structure upon the change of a single parameter. EOS Previously it was shown that this potential is able to reproduce the shape memory effect and super-elasticity, among other well known features of the phenomenology of martensites. EOS Here we extend those previous studies and describe the development of the more subtle two-way shape memory effect.	We show that in a poly-crystalline sample, the effect can be associated to the existence of retained martensite within the austenite phase.
doc	Localization of gravity in brane world with arbitrary extra dimensions EOS We study the induced 4-dimensional linearized Einstein field equations in an m-dimensional bulk space by means of a confining potential. EOS It is shown that in this approach the mass of graviton is quantized.	The cosmological constant problem is also addressed within the context of this approach.
doc	Multispectral Kerr frequency comb initiated by Faraday ripples EOS In a uniform microresonator, the generation of a broadband Kerr frequency comb is triggered by Turing patterns. EOS Here, we study a distinctly different route to initiate the Kerr frequency comb by Faraday ripples. EOS Momentum conservation is ensured by azimuthal modulation of the cavity dispersion. EOS With a good agreement with the theoretical analysis, we demonstrate a multispectral Kerr frequency comb covering telecommunication O, C, L, and 2 \mu m bands.	Comb coherence and absence of a subcomb offset are confirmed by cw heterodyne beat note and amplitude noise spectra measurements.
doc	String Theory and the Path to Unification: A Review of Recent Developments EOS This is a pedagogical review article surveying the various approaches towards understanding gauge coupling unification within string theory. EOS As is well known, one of the major problems confronting string phenomenology has been an apparent discrepancy between the scale of gauge coupling unification predicted within string theory, and the unification scale expected within the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). EOS In this article, I provide an overview of the different approaches that have been taken in recent years towards reconciling these two scales, and outline some of the major recent developments in each. EOS These approaches include 1) string GUT models; EOS 2) higher affine levels and non-standard hypercharge normalizations; EOS 3) heavy string threshold corrections; EOS 4) light supersymmetric thresholds; EOS 5) effects from intermediate-scale gauge and matter structure beyond the MSSM;	6) strings without supersymmetry;
doc	Fractional Quantum Hall Effect in the Second Landau Level: the Importance of Inter-Composite-Fermion Interaction EOS Exact diagonalization of a two-dimensional electron gas in a strong magnetic field in the disk geometry shows that there exists a filling factor range in the second Landau level where the states significantly differ from those in the lowest Landau level. EOS We show that the difference arises because the interaction between composite fermions is not negligible in higher Landau levels, as indicated by a substantial mixing between composite-fermion Landau-like levels, or lambda levels.	We find that the exact ground state is well reproduced by composite fermion theory with lambda level mixing incorporated at the lowest level of approximation.
doc	Integrable models of interacting quantum spins with competing interactions EOS We present a class of exactly solvable quantum spin models which consist of two Heisenberg-subsystems coupled via a long-range Lieb-Mattis interaction. EOS The total system is exactly solvable whenever the individual subsystems are solvable and allows to study the effects of frustration.	We consider (i) the antiferromagnetic linear chain and (ii) the Lieb-Mattis antiferromagnet for the subsystem-Hamiltonians and present (i) the complete ground-state phase diagram and (ii) the full thermodynamic phase diagram.
doc	Same-sign Higgsino Production at the CERN LHC: How Not to Hunt for Natural Supersymmetry EOS We examine the prospects for detecting light charged higgsinos that are expected to be a necessary feature of natural SUSY models via _EQN_ processes arising dominantly from _EQN_ fusion at LHC13. EOS The signal will be a pair of same-sign leptons (_EQN_ or _EQN_) in events with two relatively forward, hemispherically-separated jets with a large rapidity gap. EOS We find that even though the higgsinos have a full-strength _EQN_ gauge couplings to _EQN_ -bosons, the LHC13 cross section for the production of same sign higgsino pairs is smaller than 0.02 fb over most of the interesting range of natural SUSY parameters, even before leptonic branching fractions of the chargino are included.	This cross section is strongly suppressed because the two neutral Majorana higgsinos can be combined into a single Dirac neutralino if the bino and the winos are much heavier than the higgsinos, as is the case in natural SUSY models: in this limit, higgsino couplings to _EQN_ -bosons exhibit an emergent (approximate) _EQN_ global symmetry that suppresses same sign higgsino production by vector boson fusion.
doc	Anisotropic contribution to the van der Waals and the Casimir-Polder energies for CO _EQN_ and CH _EQN_ molecules near surfaces and thin films	In order to understand why carbon dioxide (CO _EQN_) and methane (CH _EQN_) molecules interact differently with surfaces, we investigate the Casimir-Polder energy of a linearly polarizable CO _EQN_ molecule and an isotropically polarizable CH _EQN_ molecule in front of an atomically thin gold film and an amorphous silica slab.
doc	V2V Propagation Modeling with Imperfect RSSI Samples EOS We describe three in-field data collection efforts yielding a large database of RSSI values vs. EOS time or distance from vehicles communicating with each other via DSRC. EOS We show several data processing schemes we have devised to develop Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) propagation models from such data. EOS The database is limited in several important ways, not least, the presence of a high noise floor that limits the distance over which good modeling is feasible. EOS Another is the presence of interference from multiple active transmitters. EOS Our methodology makes it possible to obtain, despite these limitations, accurate models of median path loss vs.	distance, shadow fading, and fast fading caused by multipath.

doc	Temperature dependence of transport spin polarization in NdNi5 measured using Point Contact Andreev reflection EOS We report a study in which Point contact Andreev reflection (PCAR) spectroscopy using superconducting Nb tip has been carried out on NdNi5, a ferromagnet with a Curie temperature of TC~7.7K. EOS The measurements were carried out over a temperature range of 2-9K which spans across the ferromagnetic transition temperature. EOS From an analysis of the spectra, we show that (i) the temperature dependence of the extracted value of transport spin polarization closely follows the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization;	(ii) the superconducting quasiparticle lifetime shows a large decrease close to the Curie temperature of the ferromagnet.
doc	Modulus D-term Inflation	We propose a new model of single-field D-term inflation in supergravity, where the inflation is driven by a single modulus field which transforms non-linearly under the U(1) gauge symmetry.
doc	Magnetic ordering phenomena of interacting quantum spin Hall models EOS The two-dimensional Hubbard model defined for topological band structures exhibiting a quantum spin Hall effect poses fundamental challenges in terms of phenomenological characterization and microscopic classification. EOS In the limit of infinite coupling U at half filling, the spin model Hamiltonians resulting from a strong coupling expansion show various forms of magnetic ordering phenomena depending on the underlying spin-orbit coupling terms. EOS We investigate the infinite U limit of the Kane-Mele Hubbard model with z-axis intrinsic spin-orbit coupling as well as its generalization to a generically multi-directional spin orbit term which has been claimed to account for the physical scenario in monolayer Na2IrO3. EOS We find that the axial spin symmetry which is kept in the former but broken in the latter has a fundamental impact on the magnetic phase diagram as we vary the spin orbit coupling strength.	While the Kane-Mele spin model shows a continuous evolution from conventional honeycomb Neel to XY antiferromagnetism which avoids the frustration imposed by the increased spin-orbit coupling, the multi-directional spin-orbit term induces a commensurate to incommensurate transition at intermediate coupling strength, and yields a complex spiral state with a 72 site unit cell in the limit of infinite spin-orbit coupling.
doc	D-Algebra Structure of Topological Insulators EOS In the quantum Hall effect, the density operators at different wave-vectors generally do not commute and give rise to the Girvin MacDonald Plazmann (GMP) algebra with important consequences such as ground-state center of mass degeneracy at fractional filling fraction, and W_ 1 + \infty symmetry of the filled Landau levels. EOS We show that the natural generalization of the GMP algebra to higher dimensional topological insulators involves the concept of a D-algebra formed by using the fully anti-symmetric tensor in D-dimensions. EOS For insulators in even dimensional space, the D-algebra is isotropic and closes for the case of constant non-Abelian F(k) ^ F(k)... EOS ^ F(k) connection (D-Berry curvature), and its structure factors are proportional to the D/2-Chern number. EOS In odd dimensions, the algebra is not isotropic, contains the weak topological insulator index (layers of the topological insulator in one less dimension) and does not contain the Chern-Simons \theta form (F ^ A - 2/3 A ^ A ^ A in 3 dimensions).	The Chern-Simons form appears in a certain combination of the parallel transport and simple translation operator which is not an algebra.
doc	Properties of baryon anti-decuplet EOS We study the group structure of baryon anti-decuplet containing the _EQN_. EOS We derive the SU(3) mass relations among the pentaquark baryons in the anti-decuplet, when there is either no mixing or ideal mixing with the pentaquark octet, as advocated by Jaffe and Wilczek. EOS This constitutes the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass formula for the pentaquark baryons.	We also derive SU(3) symmetric Lagrangian for the interactions of the baryons in the anti-decuplet with the meson octet and the baryon octet.
doc	Hydrodynamic Approach to Vortex Lifetime in Trapped Bose Condensates EOS We study a vortex in a two-dimensional, harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. EOS Through a variational calculation using a trial condensate wave function and a nonlinear Schroedinger Lagrangian, we obtain the effective potential experienced by a vortex at an arbitrary position in the condensate, and find that an off-center vortex will move in a circular trajectory around the trap center. EOS We find the frequency of this precession to be smaller than the elementary excitation frequencies in the cloud.	We also study the radiation of sound from a moving vortex in an infinite, uniform system, and discuss the validity of this as an approximation for the trapped case.
doc	Lattice Boltzmann model for ultra-relativistic flows EOS We develop a relativistic lattice Boltzmann model capable of describing relativistic fluid dynamics at ultra-high velocities, with Lorentz factors up to _EQN_. EOS To this purpose, we first build a new lattice kinetic scheme by expanding the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution function in an orthogonal basis of polynomials and applying an appropriate quadrature, providing the discrete versions of the relativistic Boltzmann equation and the equilibrium distribution. EOS To achieve ultra-high velocities, we include a flux limiter scheme, and introduce the bulk viscosity by a suitable extension of the discrete relativistic Boltzmann equation. EOS The model is validated by performing simulations of shock waves in viscous quark-gluon plasmas and comparing with existing models, finding very good agreement. EOS To the best of our knowledge, we for the first time successfully simulate viscous shock waves in the highly relativistic regime. EOS Moreover, we show that our model can also be used for near-inviscid flows even at very high velocities.	Finally, as an astrophysical application, we simulate a relativistic shock wave, generated by, say, a supernova explosion, colliding with a massive interstellar cloud, e.g.
doc	Observations of the extreme runaway HD271791: nucleosynthesis in a core-collapse supernova EOS Some young, massive stars can be found in the Galactic halo. EOS As star formation is unlikely to occur in the halo, they must have been formed in the disk and been ejected shortly afterwards. EOS One explanation is a supernova in a tight binary system. EOS The companion is ejected and becomes a runaway star. EOS HD\,271791 is the kinematically most extreme runaway star known (Galactic restframe velocity _EQN_, which is even larger than the Galactic escape velocity). EOS Moreover, an analysis of the optical spectrum showed an enhancement of the _EQN_ -process elements. EOS This indicates the capture of supernova ejecta, and therefore an origin in a core-collapse supernova. EOS As such high space velocities are not reached by the runaway stars in classical binary supernova ejection scenarios, a very massive but compact primary, probably of Wolf-Rayet type is required. EOS HD\,271791 is therefore a perfect candidate for studying nucleosynthesis in a supernova of probably type Ibc. EOS The goal of this project is to determine the abundances of a large number of elements from the _EQN_ -process, the iron group, and heavier elements by a quantitative analysis of the optical and UV spectral range. EOS Detailed line-formation calculations are employed that account for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE).	We intend to verify whether core-collapse supernova are a site of r-process element production.
doc	Phenomenology of minimal theory of quasidilaton massive gravity EOS The minimal theory of quasidilaton massive gravity with or without a Horndeski-type kinetic term for the quasidilaton field propagates only three physical modes: the two massive tensor polarizations and one scalar mode. EOS This reduced number of degrees of freedom is realized by a Lorentz symmetry violation at cosmological scales and the presence of appropriate constraints that remove unwanted modes. EOS Vacuum cosmological solutions have been considered in a previous work, and it has been shown that the late-time de Sitter attractor is stable under inhomogeneous perturbations. EOS In this work, we explore the stability of cosmological solutions in the presence of matter fields.	Assuming for simplicity that the quasidilaton scalar is on an attractor at the level of the background, we derive stability conditions in the subhorizon limit, and find the scalar sound speeds, as well as the modification with respect to general relativity to the gravitational potential in the quasistatic approximation.

doc	Norm formulas for finite groups and induction from elementary abelian subgroups EOS It is known that the norm map N_G for a finite group G acting on a ring R is surjective if and only if for every elementary abelian subgroup E of G the norm map N_E for E is surjective. EOS Equivalently, there exists an element x_G in R with N_G(x_G) = 1 if and only for every elementary abelian subgroup E there exists an element x_E in R such that N_E(x_E) = 1. EOS When the ring R is noncommutative, it is an open problem to find an explicit formula for x_G in terms of the elements x_E.	In this paper we present a method to solve this problem for an arbitrary group G and an arbitrary group action on a ring.Using this method, we obtain a complete solution of the problem for the quaternion and the dihedral 2-groups,and for a group of order 27.
doc	Stability and moduli spaces of syzygy bundles EOS It is a longstanding problem in Algebraic Geometry to determine whether the syzygy bundle _EQN_ on _EQN_ defined as the kernel of a general epimorphism \[\phi:\mathcal O (-d_1)\oplus...\oplus\mathcal O (-d_n) \to\mathcal O \] is (semi)stable. EOS In this thesis, attention is restricted to the case of syzygy bundles _EQN_ on _EQN_ associated to _EQN_ generic forms _EQN_ of the same degree _EQN_, for _EQN_. EOS The first goal is to prove that _EQN_ is stable if \[N+1\le n\le\tbinom d+N N,\] except for the case _EQN_. EOS The second is to study moduli spaces of stable rank _EQN_ vector bundles on _EQN_ containing syzygy bundles.	In a joint work with Laura Costa and Rosa Mar \'\i a Mir\'o-Roig, we prove that _EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_ are as above, then the syzygy bundle _EQN_ is unobstructed and it belongs to a generically smooth irreducible component of dimension _EQN_, if _EQN_, and _EQN_, if _EQN_.
doc	Practical photoemission characterization of molecular films and related interfaces EOS Even though the term `organic electronics' evokes rather organic devices, a significant part of its scope deals with physical properties of `active elements' such as organic films and interfaces. EOS Examination of the film growth and the evolution of the interface formation are particularly needful for the understanding a mechanism controlling their final properties. EOS Performing such experiments in an ultra-high vacuum allows both to `stretch' the time scale for pseudo real-time observations and to control properties of the probed systems on the atomic level. EOS Photoemission technique probes directly electronic and chemical structure and it has thereby established among major tools employed in the field. EOS This review primarily focuses to electronic properties of oligomeric molecular films and their interfaces examined by photoemission. EOS Yet, it does not aspire after a complete overview on the topic; EOS it rather aims to otherwise standard issues encountered at the photoemission characterization and analysis of the organic materials, though requiring to consider particularities of molecular films in terms of the growth, electronic properties, and their characterization and analysis.	In particular, the fundamental electronic parameters of molecular films such as the work function, the ionization energy, and the interfacial energy level alignment, and their interplay, will be pursued with considering often neglected influence of the molecular orientation.
doc	Systematic Study Of Leptonic Mixing In A Class Of SU_H(2) Models EOS We perform a systematic analysis of the PMNS matrices which arise when one assigns the three generations of leptons to the _EQN_ representation of a horizontal _EQN_ symmetry. EOS This idea has been previously explored by Kuchimanchi and Mohapatra. EOS However, we assume _EQN_ the neutrino mass matrix results from leptonic couplings to _EQN_ triplet scalar fields and _EQN_ hierarchies exist amongst lepton mass matrix elements which result from couplings to scalar fields with different _EQN_ charges. EOS Of the sixteen candidate PMNS matrices which result it is found that only one is both predictive and possesses a leading order structure compatible with experimental data. EOS The relevant neutrino mass matrix displays the symmetry _EQN_ to leading order and we explore the perturbations required to produce a realistic lepton spectrum.	The effective mass in neutrinoless double beta decay is required to lie in the range _EQN_, which is just below current experimental bounds.
doc	A novel energy-conserving scheme for eight-dimensional systems EOS We design a novel, exactly energy-conserving implicit non-symplectic integration method for an eight-dimensional Hamiltonian system with four degrees of freedom. EOS In our algorithm, each partial derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to one of phase-space variables is discretized by the average of eight Hamiltonian difference terms. EOS Such a discretization form is a second-order approximation to the Hamiltonian gradient. EOS It is shown numerically via simulations of an FPU- _EQN_ system and a post-Newtonian conservative system of compact binaries with one body spinning that the newly proposed method has extremely good energy-conserving performance, compared to the Runge-Kutta, implicit midpoint symplectic method and extended phase-space explicit symplectic-like integrators. EOS The new method is advantageous over very long times and for large time steps compared to state-of-the-art Runge-Kutta method in the accuracy of numerical solutions. EOS Although such an energy-conserving integrator exhibits a higher computational cost than any one of the other three algorithms, the superior results justify its use for satisfying some specific purposes on the preservation of energies in numerical simulations with much longer times, e.g.	obtaining a high enough accuracy of the semimajor axis in a Keplerian problem in the Solar System or accurately grasping the frequency of a gravitational wave from a circular orbit in a post-Newtonian system of compact binaries.
doc	Positivity and Kodaira embedding theorem EOS Kodaira embedding theorem provides an effective characterization of projectivity of a K\"ahler manifold in terms the second cohomology. EOS Recently X. EOS Yang  proved that any compact K\"ahler manifold with positive holomorphic sectional curvature must be projective. EOS This gives a metric criterion of the projectivity in terms of its curvature.	In this note, we prove that any compact K\"ahler manifold with positive 2nd scalar curvature (which is the average of holomorphic sectional curvature over 2-dimensional subspaces of the tangent space) must be projective.

doc	Nonlinear Pulse Evolutions in the Laser Wakefield Accelerator through a new Quasi-Static Theory EOS Beginning from the set of cold-fluid plus Maxwell equations in the instantaneous, Lorentz-boosted Pulse Co-Moving Frame (PCMF), a new quasi-static theory is developed to describe the nonlinear pulse evolutions due to the wakefield excitation, and is verified through comparison with particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. EOS According to this theory, the plasma-motion can be treated perturbatively and produces quasi-static wakefield in the PCMF, and the pulse envelope is governed by a form of the Schrodinger equation. EOS The pulse evolutions are characterized by local conservation laws resulted from this equation and subjected to Lorentz transformation into the laboratory frame.	In this context, new formulas describing the time-behaviors of group velocity, wake amplitude and carrier frequency are derived and best confirmed by simulation data.
doc	Cosmological Singularities and a Conjectured Gravity/Coset Correspondence EOS We review the recently discovered connection between the Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-like ``chaotic'' structure of generic cosmological singularities in eleven-dimensional supergravity and the ``last'' hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebra E(10).	This intriguing connection suggests the existence of a hidden ``correspondence'' between supergravity (or even M-theory) and null geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional coset space K(E(10)).
doc	A Brief History of Curvature EOS The trace of the stress-energy tensor of the cosmological fluid, proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature in general relativity, is determined on cosmic scales for times ranging from the inflationary epoch to the present day in the expanding Universe.	The post-inflationary epoch and the thermal history of the relativistic fluid, in particular the QCD transition from asymptotic freedom to confinement and the electroweak phase transition, leave significant imprints on the scalar curvature.
doc	Evolved QCD predictions for the meson-photon transition form factors EOS The QCD evolution of the pion distribution amplitude (DA) _EQN_ is computed for several commonly used models. EOS Our analysis includes the nonperturbative form predicted by light-front holographic QCD, thus combining the nonperturbative bound state dynamics of the pion with the perturbative ERBL evolution of the pion distribution amplitude. EOS We calculate the meson-photon transition form factors for the _EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_ using the hard-scattering formalism. EOS We point out that a widely-used approximation of replacing _EQN_ with _EQN_ in the calculations will unjustifiably reduce the predictions for the meson-photon transition form factors. EOS It is found that the four models of the pion DA discussed give very different predictions for the _EQN_ dependence of the meson-photon transition form factors in the region of _EQN_ GeV _EQN_. EOS More accurate measurements of these transition form factors at the large _EQN_ region will be able to distinguish the four models of the pion DA. EOS The rapid growth of the large _EQN_ data for the pion-photon transition form factor reported by the BaBar Collaboration is difficult to explain within the current framework of QCD.	If the BaBar data for the meson-photon transition form factor for the _EQN_ is confirmed, it could indicate physics beyond-the-standard model, such as a weakly-coupled elementary _EQN_ axial vector or pseudoscalar _EQN_ in the few GeV domain, an elementary field which would provide the coupling _EQN_ _EQN_ to _EQN_ to _EQN_ at leading twist.
doc	Dark matter: A phenomenological existence proof EOS The non-Keplerian galactic rotational curves and the gravitational lensing data strongly indicate a significant dark matter component in the universe. EOS Moreover, these data can be combined to deduce the equation of state of dark matter. EOS Yet, the existence of dark matter has been challenged following the tradition of critical scientific spirit. EOS In the process, the theory of general relativity itself has been questioned and various modified theories of gravitation have been proposed.	Within the framework of the Einsteinian general relativity, here I make the observation that if the universe is described by a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology with Einsteinian cosmological constant then the resulting cosmology predicts a significant dark matter component in the universe.
doc	Pure-Higgs states from the Lefschetz-Sommese theorem EOS We consider a special class of N=4 quiver quantum mechanics relevant in the description of BPS states of D4D0 branes in type II Calabi-Yau compactifications and the corresponding 4-dimensional black holes. EOS These quivers have two abelian nodes in addition to an arbitrary number of non-abelian nodes and satisfy some simple but stringent conditions on the set of arrows, in particular closed oriented loops are always present. EOS The Higgs branch can be described as the vanishing locus of a section of a vector bundle over a product of a projective space with a number of Grassmannians.	The Lefschetz-Sommese theorem then allows to separate induced from singular cohomology which leads to the notion of pure-Higgs states.
doc	Diphoton Excess at 750 GeV in leptophobic U(1) _EQN_ model inspired by _EQN_ GUT EOS We discuss the 750 GeV diphoton excess at the LHC@13TeV in the framework of leptophobic U(1) _EQN_ model inspired by _EQN_ grand unified theory (GUT). EOS In this model, the Standard Model (SM) chiral fermions carry charges under extra U(1) _EQN_ gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken by a U(1) _EQN_ -charged singlet scalar (_EQN_). EOS In addition, extra quarks and leptons are introduced to achieve the anomaly-free conditions, which is a natural consequence of the assumed _EQN_ GUT. EOS These new fermions are vectorlike under the SM gauge group but chiral under new U(1) _EQN_, and their masses come entirely from the nonzero vacuum expectation value of _EQN_ through the Yukawa interactions.	Then, the CP-even scalar _EQN_ from _EQN_ can be produced at the LHC by the gluon fusion and decay to the diphoton via the one-loop diagram involving the extra quarks and leptons, and can be identified as the origin of diphoton excess at 750 GeV.
doc	Reexamination of _EQN_ Li scattering as a Probe to Investigate the Isoscalar Giant Resonances in Nuclei EOS Inelastic _EQN_ Li scattering at 100 MeV/u on _EQN_ C and _EQN_ Nb have been measured with the high-resolution magnetic spectrometer Grand Raiden. EOS The magnetic-rigidity settings of the spectrometer covered excitation energies from 10 to 40 MeV and scattering angles in the range _EQN_. EOS The isoscalar giant monopole resonance was selectively excited in the present data. EOS Measurements free of instrumental background and the very favorable resonance-to-continuum ratio of _EQN_ Li scattering allowed for precise determination of the _EQN_ strengths in _EQN_ C and _EQN_ Nb. EOS It was found that the monopole strength in _EQN_ C exhausts _EQN_ \% of the energy-weighted sum rule (EWSR), which is considerably higher than results from previous _EQN_ -scattering experiments.	The monopole strength in _EQN_ Nb exhausts _EQN_ \% of the EWSR, and it is consistent with measurements of nuclei with mass number of _EQN_.
doc	Naturalness of electroweak physics within minimal supergravity EOS Low energy supersymmetry is motivated by its use as a solution to the hierarchy problem of the electroweak scale. EOS Having motivated this model with naturalness arguments, it is then necessary to check whether the experimentally allowed parameter space permits realisations of the model with low fine tuning. EOS The scope of this thesis is a study of naturalness of the electroweak physics in the minimal supergravity model. EOS The latest experimental constraints are applied, and the fine tuning is quantitatively evaluated for a scan across the parameter space. EOS The fine tuning of the electroweak scale is evaluated at 2-loop order, and the fine tuning of the neutralino dark matter thermal relic energy density is also determined. EOS The natural regions of the parameter space are identified and the associated phenomenology relevant for detection discussed. EOS Naturalness limits are also found for the parameter space and spectrum. EOS The minimum fine tuning found is 1 part in 9 when dark matter constraints are neglected, and 1 part in 15 when dark matter constraints are satisfied. EOS For both cases, the minimum fine tuning is found for a Higgs mass of 115 GeV irrespective of whether the Higgs mass constraint is applied or not.	The most natural spectrum includes light superpartner fermions, and heavy superpartner scalars.

doc	The unlikely Carnot efficiency EOS The efficiency of an heat engine is traditionally defined as the ratio of its average output work over its average input heat. EOS Its highest possible value was discovered by Carnot in 1824 and is a cornerstone concept in thermodynamics. EOS It led to the discovery of the second law and to the definition of the Kelvin temperature scale. EOS Small-scale engines operate in the presence of highly fluctuating input and output energy fluxes. EOS They are therefore much better characterized by fluctuating efficiencies. EOS In this study, using the fluctuation theorem, we identify universal features of efficiency fluctuations. EOS While the standard thermodynamic efficiency is, as expected, the most likely value, we find that the Carnot efficiency is, surprisingly, the least likely in the long time limit.	Furthermore the probability distribution for the efficiency assumes a universal scaling form when operating close-to-equilibrium.

doc	Fast Transformers with Clustered Attention EOS Transformers have been proven a successful model for a variety of tasks in sequence modeling. EOS However, computing the attention matrix, which is their key component, has quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length, thus making them prohibitively expensive for large sequences. EOS To address this, we propose clustered attention, which instead of computing the attention for every query, groups queries into clusters and computes attention just for the centroids. EOS To further improve this approximation, we use the computed clusters to identify the keys with the highest attention per query and compute the exact key/query dot products. EOS This results in a model with linear complexity with respect to the sequence length for a fixed number of clusters.	We evaluate our approach on two automatic speech recognition datasets and show that our model consistently outperforms vanilla transformers for a given computational budget.

EOS In order to use the data from these surveys to understand the Galactic stellar population, we need to be sure that stars contained in a survey are a representative subset of the underlying population. EOS Without the selection function taken into account, the results might reflect the properties of the selection function rather than those of the underlying stellar population. EOS Aims. EOS In this work, we introduce a method to estimate the selection function for a given spectroscopic survey. EOS We apply this method to a large sample of public spectroscopic surveys. EOS Methods. EOS We apply a median division binning algorithm to bin observed stars in the colour-magnitude space. EOS This approach produces lower uncertainties and lower biases of the selection function estimate as compared to traditionally used 2D-histograms. EOS We run a set of simulations to verify the method and calibrate the one free parameter it contains. EOS These simulations allow us to test the precision and accuracy of the method. EOS Results. EOS We produce and publish estimated values and uncertainties of selection functions for a large sample of public spectroscopic surveys. EOS We publicly release the code used to produce the selection function estimates. EOS Conclusions.	The effect of the selection function on distance modulus and metallicity distributions of stars in surveys is important for surveys with small and largely inhomogeneous spatial coverage.

Using the temperature-window fitting technique, we obtained the critical exponents which agreed with the three-dimensional (3D) Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) universality class at both sides of the lower critical field and the saturation field.
doc	Local independence of fractional Brownian motion EOS Let S(t,t') be the sigma-algebra generated by the differences X(s)-X(s) with s,s' in the interval(t,t'), where (X_t) is the fractional Brownian motion process with Hurst index H between 0 and 1. EOS We prove that for any two distinct t and t' the sigma-algebras S(t-a,t+a) and S(t'-a,t'+a) are asymptotically independent as a tends to 0.	We show this in the strong sense that Shannon's mutual information between these two sigma-algebras tends to zero as a tends to 0.
doc	Non-tangential limits for analytic Lipschitz functions EOS Let _EQN_ be a bounded open subset of the complex plane. EOS Let _EQN_ and let _EQN_ denote the space of functions that satisfy a Lipschitz condition with exponent _EQN_ on the complex plane, are analytic on _EQN_ and are such that for each _EQN_, there exists _EQN_ such that for all _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_ whenever _EQN_.	We show that if a boundary point _EQN_ for _EQN_ admits a bounded point derivation for _EQN_ and _EQN_ has an interior cone at _EQN_ then one can evaluate the bounded point derivation by taking a limit of a difference quotient over a non-tangential ray to _EQN_.

doc	Dynamics of magnetization and carriers at the onset of the photo-excited precession of magnetization in (Ga,Mn)As EOS Photo-excited precession of magnetization in (Ga,Mn)As is investigated by measuring time-resolved magneto-optical response and transient differential reflectivity with pump-and-probe technique. EOS In the time region less than 1 ps, rapidly oscillating and spike-like signals are observed, respectively, with excitation of below and above the GaAs band gap.	Analysis with gyromagnetic model and autocorrelation function concludes that those signals are not attributed to ultrafast demagnetization but due to interference between pump and probe pulses incorporating sub-ps carrier dynamics characteristic of low-temperature grown semiconductors.
doc	Future stability of the FLRW spacetime for a large class of perfect fluids EOS We establish the future non-linear stability of Friedmann-Lema^ \i treRobertson-Walker (FLRW) solutions to the Einstein-Euler equations of the universe filled with a large class of Makino-type fluids (the equations of state are allowed to be certain nonlinear or linear types both). EOS Several previous results as specific examples can be covered in the results of this article.	We emphasize that the future stability of FLRW metric for polytropic fluids with positive cosmological constant has been a difficult problem and can not be directly generalized from the previous known results.
doc	Strain induced Chiral Magnetic Effect in Weyl semimetals EOS We argue that strain applied to a time-reversal and inversion breaking Weyl semi-metal in a magnetic field can induce an electric current via the chiral magnetic effect. EOS A tight binding model is used to show that strain generically changes the locations in the Brillouin zone but also the energies of the band touching points (tips of the Weyl cones).	Since axial charge in a Weyl semi-metal can relax via inter-valley scattering processes the induced current will decay with a timescale given by the lifetime of a chiral quasiparticle.
doc	Infrared Divergences in dS/CFT EOS dS/CFT gives a perturbatively gauge invariant definition of particle masses in de Sitter (dS) space. EOS We show, in a toy model in which the graviton is replaced with a minimally coupled massless scalar field, that loop corrections to these masses are infrared (IR) divergent.	We argue that this implies anomalous dependence of masses on the cosmological constant, in a true theory of quantum gravity.
doc	Bosonization of Fermionic Fields and Fermionization of Bosonic Fields EOS In this paper using the Clifford and spin-Clifford bundles formalism we show how Weyl and Dirac equations formulated in the spin-Clifford bundle may be written in an equivalent form as generalized Maxwell like form formulated in the Clifford bundle.

doc	Very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from high-redshift blazars EOS We study the possible detection of and properties of very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission (in the energy band above 100 GeV) from high redshift sources. EOS We report on the detection of VHE gamma-ray flux from blazars with redshifts z>0.5. EOS We use the data of Fermi telescope in the energy band above 100 GeV and identify significant sources via cross-correlation of arrival directions of individual VHE gamma-rays with the positions of known Fermi sources. EOS There are thirteen high-redshift sources detected in the VHE band by Fermi/LAT telescope. EOS The present statistics of the Fermi signal from these sources is too low for a sensible study of the effects of suppression of the VHE flux by pair production through interactions with Extragalactic Background Light photons. EOS We find that the detection of these sources with ground-based gamma-ray telescopes would be challenging.	However, several sources including BL Lacs PKS 0426-380 at z=1.11, KUV 00311-1938 at z=0.61, B3 1307+433 at z=0.69, PG 1246+586 at z=0.84, Ton 116 at z=1.065 as well as a flat-spectrum radio quasar 4C +55.17 at z=0.89 should be detectable by HESS-II, MAGIC-II and CTA.
doc	Asymptotic Optimality of Massive MIMO Systems Using Densely Spaced Transmit Antennas EOS This paper investigates the performance of a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system that uses a large transmit antenna array with antenna elements spaced densely.	Under the assumption of idealized uniform linear antenna arrays without mutual coupling, precoded quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) transmission is proved to achieve the channel capacity of the massive MIMO system when the transmit antenna separation tends to zero.

doc	Mesons in the massive Schwinger model on the light-cone EOS We investigate mesons in the bosonized massive Schwinger model in the light-front Tamm-Dancoff approximation in the strong coupling region.	We confirm that the three-meson bound state has a few percent fermion six-body component in the strong coupling region when expressed in terms of fermion variables, consistent with our previous calculations.
doc	The envelope of the power spectra of over a thousand \delta Scuti stars. The _EQN_ - _EQN_ scaling relation EOS CoRoT and Kepler high-precision photometric data allowed the detection and characterization of the oscillation parameters in stars other than the Sun. EOS Moreover, thanks to the scaling relations, it is possible to estimate masses and radii for thousands of solar-type oscillating stars. EOS Recently, a \Delta\nu - \rho relation has been found for \delta Scuti stars.	Now, analyzing several hundreds of this kind of stars observed with CoRoT and Kepler, we present an empiric relation between their frequency at maximum power of their oscillation spectra and their effective temperature.
doc	Reduced phase space quantization of massive vector theory EOS We quantize massive vector theory in such a way that it has a well-defined massless limit. EOS In contrast to the approach by St\"uckelberg where ghost fields are introduced to maintain manifest Lorentz covariance, we use reduced phase space quantization with nonlocal dynamical variables which in the massless limit smoothly turn into the photons, and check explicitly that the Poincare algebra is fullfilled. EOS In contrast to conventional covariant quantization our approach leads to a propagator which has no singularity in the massless limit and is well behaved for large momenta.	For massive QED, where the vector field is coupled to a conserved fermion current, the quantum theory of the nonlocal vector fields is shown to be equivalent to that of the standard local vector fields.
doc	Excited state dynamics of some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a surface-hopping investigation EOS Here we present a computational investigation of the excited state dynamics of 5 different active medical substances (aspirin, ibuprofen, carprofen, suprofen, indomethacin) which belong to the family of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). EOS The nonadiabatic dynamics simulations were performed using the surface hopping method, with electronic energies and couplings evaluated on the fly in a semiempirical framework. EOS For aspirin, the solvent decay dynamics was also considered by inserting it in a cluster of water molecules, following a QM/MM scheme.	A quite diverse behavior was observed for the systems considered, going from fast deactivation to the ground state (aspirin and ibuprofen), to ultrafast intersystem crossing to the triplet manifold (carprofen and suprofen), or to the generation of long lived S1 states (indomethacin).
doc	Entanglement spectrum of mixed states EOS Entanglement plays an important role in our ability to understand, simulate, and harness quantum many-body phenomena. EOS In this work, we investigate the entanglement spectrum for open one-dimensional systems, and propose a natural quantifier for how much a 1D quantum state is entangled while being subject to decoherence. EOS We demonstrate our method using a simple case of single-particle evolution and find that the open system entanglement spectrum is composed of generalized concurrence values, as well as quantifiers of the state's purity.	Our proposed entanglement spectrum can be directly obtained using a correct scaling of a matrix product state decomposition of the system's density matrix.
doc	Search for high-mass diboson resonances with boson-tagged jets in proton-proton collisions at _EQN_ = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector EOS A search is performed for narrow resonances decaying into _EQN_, _EQN_, or _EQN_ boson pairs using 20.3 fb _EQN_ of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of _EQN_ = 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. EOS Diboson resonances with masses in the range from 1.3 to 3.0 TeV are sought after using the invariant mass distribution of dijets where both jets are tagged as a boson jet, compatible with a highly boosted _EQN_ or _EQN_ boson decaying to quarks, using jet mass and substructure properties. EOS The largest deviation from a smoothly falling background in the observed dijet invariant mass distribution occurs around 2 TeV in the _EQN_ channel, with a global significance of 2.5 standard deviations.	Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level are set on the production cross section times branching ratio for the _EQN_ final state of a new heavy gauge boson, _EQN_, and for the _EQN_ and _EQN_ final states of Kaluza--Klein excitations of the graviton in a bulk Randall--Sundrum model, as a function of the resonance mass.
doc	Some Properties of Dust Outside the Galactic Disk EOS The joint use of accurate near- and mid-infrared photometry from the 2MASS and WISE catalogues has allowed the variations of the extinction law and the dust grain size distribution in high Galactic latitudes (|b|>50) at distances up to 3 kpc from the Galactic midplane to be analyzed. EOS The modified method of extrapolation of the extinction law applied to clump giants has turned out to be efficient for separating the spatial variations of the sample composition, metallicity, reddening, and properties of the medium. EOS The detected spatial variations of the coefficients E(H-W1)/E(H-Ks), E(H-W2)/E(H-Ks), and E(H-W3)/E(H-Ks) are similar for all high latitudes and depend only on the distance from the Galactic midplane. EOS The ratio of short-wavelength extinction to long-wavelength one everywhere outside the Galactic disk has been found to be smaller than that in the disk and, accordingly, the mean dust grain size is larger, while the grain size distribution in the range 0.5-11 microns is shifted toward coarse dust. EOS Specifically, the mean grain size initially increases sharply with distance from the Galactic midplane, then decreases gradually, approaching a value typical of the disk at _EQN_ kpc, and, further out, stabilizes or may increase again. EOS The coefficients under consideration change with coordinate _EQN_ with a period of about 1312\pm40 pc, coinciding every 656\pm20 pc to the south and the north and showing a significant anticorrelation between their values in the southern and northern hemispheres at intermediate Z.	Thus, there exists a unified large-scale periodic structure of the interstellar medium at high latitudes within at least 5 kpc.
doc	A Novel Uplink Data Transmission Scheme For Small Packets In Massive MIMO System EOS Intelligent terminals often produce a large number of data packets of small lengths. EOS For these packets, it is inefficient to follow the conventional medium access control (MAC) protocols because they lead to poor utilization of service resources. EOS We propose a novel multiple access scheme that targets massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems based on compressive sensing (CS). EOS We employ block precoding in the time domain to enable the simultaneous transmissions of many users, which could be even more than the number of receive antennas at the base station.	We develop a block-sparse system model and adopt the block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm to recover the transmitted signals.
doc	TEC evidence for near-equatorial energy deposition by 30-keV electrons in the topside ionosphere EOS Observations of energetic electrons (10 - 300 keV) by NOAA/POES and DMSP satellites at heights <1000 km during the period from 1999 to 2010 allowed finding abnormal intense fluxes of ~10^6 - 10^7 cm-2 s-1 sr-1 for quasi-trapped electrons appearing within the forbidden zone of low latitudes over the African, Indo-China, and Pacific regions. EOS Extreme fluxes appeared often in the early morning and persisted for several hours during the maximum and recovery phase of geomagnetic storms. EOS We analyzed nine storm-time events when extreme electron fluxes first appeared in the Eastern Hemisphere, then drifted further eastward toward the South-Atlantic Anomaly. EOS Using the electron spectra, we estimated the possible ionization effect produced by quasi-trapped electrons in the topside ionosphere. EOS The estimated ionization was found to be large enough to satisfy observed storm-time increases in the ionospheric total electron content determined for the same spatial and temporal ranges from global ionospheric maps.	Additionally, extreme fluxes of quasi-trapped electrons were accompanied by the significant elevation of the low-latitude F-layer obtained from COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 radio occultation measurements.

doc	Coherent, directional supercontinuum via cascaded dispersive wave generation EOS We demonstrate a novel approach to producing coherent, directional supercontinuum via cascaded dispersive wave generation. EOS By pumping in the normal group-velocity dispersion regime, pulse compression of the first dispersive wave results in the generation of a second dispersive wave, resulting in an octave-spanning supercontinuum generated primarily to one side of the pump spectrum. EOS We theoretically investigate the dynamics and show that the generated spectrum is highly coherent.	We experimentally confirm this dynamical behavior and the coherence properties in silicon nitride waveguides by performing direct detection of the carrier-envelope-offset frequency of our femtosecond pump source using an f-2f interferometer.
doc	Parallelization of the inverse fast multipole method with an application to boundary element method EOS We present an algorithm to parallelize the inverse fast multipole method (IFMM), which is an approximate direct solver for dense linear systems. EOS The parallel scheme is based on a greedy coloring algorithm, where two nodes in the hierarchy with the same color are separated by at least _EQN_ nodes. EOS We proved that when _EQN_, the workload associated with one color is embarrassingly parallel. EOS However, the number of nodes in a group (color) may be small when _EQN_. EOS Therefore, we also explored _EQN_, where a small fraction of the algorithm needs to be serialized, and the overall parallel efficiency was improved. EOS We implemented the parallel IFMM using OpenMP for shared-memory machines.	Successively, we applied it to a fast-multipole accelerated boundary element method (FMBEM) as a preconditioner, and compared its efficiency with (a) the original IFMM parallelized by linking a multi-threaded linear algebra library and (b) the commonly used parallel block-diagonal preconditioner.
doc	From Spline Approximation to Roth's Equation and Schur Functors EOS Alfeld and Schumaker provide a formula for the dimension of the space of piecewise polynomial functions, called splines, of degree _EQN_ and smoothness _EQN_ on a generic triangulation of a planar simplicial complex _EQN_, for _EQN_. EOS Schenck and Stiller conjectured that this formula actually holds for all _EQN_. EOS Up to this moment there was not known a single example where one could show that the bound _EQN_ is sharp. EOS However, in 2005, a possible such example was constructed to show that this bound is the best possible (i.e., the Alfeld-Schumaker formula does not hold if _EQN_), except that the proof that this formula actually works if _EQN_ has been a challenge until now when we finally show it to be true.	The interesting subtle connections with representation theory, matrix theory and commutative and homological algebra seem to explain why this example presented such a challenge.
doc	Towards Deductive Verification of Control Algorithms for Autonomous Marine Vehicles EOS The use of autonomous vehicles in real-world applications is often precluded by the difficulty of providing safety guarantees for their complex controllers. EOS The simulation-based testing of these controllers cannot deliver sufficient safety guarantees, and the use of formal verification is very challenging due to the hybrid nature of the autonomous vehicles.	Our work-in-progress paper introduces a formal verification approach that addresses this challenge by integrating the numerical computation of such a system (in GNU/Octave) with its hybrid system verification by means of a proof assistant (Isabelle).

doc	Linear programming and the intersection of free subgroups in free products of groups EOS We study the intersection of finitely generated factor-free subgroups of free products of groups by utilizing the method of linear programming. EOS For example, we prove that if _EQN_ is a finitely generated factor-free noncyclic subgroup of the free product _EQN_ of two finite groups _EQN_, _EQN_, then the WN-coefficient _EQN_ of _EQN_ is rational and can be computed in exponential time in the size of _EQN_.	This coefficient _EQN_ is the minimal positive real number such that, for every finitely generated factor-free subgroup _EQN_ of _EQN_, it is true that _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the reduced rank of _EQN_, _EQN_ is the rank of _EQN_, and _EQN_ is the reduced rank of the generalized intersection of _EQN_ and _EQN_.
doc	Rigidity of the \'Alvarez classes of Riemannian foliations with nilpotent structure Lie algebras	We show that if the structure algebra of a Riemannian foliation F on a closed manifold M is nilpotent, then the integral of the \'Alvarez class of (M,F) along every closed path is the exponential of an algebraic number.
doc	Accretion of phantom scalar field into a black hole EOS Using numerical methods we present the first full nonlinear study of phantom scalar field accreted into a black hole. EOS We study different initial configurations and find that the accretion of the field into the black hole can reduce its area down to 50 percent within time scales of the order of few masses of the initial horizon. EOS The analysis includes the cases where the total energy of the space-time is positive or negative.	The confirmation of this effect in full nonlinear general relativity implies that the accretion of exotic matter could be considered an evaporation process.

doc	On a digital quantum description of physical space versus the continuum description EOS The continuum of real numbers has served well as a model for physical space in mechanics and field theories. EOS However it is a well-motivated and popular idea that at the fundamental Planck scale the combination of gravitational and quantum effects forces us to re-evaluate the concept of space (and time), and some sort of discreteness or granularity is expected. EOS Here we study a cubic grid of points representing fundamental volumes of space and derive the spectra of momenta and wave number, which are not generally proportional to each other. EOS The momentum is bounded and discrete for a finite grid.	The uncertainty principle must be modified to reflect small scale spatial non-locality but it is consistent with the standard uncertainty principle in the continuum limit.
doc	Prescient Precoding in Heterogeneous DSA Networks with Both Underlay and Interweave MIMO Cognitive Radios EOS This work examines a novel heterogeneous dynamic spectrum access network where the primary users (PUs) coexist with both underlay and interweave cognitive radios (ICRs); EOS all terminals being potentially equipped with multiple antennas. EOS Underlay cognitive transmitters (UCTs) are allowed to transmit concurrently with PUs subject to interference constraints, while the ICRs employ spectrum sensing and are permitted to access the shared spectrum only when both PUs and UCTs are absent. EOS We investigate the design of MIMO precoding algorithms for the UCT that increase the detection probability at the ICRs, while simultaneously meeting a desired Quality-of-Service target to the underlay cognitive receivers (UCRs) and constraining interference leaked to PUs. EOS The objective of such a proactive approach, referred to as prescient precoding, is to minimize the probability of interference from ICRs to the UCRs and primary receivers due to imperfect spectrum sensing. EOS We begin with downlink prescient precoding algorithms for multiple single-antenna UCRs and multi-antenna PUs/ICRs.	We then present prescient block-diagonalization algorithms for the MIMO underlay downlink where spatial multiplexing is performed for a plurality of multi-antenna UCRs.

doc	Improved AGN light curve analysis with the z-transformed discrete correlation function EOS The cross-correlation function (CCF) is commonly employed in the study of AGN, where it is used to probe the structure of the broad line region by line reverberation, to study the continuum emission mechanism by correlating multi-waveband light curves and to seek correlations between the variability and other AGN properties. EOS The z -transformed discrete correlation function (ZDCF) is a new method for estimating the CCF of sparse, unevenly sampled light curves. EOS Unlike the commonly used interpolation method, it does not assume that the light curves are smooth and it does provide errors on its estimates. EOS The ZDCF corrects several biases of the discrete correlation function method of Edelson & Krolik (1988) by using equal population binning and Fisher's z -transform. EOS These lead to a more robust and powerful method of estimating the CCF of sparse light curves of as few as 12 points. EOS Two examples of light curve analysis with the ZDCF are presented. EOS 1) The ZDCF estimate of the auto-correlation function is used to uncover a correlation between AGN magnitude and variability time scale in a small simulated sample of very sparse and irregularly sampled light curves.	2) A maximum likelihood function for the ZDCF peak location is used to estimate the time-lag between two light curves.
doc	75 Years of the Wavefunction: Complex-Dynamical Extension of the Original Wave Realism and the Universal Schroedinger Equation EOS Following Max Planck's hypothesis of quanta (quant-ph/0012069) and the matter wave idea of Louis de Broglie (quant-ph/9911107), Erwin Schroedinger proposed, at the beginning of 1926, the concept of wavefunction and wave equation for it. EOS Though endowed with a realistic undular interpretation by its father, the wavefunction could not be considered as a real "matter wave" and has been provided with only abstract, formally probabilistic interpretation. EOS In this paper we show how the resulting "mysteries" of usual theory are solved within the unreduced, dynamically multivalued description of the underlying, essentially nonlinear interaction process (quant-ph/9902015, quant-ph/9902016), without artificial modification of the Schroedinger equation. EOS The latter is rigorously derived instead as universal expression of unreduced interaction complexity. EOS Causal, totally realistic wavefunction is obtained as a dynamically probabilistic intermediate state of a simple system with interaction performing dynamically discrete transitions between its localised, incompatible "realisations" ("corpuscular" states). EOS Causal wavefunction and Schroedinger equation are then extended to arbitrary level of world dynamics.	We outline some applications of the obtained causal description, such as genuine quantum chaos (quant-ph/9511034-36) and realistic quantum devices (physics/0211071), and emphasize the basic difference of the proposed dynamically multivalued theory from dynamically single-valued imitations of causality and complexity.

EOS Integrated macrocell/femtocell networks surely able to provide high data rate for the indoor users as well as able to offload huge traffic from the macrocellular networks to femtocellular networks. EOS Efficient handling of handover calls is the key for the successful macrocell/femtocell integration. EOS An appropriate traffic model for the integrated macrocell/femtocell networks is also needed for the performance analysis measurement.	In this paper we presented a call admission control process and a traffic model for the integrated macrocell/femtocell networks.

doc	On finite simple groups acting on homology spheres EOS It is a consequence of the classical Jordan bound for finite subgroups of linear groups that in each dimension n there are only finitely many finite simple groups which admit a faithful, linear action on the n-sphere.	In the present paper we prove an analogue for smooth actions on arbitrary homology n-spheres: in each dimension n there are only finitely many finite simple groups which admit a faithful, smooth action on some homology sphere of dimension n, and in particular on the n-sphere.
doc	Real-Time Systems Modeling and Analysis EOS This paper is a survey of extensions to finite automata theory to model real-time systems as well as systems exhibiting mixed discrete-continuous behavior. EOS Real-time systems maintain a continuous and timely interaction with the environment, often adhering to some timing constraints. EOS Therefore, the finite automata theory is extended to measure real-time values and accept or reject runs on a class of automata known as timed-automata, upon satisfying some timed properties. EOS The automata modeling the mixed discrete-continuous behavior of hybrid systems has its continuous-time dynamics described using ordinary differential equations for the state space and discrete-time dynamics describing the control decisions.	Based on these dynamical system models, we likewise extend the finite automata theory to describe the behavior of hybrid systems using Hybrid Automata.
doc	Coronal heating and emission mechanisms in AGN EOS Popular models for the formation of X-ray spectra in AGN assume that a large fraction of the disk's angular momentum dissipation takes place in a hot corona that carries a small amount of the accreting mass.

doc	Spin torque in a magnetic trilayer coupled to a superconductor EOS A ferromagnet-normal-metal-ferromagnet trilayer does not conserve spin current and as a result, the conduction electrons can create a torque on the magnetic moments. EOS When the trilayer is connected to a superconducting electrode, the spin torque created by a current flowing perpendicularly to the trilayer can drive the system to a configuration where the two magnetic moments are perpendicular to each other.	Here we argue that in contrast to the non-equilibrium torque, the equilibrium torque (or magnetic exchange interaction) does not single out the perpendicular configuration.
doc	Goldstone bosons in presence of charge density EOS We investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in Lorentz-noninvariant theories. EOS Our general discussion includes relativistic systems at finite density as well as intrinsically nonrelativistic systems. EOS The main result of the paper is a direct proof that nonzero density of a non-Abelian charge in the ground state implies the existence of a Goldstone boson with nonlinear (typically, quadratic) dispersion law. EOS We show that the Goldstone boson dispersion relation may in general be extracted from the current transition amplitude and demonstrate on examples from recent literature, how the calculation of the dispersion relation is utilized by this method. EOS After then, we use the general results to analyze the nonrelativistic degenerate Fermi gas of four fermion species.	Due to its internal SU(4) symmetry, this system provides an analog to relativistic two-color quantum chromodynamics with two quark flavors.

An anomalous total cross section is revealed at the specific quantized magnetic flux at low energy which helps explain the composite fermion and boson model in the fractional quantum Hall effect.

We represent the measurement of heat flow with Hermitian map superoperators that act on the system density matrix.

EOS We train a fast object category detector for instance detection on our data. EOS Using the dataset we show that, although increasingly accurate and fast, the state of the art for object detection is still severely impacted by object scale, occlusion, and viewing direction all of which matter for robotics applications.	We next validate the dataset for simulating active vision, and use the dataset to develop and evaluate a deep-network-based system for next best move prediction for object classification using reinforcement learning.
doc	Lambda_c^+/Lambda_c^- Asymmetry in Hadroproduction from Heavy-Quark Recombination EOS Asymmetries in the hadroproduction of charm particles directly probe power corrections to the QCD factorization theorems. EOS In this paper, the heavy-quark recombination mechanism, a power correction that explains charm meson asymmetries, is extended to charm baryons.	In this mechanism, a light quark participates in the hard scattering that creates a charm quark and they hadronize together into a charm baryon.

In this paper the local diffeomorphism classification is completed for generic directed curves.

In addition, we present invariant mass spectra of two particle subsystems.
doc	Dynamic Imaging of Au-nanoparticles via Scanning Electron Microscopy in a Graphene Wet Cell EOS High resolution nanoscale imaging in liquid environments is crucial for studying molecular interactions in biological and chemical systems. EOS In particular, electron microscopy is the gold-standard tool for nanoscale imaging, but its high-vacuum requirements make application to in-liquid samples extremely challenging. EOS Here we present a new graphene based wet cell device where high resolution SEM (scanning electron microscope) and Energy Dispersive X-rays (EDX) analysis can be performed directly inside a liquid environment. EOS Graphene is an ideal membrane material as its high transparancy, conductivity and mechanical strength can support the high vacuum and grounding requirements of a SEM while enabling maximal resolution and signal.	In particular, we obtain high resolution (< 5 nm) SEM video images of nanoparticles undergoing brownian motion inside the graphene wet cell and EDX analysis of nanoparticle composition in the liquid enviornment.
doc	Monte Carlo algorithm based on internal bridging moves for the atomistic simulation of thiophene oligomers and polymers EOS We introduce a powerful Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm for the atomistic simulation of bulk models of oligo- and poly-thiophenes by redesigning MC moves originally developed for considerably simpler polymer structures and architectures, such as linear and branched polyethylene, to account for the ring structure of the thiophene monomer. EOS Elementary MC moves implemented include bias reptation of an end thiophene ring, flip of an internal thiophene ring, rotation of an end thiophene ring, concerted rotation of three thiophene rings, rigid translation of an entire molecule, rotation of an entire molecule and volume fluctuation. EOS In the implementation of all moves we assume that thiophene ring atoms remain rigid and strictly co-planar; EOS on the other hand, inter-ring torsion and bond bending angles remain fully flexible subject to suitable potential energy functions.	Test simulations with the new algorithm of an important thiophene oligomer, \alpha -sexithiophene (\alpha -6T), at a high enough temperature (above its isotropic-to-nematic phase transition) using a new united atom model specifically developed for the purpose of this work provide predictions for the volumetric, conformational and structural properties that are remarkably close to those obtained from detailed atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations using an all-atom model.
doc	Planetary protection in the extreme environments of low-mass stars EOS Recent results showed that the magnetic field of M-dwarf (dM) stars, currently the main targets in searches for terrestrial planets, is very different from the solar one, both in topology as well as in intensity. EOS In particular, the magnetised environment surrounding a planet orbiting in the habitable zone (HZ) of dM stars can differ substantially to the one encountered around the Earth. EOS These extreme magnetic fields can compress planetary magnetospheres to such an extent that a significant fraction of the planet's atmosphere may be exposed to erosion by the stellar wind. EOS Using observed surface magnetic maps for a sample of 15 dM stars, we investigate the minimum degree of planetary magnetospheric compression caused by the intense stellar magnetic fields. EOS We show that hypothetical Earth-like planets with similar terrestrial magnetisation (~1G) orbiting at the inner (outer) edge of the HZ of these stars would present magnetospheres that extend at most up to 6.1 (11.7) planetary radii.	To be able to sustain an Earth-sized magnetosphere, the terrestrial planet would either need to orbit significantly farther out than the traditional limits of the HZ;
doc	Testing the Monte Carlo - Mean Field approximation in the one-band Hubbard model EOS The canonical one-band Hubbard model is studied using a computational method that mixes the Monte Carlo procedure with the mean field approximation. EOS This technique allows us to incorporate thermal fluctuations and the development of short-range magnetic order above ordering temperatures, contrary to the crude finite-temperature Hartree-Fock approximation, which incorrectly predicts a N\'eel temperature _EQN_ that grows linearly with the Hubbard _EQN_. EOS The effective model studied here contains quantum and classical degrees of freedom. EOS It thus belongs to the "spin fermion" model family widely employed in other contexts. EOS Using exact diagonalization, supplemented by the traveling cluster approximation, for the fermionic sector, and classical Monte Carlo for the classical fields, the Hubbard _EQN_ vs. EOS temperature _EQN_ phase diagram is studied employing large three and two dimensional clusters. EOS We demonstrate that the method is capable of capturing the formation of local moments in the normal state without long-range order, the non-monotonicity of _EQN_ with increasing _EQN_, the development of gaps and pseudogaps in the density of states, and the two-peak structure in the specific heat. EOS Extensive comparisons with determinant quantum Monte Carlo results suggest that the present approach is qualitatively, and often quantitatively, accurate, particularly at intermediate and high temperatures. EOS Finally, we study the Hubbard model including plaquette diagonal hopping (i.e.	the _EQN_ Hubbard model) in two dimensions and show that our approach allows us to study low temperature properties where determinant quantum Monte Carlo fails due to the fermion sign problem.
doc	On an Intensity-Ratio Equivalence for Two Top-Quark Decay Couplings EOS For the t --> W b decay mode, an intensity-ratio equivalence for two distinct Lorentz-invariant couplings is shown to be a consequence of symmetries of tWb-transformations. EOS Three explicit tWb-transformations connect the four standard model's (SM) helicity amplitudes and the amplitudes in the case of an additional chiral-tensorial-coupling of relative strength 53 GeV. EOS Such a coupling will arise if there is a large t_R --> b_L chiral weak-transition-moment.	Two commutator plus anti-commutator symmetry algebras are generated from the 3 transformation matrices.
doc	Non-extensive statistics and its effects on cosmology EOS Non-extensive statistics, namely Tsallis statistics, is applied on a case of a supercritical string cosmology and interesting cosmological modifications are obtained.

doc	Hybrid Integrated Photonics Using Bulk Acoustic Resonators EOS Microwave frequency acousto-optic modulation is realized by exciting high overtone bulk acoustic wave resonances (HBAR resonances) in the photonic stack. EOS These confined mechanical stress waves transmit exhibit vertically transmitting, high quality factor (Q) acoustic Fabry Perot resonances that extend into the Gigahertz domain, and offer stress-optical interaction with the optical modes of the microresonator. EOS Although HBAR are ubiquitously used in modern communication, and often exploited in superconducting circuits, this is the first time they have been incorporated on a photonic circuit based chip. EOS The electro-acousto-optical interaction observed within the optical modes exhibits high actuation linearity, low actuation power and negligible crosstalk. EOS Using the electro-acousto-optic interaction, fast optical resonance tuning is achieved with sub-nanosecond transduction time. EOS By removing the silicon backreflection, broadband acoustic modulation at 4.1 and 8.7 GHz is realized with a 3 dB bandwidth of 250 MHz each.	The novel hybrid HBAR nanophotonic platform demonstrated here, allowing on chip integration of micron-scale acoustic and photonic resonators, can find immediate applications in tunable microwave photonics, high bandwidth soliton microcomb stabilization, compact opto-electronic oscillators, and in microwave to optical conversion schemes.

EOS Bulk trigonal Te has been theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated to be an outstanding thermoelectric material with high value of thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT. EOS In view of the recent progress in developing synthesis route of two-dimensional (2D) tellurium thin films as well as the growing trend of exploiting nanostructures as thermoelectric devices, here for the first time we report excellent thermoelectric performance of tellurium nanofilms, with room temperature power factor of 31.7 \mu Wcm-1K-2 and ZT value of 0.63.	To further enhance the efficiency of harvesting thermoelectric power in nanofilm devices, thermoelectrical current mapping was performed with a laser as a heating source, and we found high work function metals such as palladium can form rare accumulation-type metal-to-semiconductor contacts to 2D Te, which allows thermoelectrically generated carriers to be collected more efficiently.

doc	Blind Detection of Polar Codes EOS Polar codes were recently chosen to protect the control channel information in the next-generation mobile communication standard (5G) defined by the 3GPP. EOS As a result, receivers will have to implement blind detection of polar coded frames in order to keep complexity, latency, and power consumption tractable. EOS As a newly proposed class of block codes, the problem of polar-code blind detection has received very little attention. EOS In this work, we propose a low-complexity blind-detection algorithm for polar-encoded frames. EOS We base this algorithm on a novel detection metric with update rules that leverage the a priori knowledge of the frozen-bit locations, exploiting the inherent structures that these locations impose on a polar-encoded block of data.	We show that the proposed detection metric allows to clearly distinguish polar-encoded frames from other types of data by considering the cumulative distribution functions of the detection metric, and the receiver operating characteristic.
doc	A Sequential Subspace Method for Millimeter Wave MIMO Channel Estimation EOS Data transmission over the mmWave in fifth-generation wireless networks aims to support very high speed wireless communications. EOS A substantial increase in spectrum efficiency for mmWave transmission can be achieved by using advanced hybrid precoding, for which accurate channel state information is the key. EOS Rather than estimating the entire channel matrix, directly estimating subspace information, which contains fewer parameters, does have enough information to design transceivers. EOS However, the large channel use overhead and associated computational complexity in the existing channel subspace estimation techniques are major obstacles to deploy the subspace approach for channel estimation. EOS In this paper, we propose a sequential two-stage subspace estimation method that can resolve the overhead issues and provide accurate subspace information. EOS Utilizing a sequential method enables us to avoid manipulating the entire high-dimensional training signal, which greatly reduces the complexity. EOS Specifically, in the first stage, the proposed method samples the columns of channel matrix to estimate its column subspace. EOS Then, based on the obtained column subspace, it optimizes the training signals to estimate the row subspace. EOS For a channel with _EQN_ receive antennas and _EQN_ transmit antennas, our analysis shows that the proposed technique only requires _EQN_ channel uses, while providing a guarantee of subspace estimation accuracy.	By theoretical analysis, it is shown that the similarity between the estimated subspace and the true subspace is linearly related to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), i.e., _EQN_, at high SNR, while quadratically related to the SNR, i.e., _EQN_, at low SNR.
doc	Universal Critical Behavior of Noisy Coupled Oscillators EOS We study the universal thermodynamic properties of systems consisting of many coupled oscillators operating in the vicinity of a homogeneous oscillating instability.

doc	The Effects of Skin Lesion Segmentation on the Performance of Dermatoscopic Image Classification EOS Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the deadliest types of skin cancer. EOS Analysing dermatoscopic images plays an important role in the early detection of MM and other pigmented skin lesions. EOS Among different computer-based methods, deep learning-based approaches and in particular convolutional neural networks have shown excellent classification and segmentation performances for dermatoscopic skin lesion images. EOS These models can be trained end-to-end without requiring any hand-crafted features. EOS However, the effect of using lesion segmentation information on classification performance has remained an open question. EOS In this study, we explicitly investigated the impact of using skin lesion segmentation masks on the performance of dermatoscopic image classification. EOS To do this, first, we developed a baseline classifier as the reference model without using any segmentation masks. EOS Then, we used either manually or automatically created segmentation masks in both training and test phases in different scenarios and investigated the classification performances. EOS Evaluated on the ISIC 2017 challenge dataset which contained two binary classification tasks (i.e. EOS MM vs. EOS all and seborrheic keratosis (SK) vs.	all) and based on the derived area under the receiver operating characteristic curve scores, we observed four main outcomes.
doc	Beyond the upper limit of magnetic anisotropy in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides EOS Exploring an upper limit of magnetic anisotropy in two-dimensional materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, is at the heart of spintronics research.	Herein, an atomic-scale perpendicular magnetic anisotropy up to an order of 100 meV per atom, which is far beyond the ordinarily obtained value in graphene and pristine transition metal dichalcogenides, is demonstrated in individual ruthenium and osmium adatoms at a monosulfur vacancy in molybdenum disulfide.

The LSP is assumed to be the lightest neutralino and stable.

doc	Higher Chern classes in Iwasawa theory EOS We begin a study of m-th Chern classes and m-th characteristic symbols for Iwasawa modules which are supported in codimension at least m. EOS This extends the classical theory of characteristic ideals and their generators for Iwasawa modules which are torsion, i.e., supported in codimension at least 1.	We apply this to an Iwasawa module constructed from an inverse limit of p-parts of ideal class groups of abelian extensions of an imaginary quadratic field.
doc	On a Localized Riemannian Penrose Inequality EOS Consider a compact, orientable, three dimensional Riemannian manifold with boundary with nonnegative scalar curvature. EOS Suppose its boundary is the disjoint union of two pieces: the horizon boundary and the outer boundary, where the horizon boundary consists of the unique closed minimal surfaces in the manifold and the outer boundary is metrically a round sphere. EOS We obtain an inequality relating the area of the horizon boundary to the area and the total mean curvature of the outer boundary.	Such a manifold may be thought as a region, surrounding the outermost apparent horizons of black holes, in a time-symmetric slice of a space-time in the context of general relativity.

doc	Axisymmetric Magnetorotational Instability in Viscous Accretion Disks EOS Axisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) in viscous accretion disks is investigated by linear analysis and two-dimensional nonlinear simulations. EOS The linear growth of the viscous MRI is characterized by the Reynolds number defined as _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the Alfv \'e n velocity, _EQN_ is the kinematic viscosity, and _EQN_ is the angular velocity of the disk. EOS Although the linear growth rate is suppressed considerably as the Reynolds number decreases, the nonlinear behavior is found to be almost independent of _EQN_. EOS At the nonlinear evolutionary stage, a two-channel flow continues growing and the Maxwell stress increases until the end of calculations even though the Reynolds number is much smaller than unity. EOS A large portion of the injected energy to the system is converted to the magnetic energy. EOS The gain rate of the thermal energy, on the other hand, is found to be much larger than the viscous heating rate.	Nonlinear behavior of the MRI in the viscous regime and its difference from that in the highly resistive regime can be explained schematically by using the characteristics of the linear dispersion relation.
doc	Relativistic Studies of Close Neutron Star Binaries EOS We discuss (3+1) dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of close neutron star binary systems. EOS The relativistic field equations are solved at each time slice with a spatial 3-metric chosen to be conformally flat. EOS Against this solution the hydrodynamic variables and gravitational radiation are allowed to respond. EOS We have studied four physical processes which occur as the stars approach merger. EOS These include: 1) the relaxation to a hydrodynamic state of almost no spin; EOS 2) relativistically driven compression, heating, and neutrino emission; EOS 3) collapse to two black holes; EOS and 4) orbit inspiral occurring at a lower frequency than previously expected.	We give a brief account of the physical origin of these effects and an explanation of why they do not appear in models based upon, 1PN hydrodynamics, a weak field multipole expansion, a tidal analysis, or a rigidly corotating velocity field.
doc	Repulsive baryonic interactions and lattice QCD observables at imaginary chemical potential EOS The first principle lattice QCD methods allow to calculate the thermodynamic observables at finite temperature and imaginary chemical potential. EOS These can be compared to the predictions of various phenomenological models. EOS We argue that Fourier coefficients with respect to imaginary baryochemical potential are sensitive to modeling of baryonic interactions. EOS As a first application of this sensitivity, we consider the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model with repulsive baryonic interactions, which are modeled by means of the excluded volume correction.	The Fourier coefficients of the imaginary part of the net-baryon density at imaginary baryochemical potential -- corresponding to the fugacity or virial expansion at real chemical potential -- are calculated within this model, and compared with the _EQN_ lattice data.
doc	Emergent spacetime from modular motives EOS The program of constructing spacetime geometry from string theoretic modular forms is extended to Calabi-Yau varieties of dimensions two, three, and four, as well as higher rank motives. EOS Modular forms on the worldsheet can be constructed from the geometry of spacetime by computing the L-functions associated to omega motives of Calabi-Yau varieties, generated by their holomorphic _EQN_ forms via Galois representations. EOS The modular forms that emerge from the omega motive and other motives of the intermediate cohomology are related to characters of the underlying rational conformal field theory.	The converse problem of constructing space from string theory proceeds in the class of diagonal theories by determining the motives associated to modular forms in the category of motives with complex multiplication.
doc	Dynamical Study of a Second Order DPCM Transmission System Modeled by a Piece-Wise Linear Function EOS This paper analyses the behaviour of a second order DPCM (Differential Pulse Code Modulation) transmission system when the nonlinear characteristic of the quantizer is taken into consideration. EOS In this way, qualitatively new properties of the DPCM system have been unravelled, which cannot be observed and explained if the nonlinearity of the quantizer is neglected. EOS For the purposes of this study, a piece-wise linear nondifferentiable quantizer characteristic is considered. EOS The resulting model of the DPCM is of the form of iteration equations (i.e. EOS map), where the inverse iterate is not unique (i.e. EOS noninvertible map). EOS Therefore the mathematical theory of noninvertible maps is particularly suitable for this analysis, together with the more classic tools of Non Linear Dynamics. EOS This study allowed us in addition to show from a theoretical point of view some new properties of nondifferentiable maps, in comparison with differentiable ones. EOS After a short review of noninvertible maps, the presented methods and tools for noninvertible maps are applied to the DPCM system. EOS An original algorithm for calculation of bifurcation curves for the DPCM map is proposed.	Via the studies in the parameter and phase plane, different nonlinear phenomena such as the overlapping of bifurcation curves causing multistability, chaotic behaviour, or multiple basins with fractal boundary are pointed out.
doc	Simulation of two-flavors symmetry-locking phases in ultracold fermionic mixtures EOS We describe an ultracold fermionic set-up where it is possible to synthesize a superfluid phase with symmetry obtained by locking independent invariance groups of the normal state.

doc	Multiplex Modeling of the Society EOS The society has a multi-layered structure, where the layers represent the different contexts. EOS To model this structure we begin with a single-layer weighted social network (WSN) model showing the Granovetterian structure. EOS We find that when merging such WSN models, a sufficient amount of inter-layer correlation is needed to maintain the relationship between topology and link weights, while these correlations destroy the enhancement in the community overlap due to multiple layers. EOS To resolve this, we devise a geographic multi-layer WSN model, where the indirect inter-layer correlations due to the geographic constraints of individuals enhance the overlaps between the communities and, at the same time, the Granovetterian structure is preserved. EOS Furthermore, the network of social interactions can be considered as a multiplex from another point of view too: each layer corresponds to one communication channel and the aggregate of all them constitutes the entire social network. EOS However, usually one has information only about one of the channels, which should be considered as a sample of the whole. EOS Here we show by simulations and analytical methods that this sampling may lead to bias.	For example, while it is expected that the degree distribution of the whole social network has a maximum at a value larger than one, we get with reasonable assumptions about the sampling process a monotonously decreasing distribution as observed in empirical studies of single channel data.
doc	Spatiotemporal algebraically localized waveforms for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger model with gain and loss EOS We consider the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of a nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) model incorporating linear and nonlinear gain/loss. EOS First, we describe analytically the dynamical regimes (depending on the gain/loss strengths), for finite-time collapse, decay, and global existence of solutions in the dynamics. EOS Then, for all the above parametric regimes, we use direct numerical simulations to study the dynamics corresponding to algebraically decaying initial data. EOS We identify crucial differences between the dynamics of vanishing initial conditions, and those converging to a finite constant background: in the former (latter) case we find strong (weak) collapse or decay, when the gain/loss parameters are selected from the relevant regimes. EOS One of our main results, is that in all the above regimes, non-vanishing initial data transition through spatiotemporal, algebraically decaying waveforms.	While the system is nonintegrable, the evolution of these waveforms is reminiscent to the evolution of the Peregrine rogue wave of the integrable NLS limit.
doc	Temperature dependence of the light yield of the LAB-based and mesitylene-based liquid scintillators EOS We studied the temperature dependence of the light yield of the linear alkyl benzene (LAB)-based and mesitylene-based liquid scintillators. EOS The light yield increases by 23% for both liquid scintillators when the temperature is lowered from _EQN_ C to _EQN_ C, correcting for the temperature response of the photomultiplier tube. EOS The measurements help to understand the energy response of the liquid scintillator detectors.	Especially, the next generation reactor neutrino experiments for neutrino mass hierarchy, such as the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), require very high energy resolution.
doc	Quantum Speedup Based on Classical Decision Trees EOS Lin and Lin have recently shown how starting with a classical query algorithm (decision tree) for a function, we may find upper bounds on its quantum query complexity. EOS More precisely, they have shown that given a decision tree for a function _EQN_ whose input can be accessed via queries to its bits, and a guessing algorithm that predicts answers to the queries, there is a quantum query algorithm for _EQN_ which makes at most _EQN_ quantum queries where _EQN_ is the depth of the decision tree and _EQN_ is the maximum number of mistakes of the guessing algorithm. EOS In this paper we give a simple proof of and generalize this result for functions _EQN_ with non-binary input as well as output alphabets. EOS Our main tool for this generalization is non-binary span program which has recently been developed for non-binary functions, and the dual adversary bound. EOS As applications of our main result we present several quantum query upper bounds, some of which are new.	In particular, we show that topological sorting of vertices of a directed graph _EQN_ can be done with _EQN_ quantum queries in the adjacency matrix model.

doc	Noise effects and tomography of remote entangled spins in quantum dots EOS We investigate how decoherence affects the entanglement established between two quantum dots in micro cavities, and propose a tomographic scheme able to measure the entangled state. EOS The scheme we consider establishes the entanglement via the exchange and measurement of a photon. EOS Making the realistic assumption of noise dominated by pure-dephasing processes, we find that the photon must be exchanged and measured on timescales shorter than the quantum dots' characteristic dephasing time for appreciable levels of entanglement to be achieved.	The tomographic scheme is able to reconstruct the full density matrix of the quantum dots, and requires only single spin rotations and the injection of an additional photon.

doc	Metrics of nonpositive curvature on graph-manifolds and electromagnetic fields on graphs EOS A 3-dimensional graph-manifold is composed from simple blocks which are products of compact surfaces with boundary by the circle. EOS Its global structure may be as complicated as one likes and is described by a graph which might be an arbitrary graph. EOS A metric of nonpositive curvature on such a manifold, if it exists, can be described essentially by a finite number of parameters which satisfy a geometrization equation. EOS The aim of the work is to show that this equation is a discrete version of the Maxwell equations of classical electrodynamics, and its solutions, i.e., metrics of nonpositive curvature, are critical configurations of the same sort of action which describes the interaction of an electromagnetic field with a scalar charged field.	We establish this analogy in the framework of the spectral calculus (noncommutative geometry) of A.

doc	Introducing a hybrid model of DEA and data mining in evaluating efficiency. Case study: Bank Branches EOS The banking industry is very important for an economic cycle of each country and provides some quality of services for us. EOS With the advancement in technology and rapidly increasing of the complexity of the business environment, it has become more competitive than the past so that efficiency analysis in the banking industry attracts much attention in recent years. EOS From many aspects, such analyses at the branch level are more desirable. EOS Evaluating the branch performance with the purpose of eliminating deficiency can be a crucial issue for branch managers to measure branch efficiency. EOS This work not only can lead to a better understanding of bank branch performance but also give further information to enhance managerial decisions to recognize problematic areas. EOS To achieve this purpose, this study presents an integrated approach based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Clustering algorithms and Polynomial Pattern Classifier for constructing a classifier to identify a class of bank branches. EOS First, the efficiency estimates of individual branches are evaluated by using the DEA approach. EOS Next, when the range and number of classes were identified by experts, the number of clusters is identified by an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm based on some statistical methods.	Next, we divide our raw data into k clusters By means of self-organizing map (SOM) neural networks.
doc	Hidden Markov Nonlinear ICA: Unsupervised Learning from Nonstationary Time Series EOS Recent advances in nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (ICA) provide a principled framework for unsupervised feature learning and disentanglement. EOS The central idea in such works is that the latent components are assumed to be independent conditional on some observed auxiliary variables, such as the time-segment index. EOS This requires manual segmentation of data into non-stationary segments which is computationally expensive, inaccurate and often impossible. EOS These models are thus not fully unsupervised. EOS We remedy these limitations by combining nonlinear ICA with a Hidden Markov Model, resulting in a model where a latent state acts in place of the observed segment-index. EOS We prove identifiability of the proposed model for a general mixing nonlinearity, such as a neural network.	We also show how maximum likelihood estimation of the model can be done using the expectation-maximization algorithm.

EOS In more details, we provide a new algorithm for the problem of universal gathering mobile oblivious robots (that is, starting from any initial configuration that is not bivalent, using any number of robots, the robots reach in a finite number of steps the same position, not known beforehand) without relying on a common orientation nor chirality.	We give very strong guaranties on the correctness of our algorithm by proving formally that it is correct, using the COQ proof assistant.
doc	String Theory and the Path to Unification: A Review of Recent Developments EOS This is a pedagogical review article surveying the various approaches towards understanding gauge coupling unification within string theory. EOS As is well known, one of the major problems confronting string phenomenology has been an apparent discrepancy between the scale of gauge coupling unification predicted within string theory, and the unification scale expected within the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). EOS In this article, I provide an overview of the different approaches that have been taken in recent years towards reconciling these two scales, and outline some of the major recent developments in each. EOS These approaches include 1) string GUT models; EOS 2) higher affine levels and non-standard hypercharge normalizations; EOS 3) heavy string threshold corrections; EOS 4) light supersymmetric thresholds; EOS 5) effects from intermediate-scale gauge and matter structure beyond the MSSM;	6) strings without supersymmetry;

doc	Remarks on the Minimizing Geodesic Problem in Inviscid Incompressible Fluid Mechanics EOS We consider _EQN_ minimizing geodesics along the group of volume preserving maps _EQN_ of a given 3-dimensional domain _EQN_. EOS The corresponding curves describe the motion of an ideal incompressible fluid inside _EQN_ and are (formally) solutions of the Euler equations. EOS It is known that there is a unique possible pressure gradient for these curves whenever their end points are fixed. EOS In addition, this pressure field has a limited but unconditional (internal) regularity.	The present paper completes these results by showing: 1) the uniqueness property can be viewed as an infinite dimensional phenomenon (related to the possibility of relaxing the corresponding minimization problem by convex optimization), which is false for finite dimensional configuration spaces such as O(3) for the motion of rigid bodies;
doc	A Hermite-Pad\'e perspective on Gell-Mann--Low renormalization group: an application to the correlation function of Lieb-Liniger gas EOS While Pad\'e approximation is a general method for improving convergence of series expansions, Gell-Mann--Low renormalization group normally relies on the presence of special symmetries. EOS We show that in the single-variable case, the latter becomes an integral Hermite-Pad\'e approximation, needing no special symmetries. EOS It is especially useful for interpolating between expansions for small values of a variable and a scaling law of known exponent for large values.	As an example, we extract the scaling-law prefactor for the one-body density matrix of the Lieb-Liniger gas.
doc	Quark-antiquark potential in the analytic approach to QCD EOS The quark-antiquark potential is constructed by making use of a new analytic running coupling in QCD. EOS This running coupling arises under ``analytization'' of the renormalization group equation. EOS The rising behavior of the quark-antiquark potential at large distances, which provides the quark confinement, is shown explicitly.	At small distances, the standard behavior of this potential originating in the QCD asymptotic freedom is revealed.
doc	Effect of gravitational radiation reaction on nonequatorial orbits around a Kerr black hole EOS The effect of gravitational radiation reaction on orbits around a spinning black hole is analyzed. EOS Such orbits possess three constants of motion: _EQN_, _EQN_, and _EQN_, which correspond, in the Newtonian limit of the orbit being an ellipse, to the inclination angle of the orbital plane to the hole's equatorial plane, the eccentricity, and the semi-major axis length, respectively. EOS First, it is argued that circular orbits (_EQN_) remain circular under gravitational radiation reaction.	Second, for elliptical orbits (removing the restriction of _EQN_), the evolution of _EQN_, _EQN_, and _EQN_ is computed to leading order in _EQN_ (the magnitude of the spin angular momentum of the hole) and in _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the mass of the black hole.
doc	A Survey of Representation Stability Theory EOS In this survey article we summarize the current state of research in representation stability theory. EOS We look at three different, yet related, approaches, using (1) the category of FI-modules, (2) Schur-Weyl duality, and (3) finitely-generated modules over certain infinite dimensional vector spaces.	The main example is the stability of representations of the symmetric group, though there have also been some notable generalizations of representation stability to other groups.
doc	Gravity and Mirror Gravity in Plebanski Formulation EOS We present several theories of four-dimensional gravity in the Plebanski formulation, in which the tetrads and the connections are the independent dynamical variables. EOS We consider the relation between different versions of gravitational theories: Einstenian, dual, 'mirror' gravities and gravity with torsion. EOS According to Plebanski's assumption, our world, in which we live, is described by the self-dual left-handed gravity. EOS We propose that if the Mirror World exists in Nature, then the 'mirror gravity' is the right-handed anti-self-dual gravity with broken mirror parity. EOS Considering a special version of the Riemann--Cartan space-time, which has torsion as additional geometric property, we have shown that in the Plebanski formulation the ordinary and dual sectors of gravity, as well as the gravity with torsion, are equivalent.	In this context, we have also developed a 'pure connection gravity' -- a diffeomorphism-invariant gauge theory of gravity.
doc	Black Hole Thermodynamics and Massive Gravity EOS We consider the generalized laws of thermodynamics in massive gravity. EOS Making use of explicit black hole solutions, we devise black hole merger processes in which i) total entropy of the system decreases ii) the zero-temperature extremal black hole is created. EOS Thus, both second and third laws of thermodynamics are violated. EOS In both cases, the violation can be traced back to the presence of negative-mass black holes, which, in turn, is related to the violation of the null energy condition.	The violation of the third law of thermodynamics implies, in particular, that a naked singularity may be created as a result of the evolution of a singularity-free state.
doc	The SLoWPoKES Catalog of Low-mass Ultra-wide Binaries: A Cool Stars Resource for Testing Fundamental Properties and for Constraining Binary Formation Theory EOS We present results from the Sloan Low-mass Wide Pairs of Kinematically Equivalent Stars (SLoWPoKES) catalog of ultra-wide (10^3-10^5.5 AU), low-mass (K5-M7) common proper motion binaries. EOS We constructed a Galactic model, based on empirical stellar number density and 3D velocity distributions, to select bona fide pairs with probability of chance alignment <5%, making SLoWPoKES an efficient sample for followup observations. EOS Our initial catalog contains 1342 disk dwarf, subdwarf, and white dwarf-red dwarf systems and is the largest collection of low-mass, wide binaries ever assembled. EOS The diversity---in mass, metallicity, age, and evolutionary states---of SLoWPoKES pairs makes it a valuable resource of coeval laboratories to examine and constrain the physical properties of low-mass stars. EOS SLoWPoKES pairs show signatures of two (or more) formation modes in the distribution of the physical separation and higher-order multiplicity. EOS Neither dynamical dissipation of primordial triples/quadruples or dynamical capture of ejected stars can explain the observed populations by itself. EOS We use followup spectroscopic observations to recalibrate the metallicity-sensitive \zeta _(TiO/CaH) index by assuming that both members of the binary system have the same composition.	Our new formulation is a significantly better tracer of absolute metallicity, particularly for the early-type M dwarfs.
doc	On an asymptotic estimate of the _EQN_ -loop correction in perturbative QCD EOS A recently proposed method of estimating the asymptotic behaviour of QCD perturbation theory coefficients is critically reviewed and shown to contain numerous invalid mathematical operations and unsubstantiated assumptions.	We discuss in detail why this procedure, based solely on renormalization group (RG) considerations and analyticity constraints, cannot lead to such estimates.
doc	Mass and mixing of fermions from a rotating mass matrix EOS We summarize the results showing that all existing data on mixing between up and down fermion states (i.e.	CKM matrix and neutrino oscillations) and on the hierarchical quark and lepton mass ratios between generations are consistent with the two phenomena being both consequences of a mass matrix rotating in generation space with changing energy scale.

doc	Relativistic Landau-He-McKellar-Wilkens quantization and relativistic bound states solutions for a Coulomb-like potential induced by the Lorentz symmetry breaking effects EOS In this work, we discuss the relativistic Landau-He-McKellar-Wilkens quantization and relativistic bound states solutions for a Dirac neutral particle under the influence of a Coulomb-like potential induced by the Lorentz symmetry breaking effects.	We present new possible scenarios of studying Lorentz symmetry breaking effects by fixing the space-like vector field background in special configurations.
doc	Fermi Surface Evolution in an Electron-Doped High-Tc Superconductor Revealed by Magnetic Quantum Oscillations EOS We report on the direct probing of the Fermi surface in the bulk of the electron-doped superconductor Nd _EQN_ Ce _EQN_ CuO _EQN_ at different doping levels by means of magnetoresistance quantum oscillations.	Our data reveal a sharp qualitative change in the Fermi surface topology, due to translational symmetry breaking in the electronic system which occurs at a critical doping level significantly exceeding the optimal doping.
doc	Weak Measurement and (Bohmian) Conditional Wave Functions EOS It was recently pointed out (and demonstrated experimentally) by Lundeen et al that the wave function of a particle (more precisely, the wave function possessed by each member of an ensemble of identically-prepared particles) can be "directly measured" using weak measurement. EOS Here it is shown that if this same technique is applied, with appropriate post-selection, to one particle from a (perhaps entangled) multi-particle system, the result is precisely the so-called "conditional wave function" of Bohmian mechanics. EOS Thus, a plausibly operationalist method for defining the wave function of a quantum mechanical sub-system corresponds to the natural definition of a sub-system wave function which Bohmian mechanics (uniquely) makes possible.	Similarly, a weak-measurement-based procedure for directly measuring a sub-system's density matrix should yield, under appropriate circumstances, the Bohmian "conditional density matrix" as opposed to the standard reduced density matrix.
doc	Supersymmetry and LHC Missing Energy Signals EOS Current analyses of the LHC data put stringent bounds on strongly interacting supersymmetric particles, restricting the masses of squarks and gluinos to be above the TeV scale. EOS However, the supersymmetric electroweak sector is poorly constrained. EOS In this article we explore the consistency of possible LHC missing energy signals with the broader phenomenological structure of the electroweak sector in low energy supersymmetry models. EOS As an example, we focus on the newly developed Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction analysis by ATLAS, which reports interesting event excesses in channels containing di-lepton and tri-lepton final states plus missing energy.	We show that it is not difficult to obtain compatibility of these LHC data with the observed dark matter relic density, the bounds from dark matter direct detection experiments, and the measured anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.
doc	Hermitian _EQN_ -modules and Saito's "higher residue pairings" EOS Following the work of Daniel Barlet ([Bar97]) and Ridha Belgrade ([Bel01]) the aim of this article is the study of the existence of _EQN_ -hermitian forms on regular _EQN_ -modules. EOS We show that every regular _EQN_ -module with a non-degenerate bilinear form can be written in an unique way as a direct sum of _EQN_ -modules _EQN_ that admit either an _EQN_ -hermitian or an _EQN_ -anti-hermitian form or both; EOS all three cases are equally possible with explicit examples.	As an application we extend the result in [Bel01] on the existence for all _EQN_ -modules _EQN_ associated with the Brieskorn module of a holomorphic function with an isolated singularity, of an _EQN_ -bilinear non degenerate form on _EQN_.
doc	Nonprobabilistic teleportation of field state via cavity QED EOS In this article we discuss a teleportation scheme of coherent states of cavity field. EOS The experimental realization proposed makes use of cavity quatum electrodynamics involving the interaction of Rydberg atoms with micromaser and Ramsey cavities.	In our scheme the Ramsey cavities and the atoms play the role of auxiliary systems used to teleport the state from a micromaser cavity to another.

doc	Formation of fragments in heavy-ion collisions using modified clusterization method EOS We study the formation of fragments by extending the minimum spanning tree method (MST) for clusterization. EOS In this extension, each fragment is subjected to a binding-energy check calculated using the modified Bethe-Weizsacker formula. EOS Earlier, a constant binding-energy cut of 4 MeV/nucleon was imposed.	Our results for 197Au +197 Au collisions are compared with ALADiN data and also with the calculations based on the simulated annealing technique.
doc	Improved quark mass density- dependent model with quark and non-linear scalar field coupling EOS The improved quark mass density- dependent model which includes the coupling between the quarks and a non-linear scalar field is presented. EOS Numerical analysis of solutions of the model is performed over a wide range of parameters. EOS The wave functions of ground state and the lowest one-particle excited states with even and odd parity are given.	The root-mean squared radius, the magnetic moment and the ratio between the axial-vector and the vector beta-decay coupling constants of the nucleon are calculated.
doc	Composite flavor-singlet scalar in twelve-flavor QCD EOS We report the calculation of the flavor-singlet scalar in the SU(3) gauge theory with the degenerate twelve fermions in the fundamental representation using a HISQ-type action at a fixed _EQN_. EOS In order to reduce the large statistical error coming from the vacuum-subtracted disconnected correlator, we employ a noise reduction method and a large number of configurations.	We observe that the flavor-singlet scalar is lighter than the pion in this theory from the calculations with the fermion bilinear and gluonic operators.
doc	Goldstone mode stochastization in quantum Hall ferromagnet EOS Experimental and theoretical studies of the coherent spin dynamics of two-dimensional GaAs/AlGaAs electron gas were performed. EOS The system in the quantum Hall ferromagnet state exhibits a spin relaxation mechanism that is determined by many-particle Coulomb interactions.	In addition to the spin exciton with changes in the spin quantum numbers of _EQN_, the quantum Hall ferromagnet supports a Goldstone spin exciton that changes the spin quantum numbers to _EQN_ and _EQN_, which corresponds to a coherent spin rotation of the entire electron system to a certain angle.
doc	De-singularization by rotation	We consider certain BPS supergravity solutions of string theory which have singularities and we show that the singularity goes away when we add angular momentum.
doc	Numerical solution of the color superconductivity gap in a weak coupling constant EOS We present the numerical solution of the full gap equation in a weak coupling constant _EQN_. EOS It is found that the standard approximations to derive the gap equation to the leading order of coupling constant are essential for a secure numerical evaluation of the logarithmic singularity with a small coupling constant. EOS The approximate integral gap equation with a very small _EQN_ should be inverted to a soft integral equation to smooth the logarithmic singularity near the Fermi surface. EOS The full gap equation is solved for a rather large coupling constant _EQN_. EOS The approximate and soft integral gap equations are solved for small _EQN_ values. EOS When their solutions are extrapolated to larger _EQN_ values, they coincide the full gap equation solution near the Fermi surface. EOS Furthermore, the analytical solution matches the numerical one up to the order one O(1).	Our results confirm the previous estimates that the gap energy is of the order tens to 100 MeV for the chemical potential _EQN_ MeV.
doc	Drop freezing: fine detection of contaminants by measuring the tip angle EOS In this Letter, we show that the shape of a freezing drop of water can be sensitive to the presence of impurities. EOS We measure the tip angle of water drops frozen on a cold plate.	The fine changes in tip angle are robustly captured by our image analysis method, which shows a deviation from that of pure water in solutions with salt (NaCl), polymer (PEG) and surfactant (TTAB) starting at concentrations of _EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_ M respectively.

In this context, we have also developed a 'pure connection gravity' -- a diffeomorphism-invariant gauge theory of gravity.
doc	Production asymmetry of D mesons in _EQN_ collisions EOS We study the production asymmetry of charm versus anticharm mesons in photon-proton interactions.	We consider photon gluon fusion plus higher order corrections in which light quarks through vector meson-proton interactions contribute to the cross section.
doc	Dark sectors and enhanced _EQN_ transitions EOS LHC searches with _EQN_ leptons in the final state are always inclusive in missing-energy sources. EOS A signal in the flavor-violating Higgs decay search, _EQN_, could therefore equally well be due to a flavor conserving decay, but with an extended decay topology with additional invisible particles. EOS We demonstrate this with the three-body decay _EQN_, where _EQN_ is a flavorful mediator decaying to a dark-sector.	This scenario can give thermal relic dark matter that carries lepton flavor charges, a realistic structure of the charged lepton masses, and explain the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, _EQN_, while simultaneously obey all indirect constraints from flavor-changing neutral currents.
doc	Soft triple-real radiation for Higgs production at N3LO EOS We present the two first terms in the threshold expansion of Higgs production partonic cross-sections at hadron colliders for processes with three partons in the final state. EOS These are contributions to the inclusive Higgs cross-section in gluon fusion at N3LO. EOS We have developed a new technique for the expansion of the squared matrix-elements around the soft limit and for the reduction of the required phase-space integrals to only ten single-scale master integrals.	We compute the master integrals building upon modern techniques for the integration of multidimensional integrals in dimensional regularization.
doc	Playing with parameters: structural parameterization in graphs EOS When considering a graph problem from a parameterized point of view, the parameter chosen is often the size of an optimal solution of this problem (the "standard" parameter). EOS A natural subject for investigation is what happens when we parameterize such a problem by various other parameters, some of which may be the values of optimal solutions to different problems. EOS Such research is known as parameterized ecology.	In this paper, we investigate seven natural vertex problems, along with their respective parameters: the size of a maximum independent set, the size of a minimum vertex cover, the size of a maximum clique, the chromatic number, the size of a minimum dominating set, the size of a minimum independent dominating set and the size of a minimum feedback vertex set.
doc	Foliation-coupling Dirac structures EOS We extend the notion of "coupling with a foliation" from Poisson to Dirac structures and get the corresponding generalization of the Vorobiev characterization of coupling Poisson structures. EOS We show that any Dirac structure is coupling with the fibers of a tubular neighborhood of an embedded presymplectic leaf, give new proofs of the results of Dufour and Wade on the transversal Poisson structure, and compute the Vorobiev structure of the total space of a normal bundle of the leaf.	Finally, we use the coupling condition along a submanifold, instead of a foliation, in order to discuss submanifolds of a Dirac manifold which have a differentiable, induced Dirac structure.
doc	Distortion of Hausdorff measures and improved Painlev\'e removability for quasiregular mappings EOS The classical Painlev\'e theorem tells that sets of zero length are removable for bounded analytic functions, while (some) sets of positive length are not. EOS For general _EQN_ -quasiregular mappings in planar domains the corresponding critical dimension is _EQN_. EOS We show that when _EQN_, unexpectedly one has improved removability. EOS More precisely, we prove that sets _EQN_ of _EQN_ -finite Hausdorff _EQN_ -measure are removable for bounded _EQN_ -quasiregular mappings. EOS On the other hand, _EQN_ is not enough to guarantee this property.	We also study absolute continuity properties of pull-backs of Hausdorff measures under _EQN_ -quasiconformal mappings, in particular at the relevant dimensions 1 and _EQN_.
doc	A Nanofiber-Based Optical Conveyor Belt for Cold Atoms EOS We demonstrate optical transport of cold cesium atoms over millimeter-scale distances along an optical nanofiber. EOS The atoms are trapped in a one-dimensional optical lattice formed by a two-color evanescent field surrounding the nanofiber, far red- and blue-detuned with respect to the atomic transition. EOS The blue-detuned field is a propagating nanofiber-guided mode while the red-detuned field is a standing-wave mode which leads to the periodic axial confinement of the atoms.	Here, this standing wave is used for transporting the atoms along the nanofiber by mutually detuning the two counter-propagating fields which form the standing wave.
doc	Berry phase and anomalous velocity of Weyl fermions and Maxwell photons EOS We consider two systems of wave equations whose wave-packet solutions have trajectories that are altered by the "anomalous velocity" effect of a Berry curvature. EOS The first is the matrix Weyl equation describing cyclotron motion of a charged massless fermion. EOS The second is Maxwell equations for the whispering-gallery modes of light in a cylindrical waveguide.	In the case of the massless fermion, the anomalous velocity is obscured by the contribution from the magnetic moment.
doc	Theory of the 2S-2P Lamb shift and 2S hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen EOS The 7 standard deviations between the proton rms charge radius from muonic hydrogen and the CODATA-10 value from hydrogen spectroscopy and electron-scattering has caused considerable discussions.

doc	Spectroscopic properties and lattice dynamics of ferroelectric and related functional oxide ceramics EOS Dielectric response as a function of frequency for high-permittivity dielectric and ferroelectric materials is discussed emphasizing the dynamic behaviour in the microwave and infrared range. EOS After introducing the usual modelling of the polar phonon response and anharmonic hopping in locally dynamically disordered solids, including discussion of displacive and order-disorder ferroelectric phase transitions, we summarised the experimental data for selected ferroelectric, incipient ferroelectric and antiferroelectric perovskite ceramics (STO, BTO, BST, PZO), discussing the dielectric grain size effect due to a low-permittivity (dead) grain-boundary layer. EOS Other important structural types of ferroelectrics (Aurivillius compounds SBT, pyrochlores CNO, PMN) are mentioned, as well. EOS Attention is then paid to relaxor ferroelectrics (PLZT, PMN, PMT, PST, NBT of perovskite structure and SBN and a novel BLNTN solid solution system and SLTN of tungsten-bronze structure) and their extremely broad and complex dielectric dispersion.	Then some new results on magnetoelectric multiferroics (BiFeO3, BiFe_(1/2)Cr_(1/2)O3, EuTiO3) are summarised and finally our results on microwave ceramics (used for microwave applications) are noted, discussing mainly the problem of extrapolating the microwave dielectric properties from the infrared and THz range.
doc	Magnetic properties and electronic structures of intermediate valence systems CeRhSi2 and Ce2Rh3Si5 EOS The crystal structures and the physical (magnetic, electrical transport and thermodynamic) properties of the ternary compounds CeRhSi2 and Ce2Rh3Si5 (orthorhombic CeNiSi2- and U2Co3Si5-type structures, respectively) were studied in wide ranges of temperature and magnetic field strength. EOS The results revealed that both materials are valence fluctuating systems, in line with previous literature reports.	Direct evidence for valence fluctuations was obtained by means of Ce LIII-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy and Ce 3d core-level x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
doc	The Chemical Composition of \tau Ceti and Possible Effects on Terrestrial Planets EOS \tau Ceti (HD10700), a G8 dwarf with solar mass of 0.78, is a close (3.65 pc) sun-like star where 5 possibly terrestrial planet candidates (minimum masses of 2, 3.1, 3.5, 4.3, and 6.7 Earth masses) have recently been discovered. EOS We report abundances of 23 elements using spectra from the MIKE spectrograph on Magellan. EOS Using stellar models with the abundances determined here, we calculate the position of the classical habitable zone with time. EOS At the current best fit age, 7.63 Gy, up to two planets (e and f) may be in the habitable zone, depending on atmospheric properties. EOS The Mg/Si ratio of the star is found to be 1.78, which is much greater than for Earth (about 1.2).	With a system that has such an excess of Mg to Si ratio it is possible that the mineralogical make-up of planets around \tau Ceti could be significantly different from that of Earth, with possible oversaturation of MgO, resulting in an increase in the content of olivine and ferropericlase compared with Earth.
doc	Nonequilibrium dynamical cluster theory EOS We study the effect of spatially nonlocal correlations on the nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting fermions by constructing the nonequilibrium dynamical cluster theory, a cluster generalization of the nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). EOS The formalism is applied to interaction quenches in the Hubbard model in one and two dimensions, and the results are compared with data from single-site DMFT, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group, and lattice perturbation theory. EOS Both in one and two dimensions the double occupancy quickly thermalizes, while the momentum distribution relaxes only on much longer time scales. EOS For the two-dimensional square lattice we find a strongly momentum-dependent evolution of the momentum distribution around the Fermi energy, with a much faster relaxation near the momenta _EQN_ and _EQN_ than near _EQN_.	This result is interpreted as reflecting the momentum-anisotropic quasiparticle lifetime of the marginal Fermi liquid.
doc	Lambda: A Mathematica-package for operator product expansions in vertex algebras EOS We give an introduction to the Mathematica package Lambda, designed for calculating _EQN_ -brackets in both vertex algebras, and in SUSY vertex algebras.	This is equivalent to calculating operator product expansions in two-dimensional conformal field theory.
doc	Synchronization of globally coupled two-state stochastic oscillators with a state dependent refractory period EOS We present a model of identical coupled two-state stochastic units each of which in isolation is governed by a fixed refractory period. EOS The nonlinear coupling between units directly affects the refractory period, which now depends on the global state of the system and can therefore itself become time dependent. EOS At weak coupling the array settles into a quiescent stationary state.	Increasing coupling strength leads to a saddle node bifurcation, beyond which the quiescent state coexists with a stable limit cycle of nonlinear coherent oscillations.
doc	Quantum Nature of Light Measured With a Single Detector EOS We realized the most fundamental quantum optical experiment to prove the non-classical character of light: Only a single quantum emitter and a single superconducting nanowire detector were used. EOS A particular appeal of our experiment is its elegance and simplicity. EOS Yet its results unambiguously enforce a quantum theory for light.	Previous experiments relied on more complex setups, such as the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss configuration, where a beam splitter directs light to two photodetectors, giving the false impression that the beam splitter is required.

Furthermore, in the kinematical ranges of the proposed EIC, electroproduction of strange and charmed mesons will allow one to uniquely pin down the non-perturbative charmed component in the nucleon structure function, and at the same time provide new insights in the connection of the quark/gluon degrees of freedom with the meson-baryon description.
doc	Dark matter in disk galaxies I: a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and application to DDO 154 EOS We present a new method to constrain the dark matter halo density profiles of disk galaxies. EOS Our algorithm employs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to explore the parameter space of a general family of dark matter profiles. EOS We improve upon previous analyses by considering a wider range of halo profiles and by explicitly identifying cases in which the data are insufficient to break the degeneracies between the model parameters. EOS We demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm using artificial data sets and show that reliable estimates of the halo density profile can be obtained from data of comparable quality to those currently available for low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. EOS We present our results in terms of physical quantities which are constrained by the data, and find that the logarithmic slope of the halo density profile at the radius of the innermost data point of a measured rotation curve can be strongly constrained in LSB ([Vstar/Vobs]max ~ 0.16) galaxies. EOS High surface brightness galaxies ([Vstar/Vobs]max ~ 0.79) require additional information on the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population - our approach naturally identifies those galaxies for which this is necessary.	We apply our method to observed data for the dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 154 and recover a logarithmic halo slope of -0.39 +- 0.11 at a radius of 0.14 kpc.
doc	Pseudoknot RNA structures with arc-length _EQN_ EOS In this paper we study _EQN_ -noncrossing RNA structures with minimum arc-length 4 and at most _EQN_ mutually crossing bonds. EOS Let _EQN_ denote the number of _EQN_ -noncrossing RNA structures with arc-length _EQN_ over _EQN_ vertices.	We prove (a) a functional equation for the generating function _EQN_ and (b) derive for _EQN_ the asymptotic formula _EQN_.

EOS The film shrunk into crystalline state nanoparticles that still kept (00l) preferential orientation as being annealed in the oxygen atmosphere at 500 oC for 2 hours.	These LiNbO3 nanoparticles exhibited the ferroelectricity, showing asymmetrical hysteresis loop which might originate from the large internal field at the interface.
doc	Mapping ideals of quantum group multipliers EOS We study the dual relationship between quantum group convolution maps _EQN_ and completely bounded multipliers of _EQN_. EOS For a large class of locally compact quantum groups _EQN_ we completely isomorphically identify the mapping ideal of row Hilbert space factorizable convolution maps with _EQN_, yielding a quantum Gilbert representation for completely bounded multipliers. EOS We also identify the mapping ideals of completely integral and completely nuclear convolution maps, the latter case coinciding with _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the quantum Bohr compactification of _EQN_. EOS For quantum groups whose dual has bounded degree, we show that the completely compact convolution maps coincide with _EQN_.	Our techniques comprise a mixture of operator space theory and abstract harmonic analysis, including Fubini tensor products, the non-commutative Grothendieck inequality, quantum Eberlein compactifications, and a suitable notion of quasi-SIN quantum group, which we introduce and exhibit examples from the bicrossed product construction.

EOS Branching fractions for a number of quasi-two-body intermediate states are reported.

For a significant range of parameters, the instability is found to be pre-empted by a first-order quantum phase transition.
doc	Exact results for deterministic cellular automata traffic models EOS We present a rigorous derivation of the flow at arbitrary time in a deterministic cellular automaton model of traffic flow. EOS The derivation employs regularities in preimages of blocks of zeros, reducing the problem of preimage enumeration to a well known lattice path counting problem.	Assuming infinite lattice size and random initial configuration, the flow can be expressed in terms of generalized hypergeometric function.
doc	On the D-branes Standard-like Models EOS Based on the low-energy effective field theory of D-branes, the mass spectrum of an extended Standard Model with two-Higgs doublets used to generate all the mass terms is investigated.	Besides the gauge bosons, the fermion mass spectrum is weighted by the Higgs VEVs with a partial hierarchy and the smallness of neutrino masses is exhibited.
doc	Searching in the dark: the hunt for the dark photon EOS The existence of Dark Matter (DM) is a well established fact since many decades, thanks to the observation of the effects of its gravitational interaction with the ordinary matter in the Universe. EOS However, our knowledge of the Dark Matter features is still rather scarce. EOS Indeed, one of the biggest quests in fundamental science today is the investigation of Dark Matter nature, from its origin to its composition, and the way its constituents interact with the ordinary matter, apart from gravity. EOS Huge and ambitious efforts have been spent in the last years into its identification, concentrating especially on the search of viable Weakly Interacting Massive Particle candidates. EOS However, no positive results have been achieved so far along this direction. EOS On the other hand, many fascinating new ideas and models for its interpretation have been blooming: among them, an intriguing hypothesis is that the Dark Matter constituents could be neutral under Standard Model interactions, but they could interact through a new, still unknown, force under a "hidden" charge.	This new hidden symmetry would be mediated by a massive gauge boson, the dark photon, which is expected to couple to the Standard Model via a kinetic mixing.
doc	Quantum Gravity via Manifold Positivity EOS The macroscopic dimensions of space should not be input but rather output of a general model for physics. EOS Here, dimensionality arises from a recently discovered mathematical bifurcation: positive versus indefinite manifold pairings. EOS It is used to build an action on a formal chain of combinatorial space-times of arbitrary dimension. EOS The context for such actions is 2-field theory where Feynman integrals are not over classical, but previously quantized configurations. EOS A topologically enforced singularity of the action terminates the dimension at four and, in fact, the final fourth dimension is Lorentzian due to light-like vectors in the four dimensional manifold pairing.	Our starting point is the action of causal dynamical triangulations but in a dimension-agnostic setting.
doc	Soft Supersymmetry Breaking and the Supersymmetric Standard Model EOS We recall how the idea of Softly Broken Supersymmetry led to the construction of the Supersymmetric Standard Model in 1981. EOS Its first prediction, the supersymmetric unification of gauge couplings, was conclusively verified by the LEP and SLC experiments 10 years later. EOS Its other predictions include: the existence of superparticles at the electroweak scale; EOS a stable lightest superparticle (LSP) with a mass of _EQN_ GeV, anticipated to be a neutral electroweak gaugino;	the universality of scalar and gaugino masses at the unification scale.

doc	Hamilton-Jacobi hydrodynamics of pulsating relativistic stars EOS The dynamics of self-gravitating fluid bodies is described by the Euler-Einstein system of partial differential equations. EOS The break-down of well-posedness on the fluid-vacuum interface remains a challenging open problem, which is manifested in simulations of oscillating or inspiraling binary neutron-stars. EOS We formulate and implement a well-posed canonical hydrodynamic scheme, suitable for neutron-star simulations in numerical general relativity. EOS The scheme uses a variational principle by Carter-Lichnerowicz stating that barotropic fluid motions are conformally geodesic and Helmholtz's third theorem stating that initially irrotational flows remain irrotational. EOS We apply this scheme in 3+1 numerical general relativity to evolve the canonical momentum of a fluid element via the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.	We explore a regularization scheme for the Euler equations, that uses a fiducial atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium and allows the pressure to vanish, while preserving strong hyperbolicity on the vacuum boundary.
doc	Quantum collapse in ground-state Fermi-Dirac-Landau plasmas EOS It is revealed that in a relativistically degenerate dense highly-magnetized electron-ion plasma the effective quantum-potential due to the total quantum-force acting on fermions may cancel-out causing a quantum transverse collapse in the ground-state Fermi-Dirac-Landau (GSFDL) plasma. EOS The condition for the plasma transverse collapse is found to be restricted to the minimum relativistic degeneracy parameter and minimum impressed magnetic field strength values satisfied for many superdense astrophysical objects such as white dwarfs and neutron stars. EOS In such plasmas, the magnetization pressure is shown to cancel the lateral electron degeneracy pressure counteracting the existing gravitational pressure.	Furthermore, using the Sagdeev pseudopotential method in the framework of quantum magnetohydrodynamics (QMHD) model including spin magnetization it is confirmed that the quantum pressure due to spin-orbit polarization and the electron relativistic degeneracy has significant effects on the existence criteria and the propagation of localized magnetosonic density excitations in GSFDL plasmas.
doc	Inflationary Reheating in Grand Unified Theories EOS Grand unified theories may display multiply interacting fields with strong coupling dynamics. EOS This poses two new problems: (1) What is the nature of chaotic reheating after inflation, and (2) How is reheating sensitive to the mass spectrum of these theories?	We answer these questions in two interesting limiting cases and demonstrate an increased efficiency of reheating which strongly enhances non-thermal topological defect formation, including monopoles and domain walls.
doc	On Cantor's important proofs EOS It is shown that the pillars of transfinite set theory, namely the uncountability proofs, do not hold. EOS (1) Cantor's first proof of the uncountability of the set of all real numbers does not apply to the set of irrational numbers alone, and, therefore, as it stands, supplies no distinction between the uncountable set of irrational numbers and the countable set of rational numbers. EOS (2) As Cantor's second uncount-ability proof, his famous second diagonalization method, is an impossibility proof, a simple counter-example suffices to prove its failure.	(3) The contradiction of any bijection between a set and its power set is a consequence of the impredicative definition involved.
doc	Probable cluster decays from _EQN_ 118 superheavy nuclei EOS The cluster decay process in _EQN_ 118 superheavy nuclei has been studied extensively within the Coulomb and proximity potential model (CPPM), thereby investigating the probable cluster decays from the various isotopes of _EQN_. EOS On comparing the predicted decay half lives with the values evaluated using the Universal formula for cluster decay (UNIV) of Poenaru et al, the Universal Decay Law (UDL) of Qi et al, and the Scaling Law of Horoi et al, it was seen that, our values matches well with these theoretical values. EOS A comparison of the predicted alpha decay half life of the experimentally synthesized superheavy isotope _EQN_ 118 with its corresponding experimental value shows that, our theoretical value is in good agreement with the experimental value.	The plots for _EQN_ against the neutron number of the daughter in the corresponding decay reveals the behavior of the cluster half lives with the neutron number of the daughter nuclei and for most of the decays, the half life was found to be the minimum for the decay leading to a daughter with _EQN_.
doc	Stellar Forensics I: Cooling Curves EOS The presence of low mass, degenerate secondaries in millisecond pulsar binaries offers the opportunity to determine an age for the binary system independent of the rotational properties of the pulsar. EOS To this end, we present here a detailed calculation of the evolution of a grid of low mass (_EQN_) helium core white dwarfs. EOS We investigate the effects of different Hydrogen layer masses and provide results for well-known optical band-passes.	We supplement the OPAL opacity calculations with our own calculations for low effective temperatures (_EQN_) and also provide fitting formulae for the gravity as a function of mass and effective temperature.
doc	Inward Motions of the Compact SiO Masers Around VX Sagittarii EOS We report Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of 43 GHz v=1, J=1-0 SiO masers in the circumstellar envelope of the M-type semi-regular variable star VX Sgr at 3 epochs during 1999 April-May. EOS These high-resolution VLBA images reveal a persistent ringlike distribution of SiO masers with a projected radius of ~3 stellar radii. EOS The typical angular size of 0.5 mas for individual maser feature was estimated from two-point correlation function analysis for maser spots. EOS We found that the apparent size scale of maser features was distinctly smaller than that observed in the previous observations by comparing their fractions of total power imaged. EOS This change in the size scale of maser emission may be related to stellar activity that caused a large SiO flare during our observations. EOS Our observations confirmed the asymmetric distribution of maser emission, but the overall morphology has changed significantly with the majority of masers clustering to the north-east of the star compared to that lying to the south-west direction in 1992.	By identifying 42 matched maser features appearing in all the three epochs, we determined the contraction of an SiO maser shell toward VX Sgr at a proper motion of -0.507 mas/yr, corresponding to a velocity of about 4 km/s at a distance of 1.7 kpc to VX Sgr.
doc	Crossed chiral band approximation for wideband self-collimation of light EOS We propose a perspective to the evaluation of the wide bandwidth phenomenon, by introducing the band tailoring and chiral band approximation on the self-collimation effect for low-symmetric photonic structures. EOS In the case of the crossing of the bands, we claim the excitation of the lower mode can provide the utilization of the entire bandwidth by suppressing the intersection regions where the frequencies tend to mix. EOS Thereby, we design broadband self-collimation capable, defect-free photonic structures and examine their performances. EOS A fractional bandwidth of _EQN_ (_EQN_) and _EQN_ (_EQN_) are achieved for radii of _EQN_ and _EQN_, respectively.	We explore the full-range collimation using transmission and E-field intensity analysis in addition to band diagrams and group velocity dispersions.
doc	SO(10) Yukawa Unification with mu < 0 EOS We consider the low energy implications including particle spectroscopy of SO(10) inspired t-b-tau Yukawa coupling unification with mu < 0, where mu is the coefficient of the bilinear Higgs mixing term of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). EOS We imploy non-universal MSSM gaugino masses induced by SO(10) invariant dimension five operators, such that the total number of fundamental parameters is precisely the same as in Yukawa unified supersymmetric SO(10) models with universal gaugino masses and mu > 0. EOS We find that t-b-tau Yukawa unification with mu < 0 is compatible with the current experimental bounds, including the WMAP bound on neutralino dark matter and the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment.	We present a variety of benchmark points which include relatively light squarks (~ TeV) of the first two families and an example in which the bottom and top squarks are lighter than the gluino.
doc	Prospects for Probing Triple Gauge-boson Couplings at the LHC EOS In these proceedings I explore one aspect of gauge-boson physics at the LHC - Triple Gauge-boson Couplings (TGCs) in _EQN_ and Wgamma production. EOS Methods for extracting confidence limits on anomalous TGCs are assessed, while accounting for the effects of higher order QCD corrections and contributions from other theoretical and detector related systematics. EOS Detector response has been parametrised according to the ATLAS detector's specifications.	A strategy for reporting the anomalous coupling limits is introduced which removes the ambiguities of form factors by reporting the limits as a function of a cutoff operating on the diboson system invariant mass.
doc	Decomposing generalized bent and hyperbent functions EOS In this paper we introduce generalized hyperbent functions from _EQN_ to _EQN_, and investigate decompositions of generalized (hyper)bent functions. EOS We show that generalized (hyper)bent functions from _EQN_ to _EQN_ consist of components which are generalized (hyper)bent functions from _EQN_ to _EQN_ for some _EQN_.	For odd _EQN_, we show that the Boolean functions associated to a generalized bent function form an affine space of semibent functions.

doc	Dyson's Brownian Motion and Universal Dynamics of Quantum Systems EOS We establish a correspondence between the evolution of the distribution of eigenvalues of a _EQN_ matrix subject to a random Gaussian perturbing matrix, and a Fokker-Planck equation postulated by Dyson.	Within this model, we prove the equivalence conjectured by Altshuler et al between the space-time correlations of the Sutherland-Calogero-Moser system in the thermodynamic limit and a set of two-variable correlations for disordered quantum systems calculated by them.
doc	Neural Decision Trees EOS In this paper we propose a synergistic melting of neural networks and decision trees (DT) we call neural decision trees (NDT). EOS NDT is an architecture a la decision tree where each splitting node is an independent multilayer perceptron allowing oblique decision functions or arbritrary nonlinear decision function if more than one layer is used. EOS This way, each MLP can be seen as a node of the tree. EOS We then show that with the weight sharing asumption among those units, we end up with a Hashing Neural Network (HNN) which is a multilayer perceptron with sigmoid activation function for the last layer as opposed to the standard softmax. EOS The output units then jointly represent the probability to be in a particular region. EOS The proposed framework allows for global optimization as opposed to greedy in DT and differentiability w.r.t. EOS all parameters and the input, allowing easy integration in any learnable pipeline, for example after CNNs for computer vision tasks.	We also demonstrate the modeling power of HNN allowing to learn union of disjoint regions for final clustering or classification making it more general and powerful than standard softmax MLP requiring linear separability thus reducing the need on the inner layer to perform complex data transformations.

We classify such pairs in the following two cases: (i) _EQN_ is an ample divisor and _EQN_ is isomorphic to a smooth complete intersection in a rational homogeneous space with Picard number one;

doc	Truncation in Average and Worst Case Settings for Special Classes of _EQN_ -Variate Functions EOS The paper considers truncation errors for functions of the form _EQN_, i.e., errors of approximating _EQN_ by _EQN_, where the numbers _EQN_ converge to zero sufficiently fast and _EQN_ 's are i.i.d. EOS random variables. EOS As explained in the introduction, functions _EQN_ of the form above appear in a number of important applications. EOS To have positive results for possibly large classes of such functions, the paper provides sharp bounds on truncation errors in both the average and worst case settings.	In the former case, the functions _EQN_ are from a Hilbert space _EQN_ endowed with a zero mean probability measure with a given covariance kernel.

doc	Universal spin-1/2 fermion field localization on a 5D braneworld EOS In this letter we have proposed a natural way of determine the Yukawa coupling _EQN_ for the 5D bulk action, the form of the _EQN_ function allows us to localize the spin-- _EQN_ fermionic fields in the paradigm of the 5D braneworld scenarios. EOS The structure acquired by the _EQN_ potentials is induced by the ansatz for the _EQN_ function and we show that this choice allows the localization of the left-- or right--chiral KK zero modes _EQN_, _EQN_ and excludes the tachyonic modes of the KK mass spectrum _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS The proposal for the function _EQN_ leaves behind other speculative proposals since it is independent of the braneworld model, hence the form for the Yukawa coupling here presented is the most natural choice. EOS This is shown most evidently if we set _EQN_, which is a more phenomenologically viable ansatz.	This choice allows for a direct relation between the localization of the ground state for the left-- or right--chiral KK mass spectrum and the localization of the zero mode for the 4D graviton in the brane.
doc	Recognition of symmetries in reversible maps EOS We deal with germs of diffeomorphisms that are reversible under an involution. EOS We establish that this condition implies that, in general, both the family of reversing symmetries and the group of symmetries are not finite, in contrast with continuous-time dynamics, where typically there are finitely many reversing symmetries.	From this we obtain two chains of fixed-points subspaces of involutory reversing symmetries that we use to obtain geometric information on the discrete dynamics generated by a given diffeomorphism.

doc	Oscillatory Spin Polarization and Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect in Fe3O4 Thin Films on GaAs(001) EOS The spin dependent properties of epitaxial Fe3O4 thin films on GaAs(001) are studied by the ferromagnetic proximity polarization (FPP) effect and magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE). EOS Both FPP and MOKE show oscillations with respect to Fe3O4 film thickness, and the oscillations are large enough to induce repeated sign reversals.	We attribute the oscillatory behavior to spin-polarized quantum well states forming in the Fe3O4 film.

doc	Epidemic spreading driven by biased random walks EOS Random walk is one of the basic mechanisms found in many network applications. EOS We study the epidemic spreading dynamics driven by biased random walks on complex networks. EOS In our epidemic model, each time infected nodes constantly spread some infected packets by biased random walks to their neighbor nodes causing the infection of the susceptible nodes that receive the packets. EOS An infected node get recovered from infection with a fixed probability.	Simulation and analytical results on model and real-world networks show that the epidemic spreading becomes intense and wide with the increase of delivery capacity of infected nodes, average node degree, homogeneity of node degree distribution.

doc	The static quark self-energy at O(_EQN_) in perturbation theory EOS In Refs. EOS [1,2] we determined the infinite volume coefficients of the perturbative expansions of the self-energies of static sources in the fundamental and adjoint representations in SU(3) gluodynamics to order _EQN_. EOS We used numerical stochastic perturbation theory, where we employed a new second order integrator and twisted boundary conditions. EOS The expansions were obtained in lattice regularization with the Wilson action and two different discretizations of the covariant time derivative within the Polyakov loop. EOS Overall, we obtained four different perturbative series. EOS For all of them the high order coefficients displayed the factorial growth predicted by the conjectured renormalon picture, based on the operator product expansion.	This enabled us to determine the normalization constants of the leading infrared renormalons of heavy quark and heavy gluino pole masses.
doc	Fermi surfaces in Kondo insulators EOS We report magnetic quantum oscillations measured using torque magnetisation in the Kondo insulator YbB _EQN_ and discuss the potential origin of the underlying Fermi surface. EOS Observed quantum oscillations as well as complementary quantities such as a finite linear specific heat capacity in YbB _EQN_ exhibit similarities with the Kondo insulator SmB _EQN_, yet also crucial differences.	Small heavy Fermi sections are observed in YbB _EQN_ with similarities to the neighbouring heavy fermion semimetallic Fermi surface, in contrast to large light Fermi surface sections in SmB _EQN_ which are more similar to the conduction electron Fermi surface.

It is found that the product of the e+e- partial width and X(3872) --> pi+ pi- J/psi decay branching fraction is less than 10 eV at 90 % confidence level if the J(PC) of X(3872) is 1(--).

doc	Investigation of Surface State of Topological Kondo Insulator with Rashba Impurities EOS We study a generic topological Kondo insulator system by performing a mean-field theoretic calculation within the frame-work of slave-boson protocol. EOS We assume infinite Hubbard-type interaction among the localized electrons. EOS The difference between the bulk metallic and insulating phases of the insulator is in the sign of nearest neighbor hopping of localized electrons. EOS The hopping amplitude is positive for the metallic and negative for the insulating phase. EOS The surface metallicity together with bulk insulation, however, requires very strong f electron localization. EOS Furthermore, we find that the exchange field, arising due to the presence of the magnetic impurities on the surface of the system, opens a gap at the gapless Dirac dispersion of the surface states. EOS For the gapped surface state spectrum, we find the possibility of intra-band as well as inter-band unconventional plasmons. EOS The paramountcy of the bulk metallicity, and, in the presence of the Rashba impurities, the insulator surface comprising of helical liquids are the important outcomes of the present communication.	The access to the gapless Dirac spectrum leads to spin plasmons with the usual wave vector dependence q^1/2.

doc	Automorphisms and opposition in twin buildings EOS We show that every automorphism of a thick twin building interchanging the halves of the building maps some residue to an opposite one. EOS Furthermore we show that no automorphism of a locally finite 2-spherical twin building of rank at least 3 maps every residue of one fixed type to an opposite.	The main ingredient of the proof is a lemma that states that every duality of a thick finite projective plane admits an absolute point, i.e., a point mapped onto an incident line.
doc	Classical behaviour of the Dirac bispinor EOS It is usually supposed that the Dirac and radiation equations predict that the phase of a fermion will rotate through half the angle through which the fermion is rotated, which means, via the measured dynamical and geometrical phase factors, that the fermion must have a half-integral spin. EOS We demonstrate that this is not the case and that the identical relativistic quantum mechanics can also be derived with the phase of the fermion rotating through the same angle as does the fermion itself.	Under spatial rotation and Lorentz transformation the bispinor transforms as a four-vector like the potential and Dirac current.
doc	Band Bending Independent of Surface Passivation in ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) _EQN_ Heterojunctions and Cr/Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) _EQN_ Schottky Contacts EOS We have employed admittance spectroscopy and deep-level transient spectroscopy in order to investigate the electronic properties of ZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) _EQN_ heterojunctions and Cr/Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) _EQN_ Schottky contacts. EOS Our work concentrates on the origin of an energy-distributed defect state commonly found in these systems. EOS The activation energy of the defect state addressed continuously shifts upon air annealing or damp-heat treatment and is a valuable measure of the degree of band bending in Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) _EQN_ -based junctions.	We demonstrate that the band bending within the Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se) _EQN_ layer, reported in the literature to become minimal after air exposure, returns after the formation of either a Schottky contact or a heterojunction.
doc	Opening the black box of deep learning EOS The great success of deep learning shows that its technology contains profound truth, and understanding its internal mechanism not only has important implications for the development of its technology and effective application in various fields, but also provides meaningful insights into the understanding of human brain mechanism. EOS At present, most of the theoretical research on deep learning is based on mathematics. EOS This dissertation proposes that the neural network of deep learning is a physical system, examines deep learning from three different perspectives: microscopic, macroscopic, and physical world views, answers multiple theoretical puzzles in deep learning by using physics principles.	For example, from the perspective of quantum mechanics and statistical physics, this dissertation presents the calculation methods for convolution calculation, pooling, normalization, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine, as well as the selection of cost functions, explains why deep learning must be deep, what characteristics are learned in deep learning, why Convolutional Neural Networks do not have to be trained layer by layer, and the limitations of deep learning, etc., and proposes the theoretical direction and basis for the further development of deep learning now and in the future.
doc	A new test of the light dark matter hypothesis EOS Detection of a surprisingly high flux of positron annihilation radiation from the inner galaxy has motivated the proposal that dark matter is made of weakly interacting light particles (possibly as light as the electron). EOS This scenario is extremely hard to test in current high energy physics experiments.	Here, however, we demonstrate that the current value of the electron anomalous magnetic moment already has the required precision to unambiguously test the light dark matter hypothesis.

EOS We discuss the production of ultra high energy secondary protons by cosmic ray primary nuclei propagating in the intergalactic space through Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Infrared (IR) radiations.	Under the assumption that only primary nuclei with a fixed atomic mass number _EQN_ are accelerated, the spectrum of secondary protons is calculated.

doc	Quantitative Morphological Optimization of Bicontinuous Pickering Emulsions via Interfacial Curvatures EOS Bicontinuous Pickering emulsions (bijels) are a physically interesting class of soft materials with many potential applications including catalysis, microfluidics and tissue engineering. EOS They are created by arresting the spinodal decomposition of a partially-miscible liquid with a (jammed) layer of interfacial colloids. EOS Porosity _EQN_ (average interfacial separation) of the bijel is controlled by varying the radius (_EQN_) and volume fraction (_EQN_) of the colloids (_EQN_). EOS However, to optimize the bijel structure with respect to other parameters, e.g. EOS quench rate, characterizing by _EQN_ alone is insufficient.	Hence, we have used confocal microscopy and X-ray CT to characterize a range of bijels in terms of local and area-averaged interfacial curvatures.
doc	On-chip coherent conversion of photonic quantum signals between different degrees of freedom EOS In the quantum world, a single particle can have various degrees of freedom to encode quantum information. EOS Controlling multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously is necessary to describe a particle fully and, therefore, to use it more efficiently. EOS Here we introduce the transverse waveguide-mode degree of freedom to quantum photonic integrated circuits, and demonstrate the coherent conversion of a photonic quantum state between path, polarization and transverse waveguide-mode degrees of freedom on a single chip.	The preservation of quantum coherence in these conversion processes is proven by single-photon and two-photon quantum interference using a fibre beam splitter or on-chip beam splitters.
doc	Supernova Neutrino Detection with IceCube EOS IceCube was completed in December 2010. EOS It forms a lattice of 5160 photomultiplier tubes that monitor a volume of ~ 1 cubic km in the deep Antarctic ice for particle induced photons. EOS The telescope was designed to detect neutrinos with energies greater than 100 GeV. EOS Owing to subfreezing ice temperatures, the photomultiplier dark noise rates are particularly low. EOS Hence IceCube can also detect large numbers of MeV neutrinos by observing a collective rise in all photomultiplier rates on top of the dark noise. EOS With 2 ms timing resolution, IceCube can track subtle features in the temporal development of the supernova neutrino burst. EOS For a supernova at the galactic center, its sensitivity matches that of a background-free megaton-scale supernova search experiment. EOS The sensitivity decreases to 20 standard deviations at the galactic edge (30 kpc) and 6 standard deviations at the Large Magellanic Cloud (50 kpc). EOS IceCube is sending triggers from potential supernovae to the Supernova Early Warning System.	The sensitivity to neutrino properties such as the neutrino hierarchy is discussed and simulations of tantalizing signatures, such as the formation of a quark star or a black hole as well as the characteristics of shock waves are presented.
doc	Discrete Q- and P-symbols for spin s EOS Non-orthogonal bases of projectors on coherent states are introduced to expand hermitean operators acting on the Hilbert space of a spin s. EOS It is shown that the expectation values of a hermitean operator A in a family of (2s+1)(2s+1) spin-coherent states determine the operator unambiguously. EOS In other words, knowing the Q-symbol of A at (2s+1)(2s+1) points on the unit sphere is already sufficient in order to recover the operator.	This provides a straightforward method to reconstruct the mixed state of a spin since its density matrix is explicitly parametrized in terms of expectation values.
doc	Brane World EOS In string theory, the brane world scenario, where the Standard Model gauge and matter fields live inside some branes while gravitons live in the bulk, can be a viable description of our universe. EOS In this note we argue that the brane world actually is a likely description of nature.	Our discussion includes a revisit of certain issues, namely, coupling unification, dilaton stabilization and supersymmetry breaking, in the context of the brane world scenario.
doc	Noisy Simulation of Quantum Beats in Radical Pairs on a Quantum Computer EOS Current and near term quantum computers (i.e. EOS NISQ devices) are limited in their computational power in part due to imperfect gate operations and imperfect qubits. EOS This naturally constrains the computations run on these devices to be low-depth and short lived, lest the output turn to random noise. EOS Here we seek to take advantage of the imperfect qubit as a means of simulating thermal relaxation in physical systems with no additional computational overhead. EOS As a first step toward this goal we simulate the thermal relaxation of quantum beats in radical pairs on a quantum computer. EOS Our approach is to classically compute a dynamic quantity of interest, construct a parameterized quantum circuit which returns this quantity as a function of the parameters (e.g. EOS magnetic field, time), then simulate the system undergoing thermal relaxation. EOS We simulate the thermal relaxation by 1) explicitly constructing an ancillary circuit to implement Kraus operators associated with the thermal decay channels. EOS 2) Adding wait cycles into the quantum circuit to allow the natural thermal decay of the qubits to effectively simulate the thermal decay of the system of interest. EOS Time dependence of radical pairs in a magnetic field as the dynamical quantity of interest was chosen because it is amenable to analytic solutions classically and also has readily available experimental data, allowing for easy and robust comparison of the results.	We find the Kraus operator method gives very accurate results, agreeing with the experiment across its entire range of validity and having a mean squared error of 0.015% compared to the theoretical calculations.
doc	Fluctuation probes of quark deconfinement	The magnitude of the local fluctuations of the net baryon number and electric charge differs widely between the confined and deconfined phases, and the difference is partially frozen at an early stage in relativistic heavy ion collisions.
doc	Skewness and kurtosis of net baryon-number distributions at small values of the baryon chemical potential EOS We present results for the ratios of mean (_EQN_), variance (_EQN_), skewness (_EQN_ and kurtosis (_EQN_) of net baryon-number fluctuations obtained in lattice QCD calculations with a physical light to strange quark mass ratio. EOS Using next-to-leading order Taylor expansions in baryon chemical potential we find that qualitative features of these ratios closely resemble the corresponding experimentally measured cumulants ratios of net proton-number fluctuations for beam energies down to _EQN_ GeV.	We show that the difference in cumulant ratios for the mean net baryon-number, _EQN_ and the normalized skewness, _EQN_, naturally arises in QCD thermodynamics.
doc	Material and device characterization of Type-II InAS/GaSb superlattice infrared detectors EOS This work investigates midwave infrared Type-II InAs/GaSb superlattice (SL) grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaSb substrate. EOS In order to compensate the natural tensile strain of the InAs layers, two different shutter sequences have been explored during the growth. EOS The first one consists of growing an intentional InSb layer at both interfaces (namely GaSb-on-InAs and InAs-on-GaSb interfaces) by migration enhanced epitaxy while the second uses the antimony-for-arsenic exchange to promote an InSb-like interface at the GaSb-on-InAs interface. EOS SLs obtained via both methods are compared in terms of structural, morphological and optical properties by means of high-resolution x-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. EOS By using the second method, we obtained a nearly strain-compensated SL on GaSb with a full width at half maximum of 56 arcsec for the first-order SL satellite peak.	Relatively smooth surface has been achieved with a root mean square value of about 0.19 nm on a 2 _EQN_ x 2 _EQN_ scan area.
doc	The Lie algebra structure on the first Hochschild cohomology group of a monomial algebra EOS We study the Lie algebra structure of the first Hochschild cohomology group of a finite dimensional monomial algebra A, in terms of the combinatorics of its quiver, in any characteristic.	This allows us also to examine the identity component of the algebraic group of outer automorphisms of A in characteristic zero.
doc	Constraining Sterile Neutrinos from Precision Higgs Data EOS We use the LHC Higgs data to derive updated constraints on electroweak-scale sterile neutrinos that naturally occur in many low-scale seesaw extensions of the Standard Model to explain the neutrino masses.	We also analyze the signal sensitivity for a new final state involving a single charged lepton and two jets with missing energy, which arises from the decay of sterile neutrinos produced through the Higgs and _EQN_ boson mediated processes at the LHC.
doc	Radio observations of candidate magnetic O stars EOS Context: Some O stars are suspected to have to have (weak) magnetic fields because of the observed cyclical variability in their UV wind-lines. EOS However, direct detections of these magnetic fields using optical spectropolarimetry have proven to be very difficult. EOS Aims: Non-thermal radio emission in these objects would most likely be due to synchrotron radiation. EOS As a magnetic field is required for the production of synchrotron radiation, this would be strong evidence for the presence of a magnetic field. EOS Such non-thermal emission has already been observed from the strongly magnetic Ap/Bp stars. EOS Methods: We have performed 6 & 21 cm observations using the WSRT and use these, in combination with archival VLA data at 3.6 cm and results from the literature, to study the radio emission of 5 selected candidate magnetic O stars. EOS Results: Out of our five targets, we have detected three: _EQN_ Per, which shows a non-thermal radio spectrum, and _EQN_ Cam and _EQN_ Cep, which show no evidence of a non-thermal spectrum.	In general we find that the observed free-free (thermal) flux of the stellar wind is lower than expected.
doc	Dilatonic, Chiral Cosmic Strings EOS In this work, we deal with the chiral string model for which the world-sheet current is null in the framework of a scalar-tensor gravity. EOS Our main goal is to analyse the impact of such a current on the gravitational macroscopic effects.	For the purpose of this analysis, we first study the gravitational properties of the spacetime generated by this string in the presence of a dilaton field.
doc	Secondary scintillation yield of Xenon with sub-percent levels of CO2 additive: efficiently reducing electron diffusion in HPXe optical TPCs for rare-event detection EOS We have measured the electroluminescence (EL) yield of Xe-CO2 mixtures, with sub-percent CO2 concentrations. EOS We demonstrate that the EL production is still high in these mixtures, 70% and 35% relative to that produced in pure xenon, for CO2 concentrations around 0.05% and 0.1%, respectively. EOS The contribution of the statistical fluctuations in EL production to the energy resolution increases with increasing CO2 concentration and, for our gas proportional scintillation counter, it is smaller than the contribution of the Fano factor for concentrations below 0.1% CO2.	Xe-CO2 mixtures are important alternatives to pure xenon in TPCs based on EL signal amplification with applications in the important field of rare event detection such as directional dark matter, double electron capture and double beta decay detection.
doc	Entanglement entropy in lattice theories with Abelian gauge groups EOS We revisit the issue of the geometrical separability of the Hilbert space of physical states on lattice Abelian theories in the context of entanglement entropy.	We discuss the conditions under which vectors in the Hilbert space, as well as the gauge invariant algebra, admit a tensor product decomposition with a geometrical interpretation.
doc	A quantum version of the algebra of distributions of _EQN_ EOS Let _EQN_ be a primitive root of unity of order _EQN_. EOS We introduce a family of finite-dimensional algebras _EQN_ over the complex numbers, such that _EQN_ is a subalgebra of _EQN_ if _EQN_, and _EQN_ is a _EQN_ -cleft extension.	The simple _EQN_ -modules _EQN_ are highest weight modules, which admit a tensor product decomposition: the first factor is a simple _EQN_ -module and the second factor is a simple _EQN_ -module.
doc	On the Existence of Meta-stable Vacua in Klebanov-Strassler EOS We solve for the complete space of linearized deformations of the Klebanov-Strassler background consistent with the symmetries preserved by a stack of anti-D3 branes smeared on the _EQN_ of the deformed conifold. EOS We find that the only solution whose UV physics is consistent with that of a perturbation produced by anti-D3 branes must have a singularity in the infrared, coming from NS and RR three-form field strengths whose energy density diverges. EOS If this singularity is admissible, our solution describes the backreaction of the anti-D3 branes, and is thus likely to be dual to the conjectured metastable vacuum in the Klebanov-Strassler field theory.	If this singularity is not admissible, then our analysis strongly suggests that anti-D3 branes do not give rise to metastable Klebanov-Strassler vacua, which would have dramatic consequences for some string theory constructions of de Sitter space.
doc	Semi-classical analysis on H-type groups EOS In this paper, we develop a semi-classical analysis on H-type groups. EOS We define semi-classical pseudodifferential operators, prove the boundedness of their action on square integrable functions and develop a symbolic calculus.	Then, we define the semi-classical measures of bounded families of square integrable functions which consists of a pair formed by a measure defined on the product of the group and its unitary dual, and by a field of trace class positive operators acting on the Hilbert spaces of the representations.
doc	Two-loop electroweak next-to-leading logarithms for processes involving heavy quarks EOS We derive logarithmically enhanced two-loop virtual electroweak corrections for arbitrary fermion-scattering processes at the TeV scale.

doc	Effective Field Theory Approach to High-Temperature Thermodynamics EOS An effective field theory approach is developed for calculating the thermodynamic properties of a field theory at high temperature _EQN_ and weak coupling _EQN_. EOS The effective theory is the 3-dimensional field theory obtained by dimensional reduction to the bosonic zero-frequency modes. EOS The parameters of the effective theory can be calculated as perturbation series in the running coupling constant _EQN_. EOS The free energy is separated into the contributions from the momentum scales _EQN_ and _EQN_, respectively. EOS The first term can be written as a perturbation series in _EQN_. EOS If all forces are screened at the scale _EQN_, the second term can be calculated as a perturbation series in _EQN_ beginning at order _EQN_.	The parameters of the effective theory satisfy renormalization group equations that can be used to sum up leading logarithms of _EQN_.
doc	Simon's conjecture for 2-bridge knots	It is conjectured that for each knot _EQN_ in _EQN_, the fundamental group of its complement surjects onto only finitely many distinct knot groups.
doc	Identifying First-person Camera Wearers in Third-person Videos EOS We consider scenarios in which we wish to perform joint scene understanding, object tracking, activity recognition, and other tasks in environments in which multiple people are wearing body-worn cameras while a third-person static camera also captures the scene. EOS To do this, we need to establish person-level correspondences across first- and third-person videos, which is challenging because the camera wearer is not visible from his/her own egocentric video, preventing the use of direct feature matching. EOS In this paper, we propose a new semi-Siamese Convolutional Neural Network architecture to address this novel challenge. EOS We formulate the problem as learning a joint embedding space for first- and third-person videos that considers both spatial- and motion-domain cues.	A new triplet loss function is designed to minimize the distance between correct first- and third-person matches while maximizing the distance between incorrect ones.
doc	Entanglement entropy and the Berry phase in solid states EOS The entanglement entropy (von Neumann entropy) has been used to characterize the complexity of many-body ground states in strongly correlated systems. EOS In this paper, we try to establish a connection between the lower bound of the von Neumann entropy and the Berry phase defined for quantum ground states. EOS As an example, a family of translational invariant lattice free fermion systems with two bands separated by a finite gap is investigated.	We argue that, for one dimensional (1D) cases, when the Berry phase (Zak's phase) of the occupied band is equal to _EQN_ and when the ground state respects a discrete unitary particle-hole symmetry (chiral symmetry), the entanglement entropy in the thermodynamic limit is at least larger than _EQN_ (per boundary), i.e., the entanglement entropy that corresponds to a maximally entangled pair of two qubits.
doc	Reduced Activity And Large Particles From the Disintegrating Planet Candidate KIC 12557548b EOS The intriguing exoplanet candidate KIC 12557548b is believed to have a comet-like tail of dusty debris trailing a small rocky planet. EOS The tail of debris scatters up to 1.3% of the stellar light in the Kepler observatory's bandpass (0.42 um to 0.9 um). EOS Observing the tail's transit depth at multiple wavelengths can reveal the composition and particle size of the debris, constraining the makeup and lifetime of the sub-Mercury planet. EOS Early dust particle size predictions from the scattering of the comet-like tail pointed towards a dust size of ~0.1 um for silicate compositions. EOS These small particles would produce a much deeper optical transit depth than near-infrared transit depth. EOS We measure a transmission spectrum for KIC 12557548b using the SpeX spectrograph (covering 0.8 um to 2.4 um) simultaneously with the MORIS imager taking r' (0.63 um) photometry on the Infrared Telescope Facility for eight nights and one night in H band (1.63 um) using the Wide-Field IR Camera at the Palomar 200-inch telescope. EOS The infrared spectra are plagued by systematic errors, but we argue that sufficient precision is obtained when using differential spectroscopic calibration when combining multiple nights.	The average differential transmission spectrum is flat, supporting findings that KIC 12557548b's debris is likely composed of larger particles > ~0.5 um for pyroxene and olivine and > ~0.2 um for iron and corundum.
doc	Spectroscopic study of blue compact galaxies V. oxygen abundance and the metallicity-luminosity relation EOS This is the fifth paper in a series studying the stellar components, star formation histories, star formation rates and metallicities of a blue compact galaxy (BCG) sample. EOS Based on our high-quality ground-based spectroscopic observations, we have determined the electron temperatures, electron densities, nitrogen abundances and oxygen abundances for 72 star-forming BCGs in our sample, using different oxygen abundance indicators. EOS The oxygen abundance covers the range 7.15 < 12 + log (O/H)< 9.0, and nitrogen is found to be mostly a product of secondary nucleosynthesis for 12 + log (O/H)>8.2 and apparently a product of primary nucleosynthesis for 12 + log (O/H)< 8.2. EOS To assess the possible systematic differences among different oxygen abundance indicators, we have compared oxygen abundances of BCGs obtained with the Te method, R23 method, P method, N2 method and O3N2 method. EOS The oxygen abundances derived from the Te method are systematically lower by 0.1-0.25 dex than those derived from the strong line empirical abundance indicators, consistent with previous studies based on region samples. EOS We confirm the existence of the metallicity-luminosity relation in BCGs over a large range of abundances and luminosities. EOS Our sample of galaxies shows that the slope of the metallicity-luminosity relation for the luminous galaxies (~-0.05) is slightly shallower than that for the dwarf galaxies (~-0.17).	An offset was found in the metallicity-luminosity relation of the local galaxies and that of the intermediate redshift galaxies.
doc	On the sum of simultaneously proximinal sets EOS In this paper, we show that the sum of a compact convex subset and a simultaneously _EQN_ -strongly proximinal convex subset (resp. EOS simultaneously approximatively _EQN_ -compact convex subset) of a Banach space X is simultaneously tau-strongly proximinal (resp.	simultaneously approximatively _EQN_ -compact), and the sum of weakly compact convex subset and a simultaneously approximatively weakly compact convex subset of X is still simultaneously approximatively weakly compact, where _EQN_ is the norm or the weak topology.
doc	Exotic Anti-Decuplet of Baryons: Prediction from Chiral Solitons	We predict an exotic Z^+ baryon (having spin 1/2, isospin 0 and strangeness +1) with a relatively low mass of about 1530 MeV and total width of less than 15 MeV.
doc	On the mod _EQN_ cohomology for _EQN_: the non-semisimple case EOS Let _EQN_ be a totally real field unramified at all places above _EQN_ and _EQN_ be a quaternion algebra which splits at either none, or exactly one, of the infinite places. EOS Let _EQN_ be a continuous irreducible representation which, when restricted to a fixed place _EQN_, is non-semisimple and sufficiently generic. EOS Under some mild assumptions, we prove that the admissible smooth representations of _EQN_ occurring in the corresponding Hecke eigenspaces of the mod _EQN_ cohomology of Shimura varieties associated to _EQN_ have Gelfand-Kirillov dimension _EQN_.	We also prove that any such representation can be generated as a _EQN_ -representation by its subspace of invariants under the first principal congruence subgroup.
doc	Thermodynamics of itinerant magnets in a classical spin fluctuation model EOS Thermodynamics of itinerant magnets is studied using a classical model with one parameter characterizing the degree of itinerancy. EOS Monte Carlo simulations for bcc and fcc lattices are compared with the mean-field approximation and with the Onsager cavity field approximation extended to itinerant systems. EOS The qualitative features of thermodynamics are similar to the known results of the functional integral method. EOS It is found that magnetic short-range order is weak and almost independent on the degree of itinerancy, and the mean-field approximation describes the thermodynamics reasonably well. EOS Ambiguity of the phase space measure for classical models is emphasized.	The Onsager cavity field method is extended to itinerant systems, which involves the renormalization of both the Weiss field and the on-site exchange interaction.
doc	One possible mechanism for massive neutron star supported by soft	EOS The recently discovery of a massive neutron star (PSR J1614-2230 of _EQN_) rules out the soft equation of states (EOSs) such as those included hyperons or kaon condensates at high densities, while the nuclear theory or the terrestrial laboratory data prefer a soft EOS.
doc	Towards computational insights into the large-scale structure of spin foams EOS Understanding the large-scale physics is crucial for the spin foam approach to quantum gravity. EOS We tackle this challenge from a statistical physics perspective using simplified, yet feature-rich models.	In particular, this allows us to explicitly answer whether broken symmetries will be restored by renormalization: We observe a weak phase transition in both Migdal-Kadanoff and tensor network renormalization.
doc	Elliptical graphical modelling EOS We propose elliptical graphical models based on conditional uncorrelatedness as a general- ization of Gaussian graphical models by letting the population distribution be elliptical instead of normal, allowing the fitting of data with arbitrarily heavy tails. EOS We study the class of propor- tionally affine equivariant scatter estimators and show how they can be used to perform elliptical graphical modelling, leading to a new class of partial correlation estimators and analogues of the classical deviance test. EOS General expressions for the asymptotic variance of partial correla- tion estimators, unconstrained and under decomposable models, are given, and the asymptotic chi square approximation of the pseudo-deviance test statistic is proved. EOS The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by a simulation study, using, among others, Tyler's scatter estimator, which is distribution-free within the elliptical model.	Our approach provides a robustification of Gaussian graphical modelling.

Selecting events with two isolated leptons, each either an electron or a muon, 8 candidate events are observed with an expected background of _EQN_ events.
doc	Statistical Inference of Kumaraswamy distribution under imprecise information EOS Traditional statistical approaches for estimating the parameters of the Kumaraswamy distribution have dealt with precise information. EOS However, in real world situations, some information about an underlying experimental process might be imprecise and might be represented in the form of fuzzy information. EOS In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a univariate Kumaraswamy distribution with two parameters when the available observations are described by means of fuzzy information.	We derive the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters by using Newton Raphson as well as EM algorithm method.

doc	The Einstein@Home Gamma-ray Pulsar Survey. I. Search Methods, Sensitivity and Discovery of New Young Gamma-ray Pulsars EOS We report on the results of a recent blind search survey for gamma-ray pulsars in Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data being carried out on the distributed volunteer computing system, Einstein@Home. EOS The survey has searched for pulsations in 118 unidentified pulsar-like sources, requiring about 10,000 years of CPU core time. EOS In total, this survey has resulted in the discovery of 17 new gamma-ray pulsars, of which 13 are newly reported in this work, and an accompanying paper. EOS These pulsars are all young, isolated pulsars with characteristic ages between 12 kyr and 2 Myr, and spin-down powers between _EQN_ and _EQN_ erg/s. EOS Two of these are the slowest spinning gamma-ray pulsars yet known. EOS One pulsar experienced a very large glitch _EQN_ during the Fermi mission. EOS In this, the first of two associated papers, we describe the search scheme used in this survey, and estimate the sensitivity of our search to pulsations in unidentified Fermi-LAT sources.	One such estimate results in an upper limit of 57% for the fraction of pulsed emission from the gamma-ray source associated with the Cas A supernova remnant, constraining the pulsed gamma-ray photon flux that can be produced by the neutron star at its center.
doc	Detailed Abundances in the Ultra-faint Magellanic Satellites Carina II and III EOS We present the first detailed elemental abundances in the ultra-faint Magellanic satellite galaxies Carina II (Car II) and Carina III (Car III). EOS With high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy, we determined abundances of nine stars in Car II including the first abundances of an RR Lyrae star in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy; EOS and two stars in Car III. EOS The chemical abundances demonstrate that both systems are clearly galaxies and not globular clusters. EOS The stars in these galaxies mostly display abundance trends matching those of other similarly faint dwarf galaxies: enhanced but declining [alpha/Fe] ratios, iron-peak elements matching the stellar halo, and unusually low neutron-capture element abundances. EOS One star displays a low outlying [Sc/Fe] = -1.0. EOS We detect a large Ba scatter in Car II, likely due to inhomogeneous enrichment by low-mass AGB star winds. EOS The most striking abundance trend is for [Mg/Ca] in Car II, which decreases from +0.4 to -0.4 and indicates clear variation in the initial progenitor masses of enriching core-collapse supernovae. EOS So far, the only ultra-faint dwarf galaxies displaying a similar [Mg/Ca] trend are likely satellites of the Large Magellanic Cloud.	We find two stars with [Fe/H] < -3.5, whose abundances likely trace the first generation of metal-free Population III stars and are well-fit by Population III core-collapse supernova yields.
doc	Sidewall quantum wires on GaAs(001) substrates EOS We study the structural, optical, and transport properties of sidewall quantum wires on GaAs(001) substrates. EOS The QWRs are grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on GaAs(001) substrates prepatterned with shallow ridges. EOS They form as a consequence of material accumulation on the sidewalls of the ridges during the overgrowth of a quantum well (QW) on the patterned surface. EOS The QWRs are approximately 200 nm-wide and have emission energies red-shifted by 27meV with respect to the surrounding QW. EOS Spatially resolved spectroscopic photoluminencence studies indicate that the QW thickness reduces around the QWRs, thus creating a 4 meV energy barrier for the transfer of carriers from the QW to the QWR.	We show that the QWRs act as efficient channels for the transport of optically excited electrons and holes over tens of \mu m by a high-frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW).
doc	The Pendulum Arrangement: Maximizing the Escape Time of Heterogeneous Random Walks EOS We identify a fundamental phenomenon of heterogeneous one dimensional random walks: the escape (traversal) time is maximized when the heterogeneity in transition probabilities forms a pyramid-like potential barrier. EOS This barrier corresponds to a distinct arrangement of transition probabilities, sometimes referred to as the pendulum arrangement.	We reduce this problem to a sum over products, combinatorial optimization problem, proving that this unique structure always maximizes the escape time.
doc	Hydrodynamics Across a Fluctuating Interface EOS Understanding what happens inside the rippling and dancing surface of a liquid remains one of the great challenges of fluid dynamics. EOS Using molecular dynamics (MD) we can pick apart the interface structure and understand surface tension. EOS In this work we derive an exact mechanical formulation of hydrodynamics for a liquid-vapour interface using a control volume which moves with the surface. EOS This mathematical framework provides the local definition of hydrodynamic fluxes at any point on the surface. EOS These are represented not only by the flux of molecules and intermolecular interactions acting across the surface, but also as a result of the instantaneous local curvature and movement of the surface itself. EOS By explicitly including the surface dynamics in the equations of motion, we demonstrate an exact balance between kinetic and configurational pressure normal to the surface.	The hydrodynamic analysis makes no assumptions regarding the probability distribution function, so is valid for any system arbitrarily far from thermodynamic equilibrium.
doc	Heavy Quarks from QCD Spectral Sum Rules EOS This is a short review of the present status of the dynamics of the heavy quarks extracted from QCD spectral sum rules.	We discuss the determination of the ``perturbative" quark mass, the decay constants of the _EQN_ and _EQN_ mesons, the form factors of the semileptonic and radiative decays of the _EQN_ mesons, the slope of the Isgur--Wise function and the emerged value of _EQN_.

doc	Configuration spaces of an embedding torus and cubical spaces EOS For a smooth manifold M obtained as an embedding torus, A U Cx[-1,1], we consider the ordered configuration space F_k(M) of k distinct points in M. EOS We show that there is a homotopical cubical resolution of F_k(M) defined from the configuration spaces of A and C.	From it, we deduce a universal method for the computation of the pure braid groups of a manifold.
doc	The Outer Shock of the Oxygen-Rich Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8: Evidence for the Interaction with the Stellar Winds from its Massive Progenitor EOS We study the outer-shock structure of the oxygen-rich supernova remnant G292.0+1.8, using a deep observation with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. EOS We measure radial variations of the electron temperature and emission measure that we identify as the outer shock propagating into a medium with a radially decreasing density profile. EOS The inferred ambient density structure is consistent with models for the circumstellar wind of a massive progenitor star rather than for a uniform interstellar medium. EOS The estimated wind density n_H = 0.1 ~ 0.3 cm^-3) at the current outer radius (~7.7 pc) of the remnant is consistent with a slow wind from a red supergiant (RSG) star.	The total mass of the wind is estimated to be ~ 15 - 40 solar mass (depending on the estimated density range), assuming that the wind extended down to near the surface of the progenitor.
doc	Direct Photons at RHIC EOS Direct photons are ideal tools to investigate kinematical and thermodynamical conditions of heavy ion collisions since they are emitted from all stages of the collision and once produced they leave the interaction region without further modification by the medium. EOS The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured direct photon production in p+p and Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV over a wide transverse momentum (_EQN_) range. EOS The _EQN_ + _EQN_ measurements allow a fundamental test of QCD, and serve as a baseline when we try to disentangle more complex mechanisms producing high _EQN_ direct photons in Au+Au.	As for thermal photons in Au+Au we overcome the difficulties due to the large background from hadronic decays by measuring "almost real" virtual photons which appear as low invariant mass _EQN_ pairs: a significant excess of direct photons is measured above the above next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations.

EOS We report about the experimental setup and progress in obtaining new results for the radiative capture reactions pi-p-->gn and K-p-->gL,charge exchange pi-p-->pi0n,two pi0 production pi-p-->pi0pi0n, and eta production pi-p-->eta n reactions. EOS Data have also been obtained on the decays of N*, Delta, Lambda, and Sigma resonances. EOS Threshold eta production has been studied in detail for both pi-p and K-p.	Sequential resonance decays have been investigated bystudying the 2pi0 production mechanism both in the fundamental interaction and in nuclei.
doc	Quantum algorithm for calculating molecular vibronic spectra EOS We present a quantum algorithm for calculating the vibronic spectrum of a molecule, a useful but classically hard problem in chemistry. EOS We show several advantages over previous quantum approaches: vibrational anharmonicity is naturally included; EOS after measurement, some state information is preserved for further analysis; EOS and there are potential error-related benefits. EOS Considering four triatomic molecules, we numerically study truncation errors in the harmonic approximation.	Further, in order to highlight the fact that our quantum algorithm's primary advantage over classical algorithms is in simulating anharmonic spectra, we consider the anharmonic vibronic spectrum of sulfur dioxide.

doc	L^p change of variables inequalities on manifolds EOS We prove two-sided inequalities for the _EQN_ -norm of a pushforward or pullback (with respect to an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism) on oriented volume and Riemannian manifolds. EOS For a function or density on a volume manifold, these bounds depend only on the Jacobian determinant, which arises through the change of variables theorem.	For an arbitrary differential form on a Riemannian manifold, however, these bounds are shown to depend on more general "spectral" properties of the diffeomorphism, using an appropriately-defined notion of singular values.
doc	Ascent Properties for Test Modules EOS We investigate modules for which vanishing of Tor-modules implies finiteness of homological dimensions (e.g., projective dimension and G-dimension).

doc	Reconfiguration over tree decompositions EOS A vertex-subset graph problem _EQN_ defines which subsets of the vertices of an input graph are feasible solutions. EOS The reconfiguration version of a vertex-subset problem _EQN_ asks whether it is possible to transform one feasible solution for _EQN_ into another in at most _EQN_ steps, where each step is a vertex addition or deletion, and each intermediate set is also a feasible solution for _EQN_ of size bounded by _EQN_. EOS Motivated by recent results establishing W-hardness of the reconfiguration versions of most vertex-subset problems parameterized by _EQN_, we investigate the complexity of such problems restricted to graphs of bounded treewidth.	We show that the reconfiguration versions of most vertex-subset problems remain PSPACE-complete on graphs of treewidth at most _EQN_ but are fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by _EQN_ for all vertex-subset problems definable in monadic second-order logic (MSOL).
doc	Fenchel-Nielsen Coordinates for Maximal Representations EOS We develop Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for representations of surface groups into Sp(2n,R) with maximal Toledo invariant.	Analogous to classical Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on the Teichm\"uller space they consist of a parametrization of representations of the fundamental group of a pair of pants and a careful investigation of the gluing.

doc	Tracy-Widom distributions for the Gaussian orthogonal and symplectic ensembles revisited: a skew-orthogonal polynomials approach EOS We study the distribution of the largest eigenvalue in the "Pfaffian" classical ensembles of random matrix theory, namely in the Gaussian orthogonal (GOE) and Gaussian symplectic (GSE) ensembles, using semi-classical skew-orthogonal polynomials, in analogue to the approach of Nadal and Majumdar (NM) for the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). EOS Generalizing the techniques of Adler, Forrester, Nagao and van Moerbeke, and using "overlapping Pfaffian" identities due to Knuth, we explicitly construct these semi-classical skew-orthogonal polynomials in terms of the semi-classical orthogonal polynomials studied by NM in the case of the GUE. EOS With these polynomials we obtain expressions for the cumulative distribution functions of the largest eigenvalue in the GOE and the GSE.	Further, by performing asymptotic analysis of these skew-orthogonal polynomials in the limit of large matrix size, we obtain an alternative derivation of the Tracy-Widom distributions for GOE and GSE.
doc	Optimal existence classes and nonlinear--like dynamics in the linear heat equation in _EQN_ EOS We analyse the behaviour of solutions of the linear heat equation in _EQN_ for initial data in the classes _EQN_ of Radon measures with _EQN_. EOS We show that these classes are in some sense optimal for local and global existence of non-negative solutions: in particular _EQN_ consists precisely of those initial data for which the a solution of the heat equation can be given for all time using the heat kernel representation formula. EOS After considering properties of existence, uniqueness, and regularity for such initial data, which can grow rapidly at infinity, we go on to show that they give rise to properties associated more often with nonlinear models.	We demonstrate the finite-time blowup of solutions, showing that the set of blowup points is the complement of a convex set, and that given any closed convex set there is an initial condition whose solutions remain bounded precisely on this set at the `blowup time'.
doc	A Message Passing Approach for Multiple Maneuvering Target Tracking EOS This paper considers the problem of detecting and tracking multiple maneuvering targets, which suffers from the intractable inference of high-dimensional latent variables that include target kinematic state, target visibility state, motion mode-model association, and data association. EOS A unified message passing algorithm that combines belief propagation (BP) and mean-field (MF) approximation is proposed for simplifying the intractable inference. EOS By assuming conjugate-exponential priors for target kinematic state, target visibility state, and motion mode-model association, the MF approximation decouples the joint inference of target kinematic state, target visibility state, motion mode-model association into individual low-dimensional inference, yielding simple message passing update equations. EOS The BP is exploited to approximate the probabilities of data association events since it is compatible with hard constraints.	Finally, the approximate posterior probability distributions are updated iteratively in a closed-loop manner, which is effective for dealing with the coupling issue between the estimations of target kinematic state and target visibility state and decisions on motion mode-model association and data association.
doc	Vertex corrections in localized and extended systems EOS Within many-body perturbation theory we apply vertex corrections to various closed-shell atoms and to jellium, using a local approximation for the vertex consistent with starting the many-body perturbation theory from a DFT-LDA Green's function. EOS The vertex appears in two places -- in the screened Coulomb interaction, W, and in the self-energy, \Sigma -- and we obtain a systematic discrimination of these two effects by turning the vertex in \Sigma on and off. EOS We also make comparisons to standard GW results within the usual random-phase approximation (RPA), which omits the vertex from both. EOS When a vertex is included for closed-shell atoms, both ground-state and excited-state properties demonstrate only limited improvements over standard GW.	For jellium we observe marked improvement in the quasiparticle band width when the vertex is included only in W, whereas turning on the vertex in \Sigma leads to an unphysical quasiparticle dispersion and work function.

doc	Dependence of inclusive jet production on the anti- _EQN_ distance parameter in pp collisions at _EQN_ 13 TeV EOS The dependence of inclusive jet production in proton-proton collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV on the distance parameter _EQN_ of the anti- _EQN_ algorithm is studied using data corresponding to integrated luminosities up to 35.9 fb _EQN_ collected by the CMS experiment in 2016. EOS The ratios of the inclusive cross sections as functions of transverse momentum _EQN_ and rapidity _EQN_, for _EQN_ in the range 0.1 to 1.2 to those using _EQN_ 0.4 are presented in the region 84 _EQN_ 1588 GeV and _EQN_ 2.0. EOS The results are compared to calculations at leading and next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant using different parton shower models.	The variation of the ratio of cross sections with _EQN_ is well described by calculations including a parton shower model, but not by a leading-order quantum chromodynamics calculation including nonperturbative effects.
doc	Towards Partial Compositeness on the Lattice: Baryons with Fermions in Multiple Representations EOS We describe our recent lattice study of SU(4) gauge theory with fermions in the fundamental and sextet representations.

The spectrum of these "chimera baryons" has a straightforward interpretation in terms of a non-relativistic quark model based on SU(4).
doc	Transform\'ee en scattering sur la spirale temps-chroma-octave EOS We introduce a scattering representation for the analysis and classification of sounds.

doc	Searches for Dark Matter at the LHC in forward proton mode EOS We analyze in detail the LHC prospects at the center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV for charged electroweakino searches, decaying to leptons, in compressed supersymmetry scenarios, via exclusive photon-initiated pair production. EOS This provides a potentially increased sensitivity in comparison to inclusive channels, where the background is often overwhelming. EOS We pay particular attention to the challenges that such searches would face in the hostile high pile-up environment of the LHC, giving close consideration to the backgrounds that will be present. EOS The signal we focus on is the exclusive production of same-flavour muon and electron pairs, with missing energy in the final state, and with two outgoing intact protons registered by the dedicated forward proton detectors installed in association with ATLAS and CMS. EOS We present results for slepton masses of 120--300 GeV and slepton-neutralino mass splitting of 10-20 GeV, and find that the relevant backgrounds can be controlled to the level of the expected signal yields.	The most significant such backgrounds are due to semi-exclusive lepton pair production at lower masses, with a proton produced in the initial proton dissociation system registering in the forward detectors, and from the coincidence of forward protons produced in pile-up events with an inclusive central event that mimics the signal.

doc	Density response of cuprates and renormalization of breathing phonons EOS We analyse the dynamical density fluctuation spectra for cuprates starting from the _EQN_ model in a slave-boson 1/N representation. EOS The results obtained are consistent with diagonalization studies and show novel low-energy structure on the energy scale _EQN_ due to the correlated motion of holes in a RVB spin liquid.	The low-energy response implies an anomalous renormalization of several phonon modes.
doc	Large-scale environments of binary AGB stars probed by Herschel - I. Morphology statistics and case studies of R Aquarii and W Aquilae EOS The Mass loss of Evolved StarS (MESS) sample offers a selection of 78 Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and Red Supergiants (RSGs) observed with the PACS photometer on-board Herschel at 70 and 160 \mu m. EOS For most of these objects, the dusty AGB wind differs from spherical symmetry and the wind shape can be subdivided into four classes. EOS In the present paper we concentrate on the influence of a companion on the morphology of the stellar wind. EOS Literature was searched to find binaries in the MESS sample and these are subsequently linked to their wind-morphology class to assert that the binaries are not distributed equally among the classes. EOS In the second part of the paper we concentrate on the circumstellar environment of the two prominent objects R Aqr and W Aql. EOS Each shows a characteristic signature of a companion interaction with the stellar wind. EOS For the symbiotic star R Aqr, PACS revealed two perfectly opposing arms which in part reflect the previously observed ring-shaped nebula in the optical. EOS However, from the far-IR there is evidence that the emitting region is elliptical rather than circular.	The outline of the wind of W Aql seems to follow a large Archimedean spiral formed by the orbit of the companion but also shows strong indications of an interaction with the interstellar medium.
doc	Strong CP Violation in External Magnetic Fields EOS We study the response of the QCD vacuum to an external magnetic field, in the presence of strong CP violation. EOS Using chiral perturbation theory and large N_c expansion, we show that the external field would polarize quantum fluctuations and induce an electric dipole moment of the vacuum, along the direction of the magnetic field. EOS We estimate the magnitude of this effect in different physical scenarios.	In particular, we find that the polarization induced by the magnetic field of a magnetar could accelerate electric charges up to energies of the order \theta 10^3 TeV.
doc	BeppoSAX observations of three distant, highly luminous clusters of galaxies: RXJ1347-1145, Z3146 and A2390 EOS We present an analysis of BeppoSAX observations of three clusters of galaxies which are amongst the most luminous in the Universe: RXJ1347-1145, Zwicky 3146 and Abell 2390. EOS Using data from both the Low Energy (LECS) and Medium Energy (MECS) Concentrator Spectrometers, and a joint analysis with the Phoswich Detection System (PDS) data above 10 keV, we constrain, with a relative uncertainty of between 7 and 42 per cent (90 per cent confidence level), the mean gas temperature in the three clusters. EOS These measurements are checked against any possible non-thermal contribution to the plasma emission and are shown to be robust. EOS We confirm that RXJ1347-1145 has a gas temperature that lies in the range between 13.2 and 22.3 keV at the 90 per cent confidence level, and is larger than 12.1 keV at 3 sigma level.	The existence of such a hot galaxy cluster at redshift of about 0.45 implies an upper limit on the mean mass density in the Universe, Omega_m, of 0.5.
doc	Time-resolved optical observations of five cataclysmic variables detected by INTEGRAL EOS The ESA gamma-ray telescope, INTEGRAL, is detecting relatively more intrinsically rare cataclysmic variables (CVs) than were found by surveys at lower energies. EOS Specifically, a large fraction of the CVs that are INTEGRAL sources consists of asynchronous polars and intermediate polars (IPs). EOS IP classifications have been proposed for the majority of CVs discovered by INTEGRAL, but, in many cases, there is very little known about these systems. EOS In order to address this, I present time-resolved optical data of five CVs discovered through INTEGRAL observations.	The white dwarf spin modulation is detected in high-speed photometry of three of the new CVs (IGR J15094-6649, IGR J16500-3307, and IGR J17195-4100), but two others (XSS J12270-4859 and IGR J16167-4957) show no evidence of magnetism, and should be considered unclassified systems.

doc	Discord and information deficit in the XX chain EOS We examine the quantum correlations of spin pairs in the cyclic _EQN_ spin 1/2 chain in a transverse field, through the analysis of the quantum discord, the geometric discord and the information deficit. EOS It is shown that while these quantities provide the same qualitative information, being non-zero for all temperatures and separations and exhibiting the same type of asymptotic behavior for large temperatures or separations, important differences arise in the minimizing local measurement that defines them. EOS Whereas the quantum discord prefers a spin measurement perpendicular to the transverse field, the geometric discord and information deficit exhibit a perpendicular to parallel transition as the field increases, which subsists at all temperatures and for all separations.	Moreover, it is shown that such transition signals the change from a Bell state to an aligned separable state of the dominant eigenstate of the reduced density matrix of the pair.
doc	Probing new physics in B -> phi pi decay EOS We analyze the rare decay mode _EQN_, which is a pure penguin induced process, receiving dominant contribution from the electroweak penguins. EOS Thus the standard model branching ratio is expected to be very small, which makes it as a sensitive probe of new physics. EOS Using QCD factorization approach, we find the branching ratio in the standard model as _EQN_. EOS Exploring some of the beyond standard model scenarios the branching ratio is found to be _EQN_ in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with mass insertion approximation and in the extended technicolor model (TC2).	The existence of an extra vector-like down quark (VLDQ) model predicts it to be _EQN_.
doc	A Parameterization of D equivalences of coherent sheaves of symplectic resolutions of a given symplectic singularity EOS Let G be a reductive groups over an algebraically closed field k. EOS Let P^ (i) be associated parabolic subgroups, and X^ (i):=T^*G/P^i. EOS The bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves on X^ (i) are equivalent, but there is no canonical equivalence.	By refining a construction from a previous paper, we construct a local system of categories over a topological space V^0_C, where these categories are assigned to different points in V^0_C.

doc	Browserbite: Cross-Browser Testing via Image Processing EOS Cross-browser compatibility testing is concerned with identifying perceptible differences in the way a Web page is rendered across different browsers or configurations thereof. EOS Existing automated cross-browser compatibility testing methods are generally based on Document Object Model (DOM) analysis, or in some cases, a combination of DOM analysis with screenshot capture and image processing. EOS DOM analysis however may miss incompatibilities that arise not during DOM construction, but rather during rendering. EOS Conversely, DOM analysis produces false alarms because different DOMs may lead to identical or sufficiently similar renderings. EOS This paper presents a novel method for cross-browser testing based purely on image processing. EOS The method relies on image segmentation to extract regions from a Web page and computer vision techniques to extract a set of characteristic features from each region. EOS Regions extracted from a screenshot taken on a baseline browser are compared against regions extracted from the browser under test based on characteristic features.	A machine learning classifier is used to determine if differences between two matched regions should be classified as an incompatibility.
doc	Prospects for R-Parity Conserving SUSY searches at the LHC EOS We review the current strategies to search for generic SUSY models with R-parity conservation in the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC.

We will also describe the search for models of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking for which the NLSP is a neutralino decaying to a photon and a gravitino.
doc	Holographic Plasmons EOS Since holography yields exact results, even in situations where perturbation theory is not applicable, it is an ideal framework for modeling strongly correlated systems.

doc	LU-Net: a multi-task network to improve the robustness of segmentation of left ventriclular structures by deep learning in 2D echocardiography EOS Segmentation of cardiac structures is one of the fundamental steps to estimate volumetric indices of the heart. EOS This step is still performed semi-automatically in clinical routine, and is thus prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. EOS Recent studies have shown that deep learning has the potential to perform fully automatic segmentation. EOS However, the current best solutions still suffer from a lack of robustness. EOS In this work, we introduce an end-to-end multi-task network designed to improve the overall accuracy of cardiac segmentation while enhancing the estimation of clinical indices and reducing the number of outliers. EOS Results obtained on a large open access dataset show that our method outperforms the current best performing deep learning solution and achieved an overall segmentation accuracy lower than the intra-observer variability for the epicardial border (i.e. EOS on average a mean absolute error of 1.5mm and a Hausdorff distance of 5.1mm) with 11% of outliers. EOS Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can closely reproduce the expert analysis for the end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes, with a mean correlation of 0.96 and a mean absolute error of 7.6ml.	Concerning the ejection fraction of the left ventricle, results are more contrasted with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.83 and an absolute mean error of 5.0%, producing scores that are slightly below the intra-observer margin.
doc	Epigenetic regulation of repetitive DNA through mitotic asynchrony following double fertilization in angiosperms EOS Several recent studies show that companion cells in flowering plant gametophytes relax epigenetic control of transposable elements (TEs) to promote production of small RNA that presumably assist nearby reproductive cells in management of TEs. EOS In light of this possibility, a closer look at the timing of cell division in relation to angiosperm double fertilization is warranted. EOS From such an analysis, it is conceivable that double fertilization can drive angiosperm evolution by facilitating crosses between genetically diverse parents. EOS A key feature of this ability is the order of cell division following double fertilization, since division of the primary endosperm nucleus prior to the zygote would produce small RNA capable of identifying TEs and defining chromatin states in the zygote prior to its entry into S-phase of the cell cycle.	Consequently, crosses leading to increased ploidy or between genetically diverse parents would yield offspring better capable of managing a diverse complement of TEs and repetitive DNA.
doc	Magneto-Infrared Spectroscopic Study of Ultrathin Bi _EQN_ Te _EQN_ Single Crystals EOS Ultrathin Bi _EQN_ Te _EQN_ single crystals laid on Scotch tape are investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy at _EQN_ K and in a magnetic field up to _EQN_ T. EOS The magneto-transmittance spectra of the Bi _EQN_ % Te _EQN_ /tape composite are analyzed as a two-layer system and the optical conductivity of Bi _EQN_ Te _EQN_ at different magnetic fields are extracted. EOS We find that magnetic field modifies the optical conductivity in the following ways: (1) Field-induced transfer of the optical weight from the lower frequency regime (_EQN_ cm _EQN_) to the higher frequency regime (_EQN_ cm _EQN_) due to the redistribution of charge carriers across the Fermi surface. EOS (2) Evolving of a Fano-resonance-like spectral feature from an anti-resonance to a resonance with increasing magnetic field.	Such behavior can be attributed to the electron-phonon interactions between the _EQN_ optical phonon mode and the continuum of electronic transitions.
doc	Consistency of LCDM with Geometric and Dynamical Probes EOS The LCDM cosmological model assumes the existence of a small cosmological constant in order to explain the observed accelerating cosmic expansion. EOS Despite the dramatic improvement of the quality of cosmological data during the last decade it remains the simplest model that fits remarkably well (almost) all cosmological observations. EOS In this talk I review the increasingly successful fits provided by LCDM on recent geometric probe data of the cosmic expansion. EOS I also briefly discuss some emerging shortcomings of the model in attempting to fit specific classes of data (eg cosmic velocity dipole flows and cluster halo profiles).	Finally, I summarize recent results on the theoretically predicted matter overdensity (_EQN_) evolution (a dynamical probe of the cosmic expansion), emphasizing its scale and gauge dependence on large cosmological scales in the context of general relativity.

EOS The configurations are generated with the stout-smeared _EQN_ -improved Wilson quark action and the Iwasaki gauge action at _EQN_ =1.82. EOS The pion mass at the simulation point is about 146 MeV. EOS A large spatial volume of _EQN_ allows us to investigate the form factors in the small momentum transfer region.	We determine the isovector electric radius and magnetic moment from nucleon electric (_EQN_) and magnetic (_EQN_) form factors as well as the axial-vector coupling _EQN_.
doc	Electronic Structure, Surface Doping, and Optical Response in Epitaxial WSe2 Thin Films EOS High quality WSe2 films have been grown on bilayer graphene (BLG) with layer-by-layer control of thickness using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). EOS The combination of angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and optical absorption measurements reveal the atomic and electronic structures evolution and optical response of WSe2/BLG. EOS We observe that a bilayer of WSe2 is a direct bandgap semiconductor, when integrated in a BLG-based heterostructure, thus shifting the direct-indirect band gap crossover to trilayer WSe2. EOS In the monolayer limit, WSe2 shows a spin-splitting of 475 meV in the valence band at the K point, the largest value observed among all the MX2 (M = Mo, W; EOS X = S, Se) materials.	The exciton binding energy of monolayer-WSe2/BLG is found to be 0.21 eV, a value that is orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional 3D semiconductors, yet small as compared to other 2D transition metal dichalcogennides (TMDCs) semiconductors.
doc	Simulations of Magnetically-Driven Supernova and Hypernova Explosions in the Context of Rapid Rotation EOS We present here the first 2D rotating, multi-group, radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of supernova core collapse, bounce, and explosion. EOS In the context of rapid rotation, we focus on the dynamical effects of magnetic stresses and the creation and propagation of MHD jets. EOS We find that a quasi-steady state can be quickly established after bounce, during which a well-collimated MHD jet is maintained by continuous pumping of power from the differentially rotating core. EOS If the initial spin period of the progenitor core is _EQN_ 2 seconds, the free energy reservoir in the secularly evolving protoneutron star is adequate to power a supernova explosion, and may be enough for a hypernova. EOS The jets are well collimated by the infalling material and magnetic hoop stresses, and maintain a small opening angle. EOS We see evidence of sausage instabilities in the emerging jet stream. EOS Neutrino heating is sub-dominant in the rapidly rotating models we explore, but can contribute 10 _EQN_ 25% to the final explosion energy. EOS Our simulations suggest that even in the case of modest or slow rotation, a supernova explosion might be followed by a secondary, weak MHD jet explosion, which, because of its weakness may to date have gone unnoticed in supernova debris.	Furthermore, we suggest that the generation of a non-relativistic MHD precursor jet during the early protoneutron star/supernova phase is implicit in both the collapsar and "millisecond magnetar" models of GRBs.
doc	A full vectorial mapping of nanophotonic light fields EOS Light is a union of electric and magnetic fields, and nowhere is their complex relationship more evident than in the near fields of nanophotonic structures. EOS There, complicated electric and magnetic fields varying over subwavelength scales are generally present, leading to photonic phenomena such as extraordinary optical momentum, super-chiral fields, and a complex spatial evolution of optical singularities. EOS An understanding of such phenomena requires nanoscale measurements of the complete optical field vector. EOS However, while it was recently demonstrated that near-field scanning optical microscopy is sensitive to the complete electromagnetic field, a separation of the different components required a priori knowledge of the sample. EOS Here we introduce a robust algorithm that can disentangle all six electric and magnetic field components from a single near-field measurement, without any numerical modeling of the structure.	As examples, we unravel the fields of two prototypical nanophotonic structures: a photonic crystal waveguide and a plasmonic nanowire.

doc	Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation for Explaining Deep Neural Network Decisions in MRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Classification EOS Deep neural networks have led to state-of-the-art results in many medical imaging tasks including Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. EOS However, the network decisions are often perceived as being highly non-transparent, making it difficult to apply these algorithms in clinical routine. EOS In this study, we propose using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize convolutional neural network decisions for AD based on MRI data. EOS Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP produces a heatmap in the input space indicating the importance/relevance of each voxel contributing to the final classification outcome. EOS In contrast to susceptibility maps produced by guided backpropagation ("Which change in voxels would change the outcome most? EOS "), the LRP method is able to directly highlight positive contributions to the network classification in the input space. EOS In particular, we show that (1) the LRP method is very specific for individuals ("Why does this person have AD? EOS ") with high inter-patient variability, (2) there is very little relevance for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that exhibit a lot of relevance correlate well with what is known from literature. EOS To quantify the latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed relevance per brain area, e.g., relevance density or relevance gain.	Although these metrics produce very individual "fingerprints" of relevance patterns for AD patients, a lot of importance is put on areas in the temporal lobe including the hippocampus.
doc	Can D-Branes Wrap Nonrepresentable Cycles? EOS Sometimes a homology cycle of a nonsingular compactification manifold cannot be represented by a nonsingular submanifold. EOS We want to know whether such nonrepresentable cycles can be wrapped by D-branes. EOS A brane wrapping a representable cycle carries a K-theory charge if and only if its Freed-Witten anomaly vanishes. EOS However some K-theory charges are only carried by branes that wrap nonrepresentable cycles. EOS We provide two examples of Freed-Witten anomaly-free D6-branes wrapping nonrepresentable cycles in the presence of a trivial NS 3-form flux.	The first occurs in type IIA string theory compactified on the Sp(2) group manifold and the second in IIA on a product of lens spaces.
doc	Search for _EQN_ -parity violating supersymmetry in pp collisions at _EQN_ 13 TeV using b jets in a final state with a single lepton, many jets, and high sum of large-radius jet masses EOS Results are reported from a search for physics beyond the standard model in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of _EQN_ 13 TeV. EOS The search uses a signature of a single lepton, large jet and bottom quark jet multiplicities, and high sum of large-radius jet masses, without any requirement on the missing transverse momentum in an event. EOS The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb _EQN_ recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. EOS No significant excess beyond the prediction from standard model processes is observed.	The results are interpreted in terms of upper limits on the production cross section for _EQN_ -parity violating supersymmetric extensions of the standard model using a benchmark model of gluino pair production, in which each gluino decays promptly via _EQN_.
doc	Absorbing phase transitions in deterministic fixed-energy sandpile models EOS We investigate the origin of the difference, which was noticed by Fey et al [Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS 104, 145703 (2010)], between the steady state density of an Abelian sandpile model (ASM) and the transition point of its corresponding deterministic fixed-energy sandpile model (DFES). EOS Being deterministic, the configuration space of a DFES can be divided into two disjoint classes such that every configuration in one class should evolve into one of absorbing states, whereas no configurations in the other class can reach an absorbing state. EOS Since the two classes are separated in terms of toppling dynamics, the system can be made to exhibit an absorbing phase transition (APT) at various points that depend on the initial probability distribution of the configurations. EOS Furthermore, we show that in general the transition point also depends on whether an infinite-size limit is taken before or after the infinite-time limit. EOS To demonstrate, we numerically study the two-dimensional DFES with Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld toppling rule (BTW-FES). EOS We confirm that there are indeed many thresholds. EOS Nonetheless, the critical phenomena at various transition points are found to be universal.	We furthermore discuss a microscopic absorbing phase transition, or a so-called spreading dynamics, of the BTW-FES, to find that the phase transition in this setting is related to the dynamical isotropic percolation process rather than self-organized criticality.
doc	Normalization in Lie algebras via mould calculus and applications EOS We establish Ecalle's mould calculus in an abstract Lie-theoretic setting and use it to solve a normalization problem, which covers several formal normal form problems in the theory of dynamical systems. EOS The mould formalism allows us to reduce the Lie-theoretic problem to a mould equation, the solutions of which are remarkably explicit and can be fully described by means of a gauge transformation group.	The dynamical applications include the construction of Poincar \'e -Dulac formal normal forms for a vector field around an equilibrium point, a formal infinite-order multiphase averaging procedure for vector fields with fast angular variables (Hamiltonian or not), or the construction of Birkhoff normal forms both in classical and quantum situations.

EOS For this sample, we obtained median contrasts of \Delta H=13.9 mag at 1" in combined CH4 narrowband ADI+SDI mode and median contrasts of \Delta H=15.1 mag at 2" in H-band ADI mode. EOS We found numerous (>70) candidate companions in our survey images. EOS Some of these candidates were rejected as common-proper motion companions using archival data; EOS we reobserved with NICI all other candidates that lay within 400 AU of the star and were not in dense stellar fields. EOS The vast majority of candidate companions were confirmed as background objects from archival observations and/or dedicated NICI campaign followup.	Four co-moving companions of brown dwarf or stellar mass were discovered in this moving group sample: PZ Tel B (36+-6 MJup, 16.4+-1.0 AU, Biller et al 2010), CD -35 2722B (31+-8 MJup, 67+-4 AU, Wahhaj et al 2011), HD 12894B (0.46+-0.08 MSun, 15.7+-1.0 AU), and BD+07 1919C (0.20+-0.03 MSun, 12.5+-1.4 AU).
doc	Flavour models with Dirac and fake gluinos EOS In the context of supersymmetric models where the gauginos may have both Majorana and Dirac masses we investigate the general constraints from flavour-changing processes on the scalar mass matrices. EOS One finds that the chirality-flip suppression of flavour-changing effects usually invoked in the pure Dirac case holds in the mass insertion approximation but not in the general case, and fails in particular for inverted hierarchy models.	We quantify the constraints in several flavour models which correlate fermion and scalar superpartner masses.
doc	Topological Hopf algebras, quantum groups and deformation quantization	After a presentation of the context and a brief reminder of deformation quantization, we indicate how the introduction of natural topological vector space topologies on Hopf algebras associated with Poisson Lie groups, Lie bialgebras and their doubles explains their dualities and provides a comprehensive framework.
doc	Theory and Phenomenology of Dirac Leptogenesis EOS Dirac leptogenesis, in which neutrinos are purely Dirac and develop small but nonzero effective masses without the aid of the see-saw mechanism, provides an interesting alternative to the standard leptogenesis picture. EOS Here we review the theory and phenomenology of Dirac leptogenesis and show that it is a viable theory capable of simultaneously satisfying all relevant bounds from cosmology, neutrino physics, and flavor violation. EOS In addition, we also explore several potential extensions of the model, such as the possibility of right-handed sneutrino dark matter and the potential for relating the leptogenesis mechanism to the origin of the mu-term. EOS Theories with a heavy gravitino and gaugino masses generated by anomaly mediation emerge as one natural context for Dirac leptogenesis.	In such models the lightest neutralino is often expected to be predominately wino or Higgsino, and is a viable dark matter candidate.

doc	Microscopic and macroscopic properties of A-superstatistics EOS The microscopic and the macroscopic properties of A-superstatistics, related to the class A(0,n-1)\equiv sl(1|n) of simple Lie superalgebras are investigated. EOS The algebra sl(1|n) is described in terms of generators f_1^\pm, >..., f_n^\pm, which satisfy certain triple relations and are called Jacobson generators. EOS The Fock spaces of A-superstatistics are investigated and the Pauli principle of the corresponding statistics is formulated. EOS Some thermal properties of A-superstatistics are constructed under the assumption that the particles interact only via statistical interaction imposed by the Pauli principle.	The grand partition function and the average number of particles are written down explicitly in the general case and in two particular examples: 1) the particles have one and the same energy and chemical potential;
doc	Revisiting the Hamiltonian Theme in the Square of a Block: The Case of DT-Graphs EOS The square of a graph G, denoted G^2, is the graph obtained from G by joining by an edge any two nonadjacent vertices which have a common neighbor. EOS A graph G is said to have the F_k property if for any set of k distinct vertices x_1, x_2,..., x_k in G, there is a hamiltonian path from x_1 to x_2 in G^2 containing k-2 distinct edges of G of the form x_iz_i, i = 3,..., k. EOS It was proved many years ago that every 2-connected graph has the F_3 property.	In the first part of this work, we extend this result by proving that every 2-connected DT-graph has the F_4 property (Theorem 2) and will show in the second part that this generalization holds for arbitrary 2-connected graphs, and that there exist 2-connected graphs which do not have the F_k property for any natural number k >= 5.

We interpret this problem as the Euler equation of a shape optimization problems, we prove existence and regularity of a solution.
doc	Some open problems in the context of skew PBW extensions and semi-graded rings EOS In this paper we discuss some open problems of non-commutative algebra and non-commutative algebraic geometry from the approach of skew _EQN_ extensions and semi-graded rings. EOS More exactly, we will analyze the isomorphism arising in the investigation of the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture about the commutation between the center and the total ring of fractions of an Ore domain. EOS The Serre's conjecture will be discussed for a particular class of skew _EQN_ extensions.	The questions about the noetherianity and the Zariski cancellation property of Artin-Schelter regular algebras will be reformulated for semi-graded rings.
doc	Searching for dark matter and variation of fundamental constants with laser and maser interferometry EOS Any slight variations in the fundamental constants of Nature, which may be induced by dark matter or some yet-to-be-discovered cosmic field, would characteristically alter the phase of a light beam inside an interferometer, which can be measured extremely precisely.	Laser and maser interferometry may be applied to searches for the linear-in-time drift of the fundamental constants, detection of topological defect dark matter through transient-in-time effects and for a relic, coherently oscillating condensate, which consists of scalar dark matter fields, through oscillating effects.
doc	Low-Pass Filters: Commentary on a Remark by Feynman EOS In Feynman's lectures there is a remark about the limiting value of the impedance of an n-section ladder consisting of purely reactive elements (capacitances and inductances). EOS The remark is that this limiting impedance _EQN_ has a positive real part. EOS He notes that this is surprising since the real part of each _EQN_ is zero, therefore it is impossible for the limit to have a positive real part. EOS A recent article in this journal offered an explanation of this paradox based on the fact that realistic impedances have a non-negative real part, but the authors noted that their argument was incomplete.	We use the same physical idea, but give a simple argument which shows that the sequence _EQN_ converges like a geometric series.
doc	The longitudinal polarization of hyperons in the forward region in polarized _EQN_ collisions EOS We study the longitudinal polarization of hyperons and anti-hyperons at forward pseudorapidity, _EQN_, in singly polarized _EQN_ collisions at RHIC energies by using different parameterizations of the polarized parton densities and different models for the polarized fragmentation functions. EOS The results show that the _EQN_ polarization is able to distinguish different pictures on spin transfer in high energy fragmentation processes;	and the polarization of _EQN_ and _EQN_ hyperons can provide sensitivity to the helicity distribution of strange sea quarks.
doc	Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors: physics and applications EOS Single-photon detectors based on superconducting nanowires (SSPDs or SNSPDs) have rapidly emerged as a highly promising photon-counting technology for infrared wavelengths. EOS These devices offer high efficiency, low dark counts and excellent timing resolution. EOS In this review, we consider the basic SNSPD operating principle and models of device behaviour. EOS We give an overview of the evolution of SNSPD device design and the improvements in performance which have been achieved. EOS We also evaluate device limitations and noise mechanisms. EOS We survey practical refrigeration technologies and optical coupling schemes for SNSPDs.	Finally we summarize promising application areas, ranging from quantum cryptography to remote sensing.
doc	Generalized Gaussian processes and relations with random matrices and positive definite functions on permutation groups EOS The main purpose of this paper of the paper is an explicite construction of generalized Gaussian process with function _EQN_, where _EQN_, _EQN_ is the number of singletons in a pair-partition _EQN_. EOS This gives another proof of Theorem of A. EOS Buchholtz REF that _EQN_ is positive definite function on the set of all pair-partitions. EOS Some new combinatorial formulas are also presented.	Connections with free additive convolutions probability measure on _EQN_ are also done.

doc	The X-ray light curve of the massive colliding wind Wolf-Rayet + O binary WR21a EOS Our dedicated XMM-Newton monitoring, as well as archival Chandra and Swift datasets, were used to examine the behaviour of the WN5h+O3V binary WR21a at high energies. EOS For most of the orbit, the X-ray emission exhibits few variations. EOS However, an increase in strength of the emission is seen before periastron, following a 1/D relative trend, where D is the separation between both components. EOS This increase is rapidly followed by a decline due to strong absorption as the Wolf-Rayet (WR) comes in front. EOS The fitted local absorption value appears to be coherent with a mass-loss rate of about 1x10^ -5 M_sol/yr for the WR component. EOS However, absorption is not the only parameter affecting the X-ray emission at periastron as even the hard X-ray emission decreases, suggesting a possible collapse of the colliding wind region near to or onto the photosphere of the companion just before or at periastron. EOS An eclipse may appear as another potential scenario, but it would be in apparent contradiction with several lines of evidence, notably the width of the dip in the X-ray light curve and the absence of variations in the UV light curve.	Afterwards, the emission slowly recovers, with a strong hysteresis effect.
doc	Orientational order in two dimensions from competing interactions at different scales EOS We discuss orientational order in two dimensions in the context of systems with competing isotropic interactions at different scales. EOS We consider an extension of the Brazovskii model for stripe phases including explicitly quartic terms with nematic symmetry in the energy.	We show that leading fluctuations of the mean field nematic solution drive the isotropic-nematic transition into the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class, i.e.

doc	On modular symbols and the cohomology of Hecke triangle surfaces EOS The aim of this article is to give a concise algebraic treatment of the modular symbols formalism, generalised from modular curves to Hecke triangle surfaces. EOS A sketch is included of how the modular symbols formalism gives rise to the standard algorithms for the computation of holomorphic modular forms. EOS Precise and explicit connections are established to the cohomology of Hecke triangle surfaces and group cohomology.	In all the note a general commutative ring is used as coefficient ring in view of applications to the computation of modular forms over rings different from the complex numbers.
doc	Variational study of the flux tube recombination in the two quarks and two quarks system in Lattice QCD EOS The color fields in a system composed by two static quarks and two static antiquarks are studied. EOS In particular, we consider the four particles in the corners of a rectangle, and two possible alignment of the particles, one in which the quarks are at the same side of the rectangle, and the other where they are at opposite sides. EOS We use a variational method, to probe not only the ground state but also the first excited state.	This results permit us to observe and interpret the flux-tube recombination in the mesons to mesons and the tetraquark to mesons transitions, for both states.
doc	Thirty Years of Radio Observations of Type Ia SN 1972E and SN 1895B: Constraints on Circumstellar Shells EOS We have imaged over 35 years of archival Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the nearby (d _EQN_ _EQN_ 3.15 Mpc) Type Ia supernovae SN\,1972E and SN\,1895B between 9 and 121 years post-explosion. EOS No radio emission is detected, constraining the 8.5 GHz luminosities of SN\,1972E and SN\,1895B to be L _EQN_ _EQN_ 6.0 _EQN_ 10 _EQN_ erg s _EQN_ Hz _EQN_ 45 years post-explosion and L _EQN_ _EQN_ 8.9 _EQN_ 10 _EQN_ erg s _EQN_ Hz _EQN_ 121 years post-explosion, respectively. EOS These limits imply a clean circumstellar medium (CSM), with _EQN_ _EQN_ 0.9 cm _EQN_ out to radii of a few _EQN_ 10 _EQN_ cm, if the SN blastwave is expanding into uniform density material. EOS Due to the extensive time coverage of our observations, we also constrain the presence of CSM shells surrounding the progenitor of SN\,1972E. EOS We rule out essentially all medium and thick shells with masses of 0.05 _EQN_ 0.3 M _EQN_ at radii between _EQN_ 10 _EQN_ and 10 _EQN_ cm, and thin shells at specific radii with masses down to _EQN_ 0.01 M _EQN_. EOS These constraints rule out swaths of parameter space for a range of single and double degenerate progenitor scenarios, including recurrent nova, core-degenerate objects, ultra-prompt explosions and white dwarf (WD) mergers with delays of a few hundred years between the onset of merger and explosion.	Allowed progenitors include WD-WD systems with a significant (_EQN_ 10 _EQN_ years) delay from the last episode of common envelope evolution and single degenerate systems undergoing recurrent nova, provided that the recurrence timescale i short and the system has been in the nova phase for _EQN_ 10 _EQN_ yr, such that a large (_EQN_ 10 _EQN_ cm) cavity has been evacuated.
doc	Delay-induced blow-up in a limit-cycle oscillation model EOS It is well-known that time-lags or histories sometimes play a essential role in the phenomena and thus many mathematical model with delay-effects are studied mathematically and numerically. EOS It is also well-known that the delay-effects cause an instability or an oscillatory. EOS In this paper we consider the effects of time-delay for such instabilities from the viewpoint of a finite time blow-up of the solutions and show "delay-induced blow-up" phenomena for a very simple oscillation model with a constant delay.	We also show the emergence of infinity many periodic solutions, while the non-delay system has only one stable limit cycle.

doc	Observational Signatures of Tilted Black Hole Accretion Disks from Simulations EOS Geometrically thick accretion flows may be present in black hole X-ray binaries observed in the low/hard state and in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. EOS Unlike in geometrically thin disks, the angular momentum axis in these sources is not expected to align with the black hole spin axis. EOS We compute images from three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of misaligned (tilted) accretion flows using relativistic radiative transfer, and compare the estimated locations of the radiation edge with expectations from their aligned (untilted) counterparts. EOS The radiation edge in the tilted simulations is independent of black hole spin for a tilt of 15 degrees, in stark contrast to the results for untilted simulations, which agree with the monotonic dependence on spin expected from thin accretion disk theory. EOS Synthetic emission line profiles from the tilted simulations depend strongly on the observer's azimuth, and exhibit unique features such as broad "blue wings." Coupled with precession, the azimuthal variation could generate time fluctuations in observed emission lines, which would be a clear "signature" of a tilted accretion flow.	Finally, we evaluate the possibility that the observed low- and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from black hole binaries could be produced by misaligned accretion flows.
doc	A Fast Incremental BSP Tree Archive for Non-dominated Points EOS Maintaining an archive of all non-dominated points is a standard task in multi-objective optimization. EOS Sometimes it is sufficient to store all evaluated points and to obtain the non-dominated subset in a post-processing step. EOS Alternatively the non-dominated set can be updated on the fly.	While keeping track of many non-dominated points efficiently is easy for two objectives, we propose an efficient algorithm based on a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree for the general case of three or more objectives.
doc	_EQN_ DFSZ: a technically natural non-supersymmetric model of neutrino masses, baryogenesis, the strong CP problem, and dark matter EOS We describe a minimal extension of the standard model by three right-handed neutrinos, a scalar doublet, and a scalar singlet (the " _EQN_ DFSZ") which serves as an existence proof that weakly coupled high-scale physics can naturally explain phenomenological shortcomings of the SM.	The _EQN_ DFSZ can explain neutrino masses, baryogenesis, the strong CP problem, and dark matter, and remains calculably natural despite a hierarchy of scales up to _EQN_ GeV.
doc	Diffeological Dirac operators and diffeological gluing EOS This manuscript attempts to present a way in which the classical construction of the Dirac operator can be carried over to the setting of diffeology. EOS A more specific aim is to describe a procedure for gluing together two usual Dirac operators and to explain in what sense the result is again a Dirac operator. EOS Since versions of cut-and-paste (surgery) operations have already appeared in the context of Atiyah-Singer theory, we specify that our gluing procedure is designed to lead to spaces that are not smooth manifolds in any ordinary sense, and since much attention has been paid in recent years to Dirac operators on spaces with singularities, we also specify that our approach is more of a piecewise-linear nature (although, hopefully, singular spaces in a more analytic sense will enter the picture sooner or later; EOS but this work is not yet about them).	Most of it is devoted to the diffeological versions of the components that go into the standard definition of a Dirac operator as the composition of a Clifford connection with Clifford action by sections of the cotangent bundle;

doc	Super-Geometrodynamics EOS We present explicit solutions of the time-symmetric initial value constraints, expressed in terms of freely specfiable harmonic functions for examples of supergravity theories, which emerge as effective theories of compactified string theory. EOS These results are a prequisite for the study of the time-evolution of topologically non-trivial initial data for supergravity theories, thus generalising the "Geometrodynamics" program of Einstein-Maxwell theory to that of supergravity theories. EOS Specifically, we focus on examples of multiple electric Maxwell and scalar fields, and analyse the initial data problem for the general Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton theory both with one and two Maxwell fields, and the STU model. EOS The solutions are given in terms of up to eight arbitrary harmonic functions in the STU model.	As a by-product, in order compare our results with known static solutions, the metric in isotropic coordinates and all the sources of the non-extremal black holes are expressed entirely in terms of harmonic functions.
doc	Cosmological particle-based simulations of galaxy formation; numerical loss of angular momentum and disk heating EOS We discuss the role that numerical effects have in cosmological N-Body/SPH simulations of disk galaxy formation.	We show that the resolution of current state-of-the-art calculations, about _EQN_ SPH and dark matter particles within the virial radius of a Milky Way-sized halo at _EQN_, is just enough to avoid artificial losses of angular momentum and dramatic numerical disk heating during the phase of disk assembly.

doc	Potential solar axion signatures in X-ray observations with the XMM-Newton observatory EOS The soft X-ray flux produced by solar axions in the Earth's magnetic field is evaluated in the context of ESA's XMM-Newton observatory. EOS Recent calculations of the scattering of axion-conversion X-rays suggest that the sunward magnetosphere could be an observable source of 0.2-10 keV photons. EOS For XMM-Newton, any conversion X-ray intensity will be seasonally modulated by virtue of the changing visibility of the sunward magnetic field region. EOS A simple model of the geomagnetic field is combined with the ephemeris of XMM-Newton to predict the seasonal variation of the conversion X-ray intensity. EOS This model is compared with stacked XMM-Newton blank sky datasets from which point sources have been systematically removed. EOS Remarkably, a seasonally varying X-ray background signal is observed. EOS The EPIC count rates are in the ratio of their X-ray grasps, indicating a non-instrumental, external photon origin, with significances of 11(pn), 4(MOS1) and 5(MOS2) sigma. EOS After examining the constituent observations spatially, temporally and in terms of the cosmic X-ray background, we conclude that this variable signal is consistent with the conversion of solar axions in the Earth's magnetic field. EOS The spectrum is consistent with a solar axion spectrum dominated by bremsstrahlung- and Compton-like processes, i.e. EOS axion-electron coupling dominates over axion-photon coupling and the peak of the axion spectrum is below 1 keV. EOS A value of 2.2e-22 /GeV is derived for the product of the axion-photon and axion-electron coupling constants, for an axion mass in the micro-eV range.	Comparisons with limits derived from white dwarf cooling may not be applicable, as these refer to axions in the 0.01 eV range.
doc	Multi-Agent Path Finding with Deadlines EOS We formalize Multi-Agent Path Finding with Deadlines (MAPF-DL). EOS The objective is to maximize the number of agents that can reach their given goal vertices from their given start vertices within the deadline, without colliding with each other. EOS We first show that MAPF-DL is NP-hard to solve optimally.	We then present two classes of optimal algorithms, one based on a reduction of MAPF-DL to a flow problem and a subsequent compact integer linear programming formulation of the resulting reduced abstracted multi-commodity flow network and the other one based on novel combinatorial search algorithms.

EOS It includes the mean transformation which is defined by S. EOS H. EOS Lee, W. EOS Y. EOS Lee and Yoon. EOS Next we shall give some properties of it.	Especially, we shall show that the _EQN_ -th iteration of mean transformation of an invertible matrix converges to a normal matrix.
doc	D4-branes on Complete Intersection in Toric Variety EOS We consider D4-branes on toric Calabi-Yau spaces. EOS The quiver gauge theory that describes several D4-branes on the Calabi-Yau has a Higgs branch, that describes configurations of a single large D4-brane with the same charges. EOS We propose that the world volume of such a D4-brane is described by a determinantal variety.	We discuss a description of the Higgs branch of the moduli space in terms of a quiver with twice as many nodes and only bifundamental fields, arising from a _EQN_ system.
doc	Generation of high-order harmonics with tunable photon energy and spectral width using double pulses EOS This work theoretically investigates high-order harmonic generation in rare gas atoms driven by two temporally delayed ultrashort laser pulses. EOS Apart from their temporal delay, the two pulses are identical. EOS Using a single-atom model of the laser-matter interaction it is shown that the photon energy of the generated harmonics is controllable within the range of one eV -- a bandwidth comparable to the photon energy of the fundamental field -- by varying the time delay between the generating laser pulses.	It is also demonstrated that high-order harmonics generated by double pulses have advantageous characteristics, which mimick certain properties of an extreme ultraviolet (XUV) monochromator.
doc	Neutrino effects in two-body electron-capture measurements at GSI EOS Oscillatory behavior of electron capture rates in the two-body decay of hydrogen-like ions into recoil ions plus undetected neutrinos, with a period of approximately 7 s, was reported in storage ring single-ion experiments at the GSI Laboratory, Darmstadt. EOS Ivanov and Kienle [PRL 103, 062502 (2009)] have relegated this period to neutrino masses through neutrino mixing in the final state.	New arguments are given here against this interpretation, while suggesting that these `GSI Oscillations' may be related to neutrino spin precession in the static magnetic field of the storage ring.
doc	General tree-level amplitudes by factorization limits EOS To find boundary contributions is a rather difficult problem when applying the BCFW recursion relation. EOS In this paper, we propose an approach to bypass this problem by calculating general tree amplitudes that contain no polynomial using factorization limits. EOS More explicitly, we construct an expression iteratively, which produces correct factorization limits for all physical poles, and does not contain other poles, then it should be the correct amplitude. EOS To some extent, this approach can be considered as an alternative way to find boundary contributions.	To demonstrate our approach, we present several examples: _EQN_ theory, pure gauge theory, Einstein-Maxwell theory, and Yukawa theory.

If mu is an F-invariant measure which is multiply shift-mixing in a certain way, then we show that mu must be the Haar measure on a coset of some submodule shift of A^M.
doc	Radon measures and Lipschitz graphs EOS For all _EQN_, we investigate the interaction of locally finite measures in _EQN_ with the family of _EQN_ -dimensional Lipschitz graphs. EOS For instance, we characterize Radon measures _EQN_, which are carried by Lipschitz graphs in the sense that there exist graphs _EQN_ such that _EQN_, using only countably many evaluations of the measure. EOS This problem in geometric measure theory was classically studied within smaller classes of measures, e.g.~for the restrictions of _EQN_ -dimensional Hausdorff measure _EQN_ to _EQN_ with _EQN_. EOS However, an example of Cs\" o rnyei, K\" a enm\" a ki, Rajala, and Suomala shows that classical methods are insufficient to detect when a general measure charges a Lipschitz graph.	To develop a characterization of Lipschitz graph rectifiability for arbitrary Radon measures, we look at the behavior of coarse doubling ratios of the measure on dyadic cubes that intersect conical annuli.
doc	An Efficient Likelihood-Based Modulation Classification Algorithm for MIMO Systems EOS Blind algorithms for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signals interception have recently received considerable attention because of their important applications in modern civil and military communication fields. EOS One key step in the interception process is to blindly recognize the modulation type of the MIMO signals. EOS This can be performed by employing a Modulation Classification (MC) algorithm, which can be feature-based or likelihood-based. EOS To overcome the problems associated with the existing likelihood-based MC algorithms, a new algorithm is developed in this paper.	We formulated the MC problem as maximizing a global likelihood function formed by combining the likelihood functions for the estimated transmitted signals, where Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) filtering is employed to separate the MIMO channel into several sub-channels.
doc	Target Space Supersymmetric Sigma Model Calculations EOS We briefly review the covariant formulation of the Green-Schwarz superstring by Berkovits, and describe how a detailed tree-level and one-loop analysis of this model leads, for the first time, to a derivation of the low-energy effective action of the heterotic superstring while keeping target-space supersymmetry manifest.	The resulting low-energy theory is old-minimal supergravity coupled to tensor multiplet.
doc	Alpha-spectroscopy of Cf-252 decays: A new approach to searching for the octoneutron EOS Recently an experimental evidence of emission of neutron clusters consisting of eight neutrons - octoneutrons was reported. EOS The experiment was based on the search for daughter nuclei associated with the octoneutron radioactivity of the Cf-252 nucleus.	The effect of long-time build-up of daughter nuclei with a long half-life and gamma spectroscopy was utilized.
doc	Algebraic classification of Robinson-Trautman spacetimes EOS We consider a general class of four-dimensional geometries admitting a null vector field that has no twist and no shear but has an arbitrary expansion. EOS We explicitly present the Petrov classification of such Robinson-Trautman (and Kundt) gravitational fields, based on the algebraic properties of the Weyl tensor. EOS In particular, we determine all algebraically special subcases when the optically privileged null vector field is a multiple principal null direction (PND), as well as all the cases when it remains a single PND. EOS No field equations are a priori applied, so that our classification scheme can be used in any metric theory of gravity in four dimensions.	In the classic Einstein theory this reproduces previous results for vacuum spacetimes, possibly with a cosmological constant, pure radiation and electromagnetic field, but can be applied to an arbitrary matter content.

doc	One-body reduced density matrix of trapped impenetrable anyons in one dimension EOS We study the one-body reduced density matrix of a system of _EQN_ one-dimensional impenetrable anyons trapped by a harmonic potential. EOS To this purpose we extend two methods developed to tackle related problems, namely the determinant approach and the replica method.	While the former is the basis for exact numerical computations at finite _EQN_, the latter has the advantage of providing an analytic asymptotic expansion for large _EQN_.
doc	Entropy Rates of the Multidimensional Moran Processes and Generalizations EOS The interrelationships of the fundamental biological processes natural selection, mutation, and stochastic drift are quantified by the entropy rate of Moran processes with mutation, measuring the long-run variation of a Markov process. EOS The entropy rate is shown to behave intuitively with respect to evolutionary parameters such as monotonicity with respect to mutation probability (for the neutral landscape), relative fitness, and strength of selection.	Strict upper bounds, depending only on the number of replicating types, for the entropy rate are given and the neutral fitness landscape attains the maximum in the large population limit.
doc	Improved Methods for Hypergraphs EOS We introduce a new background field method for N=2 superspace.	(We treat projective hyperspace, but similar remarks apply for the harmonic case.) In analogy to N=1, background gauge fields are in the real representation, so the lowest-dimension potentials are spinor and the usual non-renormalization theorems are manifest.
doc	Inverse-square law violation and reactor antineutrino anomaly	We discuss a possibility that the so-called reactor antineutrino anomaly can be, at least in part, explained by applying a quantum field-theoretical approach to neutrino oscillations, which in particular predicts a small deviation from the classical inverse-square law at short but macroscopic distances between the neutrino source and detector.
doc	On supergravity in (10,2) EOS We consider the problem of creating locally supersymmetric theories in signature (10,2). EOS The most natural algebraic starting point is the F-algebra, which is the de Sitter-type (10,2) extension of the super-Poincare algebra. EOS We derive the corresponding geometric group curvatures and evaluate the transformations of the associated gauge fields under the action of an infinitesimal group element. EOS We then discuss the formation of locally supersymmetric actions using these quantities. EOS Due to the absence of any vielbein terms there is no obvious way to define spacetime as such. EOS In addition, there is also no way in which we may naturally construct an action which is linear in the twelve dimensional curvatures. EOS We consider the implications of the simplest possible quadratic theories. EOS We then investigate the relationship between the twelve dimensional theories and Lorentz signature theories in lower dimensions. EOS We argue that in this context the process of dimensional reduction must be replaced by that of group theoretic contraction.	Upon contraction a regular spacetime emerges and we find that the twelve dimensional curvature constraint reduces to an Einstein-type equation in which a quadratic non-linearity in the Ricci scalar is suppressed by a factor of the same magnitude as the cosmological constant.
doc	Ultraviolet photonic crystal laser EOS We fabricated two dimensional photonic crystal structures in zinc oxide films with focused ion beam etching. EOS Lasing is realized in the near ultraviolet frequency at room temperature under optical pumping.	From the measurement of lasing frequency and spatial profile of the lasing modes, as well as the photonic band structure calculation, we conclude that lasing occurs in the strongly localized defect modes near the edges of photonic band gap.

EOS These techniques are often based on domain knowledge, static code analysis, and non-functional requirements such as maintainability. EOS In this paper, we present our experience with an approach that extends static analysis with dynamic analysis of a legacy software system's runtime behavior, including the live trace visualization to support the decomposition into microservices.	Overall, our approach combines established analysis techniques for microservice decomposition, such as the bounded context pattern of domain-driven design, and enriches the collected information via dynamic software visualization to identify appropriate microservice boundaries.

doc	Long-time asymptotics for evolutionary crystal dislocation models EOS We consider a family of evolution equations that generalize the Peierls-Nabarro model for crystal dislocations. EOS They can be seen as semilinear parabolic reaction-diffusion equations in which the diffusion is regulated by a fractional Laplace operator of order _EQN_ acting in one space dimension and the reaction is determined by a _EQN_ -periodic multi-well potential. EOS We construct solutions of these equations that represent the typical propagation of _EQN_ equally oriented dislocations of size _EQN_.	For large times, the dislocations occur around points that evolve according to a repulsive dynamical system.
doc	Electron generation of leptons and hadrons with reciprocal alpha-quantized lifetimes and masses EOS Hadron elementary particle measurements have long revealed an alpha-dependence in the long-lived threshold-state lifetimes, together with an alpha-related mass structure, where alpha ~ 1/137 is the fine structure constant. EOS A detailed lifetime analysis shows that of the 156 particles with well-determined lifetimes, the 120 shortest lifetimes have a continuum of values, but the 36 longer lifetimes occur in alpha-spaced groups which are sorted into s, c, b quark flavors. EOS Guided by these lifetime results, we deduce an alpha-generated set of universal mass quanta, based on the electron ground state, which apply to both leptons and hadrons.	A low-mass "threshold-state octet" of particles - muon, proton, tau, pion, eta, eta prime, kaon, phi meson - is reproduced to an average mass accuracy of 0.4%, with no adjustable parameters except a small hadronic binding energy.
doc	Ambient Signals based Load Modeling with Combined Gradient-based Optimization and Regression Method EOS Load modeling has been an important issue in modeling a power system. EOS Ambient signals based load modeling approach has recently been proposed to better track the time-varying changes of load models caused by the increasing uncertain factors in power loads. EOS To improve the computation efficiency and the model structure complexity of the previous approaches, a combined gradient-based optimization and regression method is proposed in this paper to identify the load model parameters from ambient signals. EOS An open static load model structure in which various static load models can be applied, together with the induction motor as the dynamic load model, are selected as the composite load model structure for parameter identification. EOS Then, the static load model parameters are identified through regression, after which the induction motor parameters can be obtained through optimization with the regression residuals being the objective function.	After the transformation of the induction motor model, the objective function is quasiconvex in most of the feasible region so that the gradient-based optimization algorithm can be applied.
doc	Study of the underlying event in top quark pair production in pp collisions at 13 TeV EOS Measurements of normalized differential cross sections as functions of the multiplicity and kinematic variables of charged-particle tracks from the underlying event in top quark and antiquark pair production are presented. EOS The measurements are performed in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, and are based on data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2016 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb _EQN_.	Events containing one electron, one muon, and two jets from the hadronization and fragmentation of b quarks are used.
doc	Novel Aspects in p-Brane Theories: Weyl-Invariant Light-Like Branes EOS We consider a novel class of Weyl-conformally invariant p-brane theories which describe intrinsically light-like branes for any odd world-volume dimension, hence the acronym WILL-branes (Weyl-Invariant Light-Like branes). EOS We discuss in some detail the properties of WILL-brane dynamics which significantly differs from ordinary Nambu-Goto brane dynamics. EOS We provide explicit solutions of WILL-membrane (i.e., p=2) equations of motion in arbitrary D=4 spherically symmetric static gravitational backgrounds, as well as in product spaces of interest in Kaluza-Klein context.	In the first case we find that the WILL-membrane materializes the event horizon of the corresponding black hole solutions, thus providing an explicit dynamical realization of the membrane paradigm in black hole physics.
doc	Description of chiral tetrahedral molecules via an Aufbau approach	We propose a predictive building-up of tetrahedral molecules, based on a previously derived chirality index, which characterizes a tetrahedral molecule, with n chiral centers, as achiral, diastereoisomer, or enantiomer as a function of the observed inversions (at most one for each center) under rotation and superimposition to its mirror immage.
doc	Non-Abelian Collective Excitations in Unlinearized Quark-Gluon Plasma Media EOS We study the effect of unlinearized medium on the collective excitations in quark-gluon plasma.	We present two kinds of non-Abelian oscillation solutions which respectively correspond to weakly and strongly nonlinear coupling of field components in color space.
doc	Attractors of the Einstein-Klein Gordon system EOS It is shown that negative Einstein metrics are attractors of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system.	As an essential part of the proof we upgrade a technique that uses the continuity equation complementary to _EQN_ -estimates to control massive matter fields.
doc	Isodiametric sets in the Heisenberg group EOS In the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg group equipped with its Carnot-Caratheodory metric and with a Haar measure, we consider isodiametric sets, i.e. EOS sets maximizing the measure among all sets with a given diameter. EOS In particular, given an isodiametric set, and up to negligible sets, we prove that its boundary is given by the graphs of two locally Lipschitz functions. EOS Moreover, in the restricted class of rotationally invariant sets, we give a quite complete characterization of any compact (rotationally invariant) isodiametric set.	More specifically, its Steiner symmetrization with respect to the Cn-plane is shown to coincide with the Euclidean convex hull of a CC-ball.
doc	Very small-scale clustering of quasars from a complete quasar lens survey EOS We measure the small-scale (comoving separation 10 kpc/h < r_p < 200 kpc/h) two-point correlation function of quasars using a sample of 26 spectroscopically confirmed binary quasars at 0.6<z<2.2 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Lens Search (SQLS). EOS Thanks to careful candidate selections and extensive follow-up observations of the SQLS, which is aimed at constructing a complete quasar lens sample, our sample of binary quasars is also expected to be nearly complete within a specified range of angular separations and redshifts. EOS The measured small-scale correlation function rises steeply toward smaller scales, which is consistent with earlier studies based on incomplete or smaller binary quasar samples. EOS We find that the quasar correlation function can be fitted by a power-law reasonably well over 4 order of magnitudes, with the best-fit slope of xi(r)\propto r^ -1.92. EOS We interpret the measured correlation function within the framework of the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD).	We propose a simple model which assumes a constant fraction of quasars that appear as satellites in dark matter haloes, and find that measured small-scale clustering signals constrain the satellite fraction to f_sat=0.054_ -0.016 ^ +0.017 for a singular isothermal sphere number density profile of satellites.

We prove that the symmetry group of such a graph is the holomorph of the additive cyclic group _EQN_.
doc	A new method for parameter estimation in probabilistic models: Minimum probability flow EOS Fitting probabilistic models to data is often difficult, due to the general intractability of the partition function. EOS We propose a new parameter fitting method, Minimum Probability Flow (MPF), which is applicable to any parametric model.	We demonstrate parameter estimation using MPF in two cases: a continuous state space model, and an Ising spin glass.
doc	Superdiffusivity of the 1D lattice Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation EOS The continuum Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation in one dimension is lattice discretized in such a way that the drift part is divergence free. EOS This allows to determine explicitly the stationary measures.	We map the lattice KPZ equation to a bosonic field theory which has a cubic anti-hermitian nonlinearity.

doc	An atlas of coronal electron density at 5Rs II: A spherical harmonic method for density reconstruction EOS This is the second of a series of three papers that present a methodology with the aim of creating a set of maps of the coronal density over a period of many years. EOS This paper describes a method for reconstructing the coronal electron density based on spherical harmonics. EOS By assuming a radial structure to the corona at the height of interest, line-of-sight integrations can be made individually on each harmonic basis prior to determining coefficients, i.e. EOS the computationally-expensive integrations are calculated only once during initialization. EOS This approach reduces the problem to finding the set of coefficients which best match the observed brightness using a regularized least-squares approach, and is very efficient. EOS The method is demonstrated on synthetic data created from both a simple and an intricate coronal density model. EOS The quality of reconstruction is found to be reasonable in the presence of noise and large gaps in the data.	The method is applied to both LASCO C2 and STEREO COR2 coronagraph observations from 2009/03/20, and the results from both spacecraft compared.
doc	New minimal supersymmetric SO(10) GUT phenomenology and its cosmological implications EOS Supersymmetric GUTs based on SO(10) gauge group are leading contenders to describe particle physics beyond the Standard Model. EOS Among these the "New minimal supersymmetric SO(10) grand unified theory" (NMSGUT) based on Higgs system 10+120+210+126+ _EQN_ has been developing since 1982. EOS It now successfully fits the whole standard Model gauge coupling, symmetry breaking and fermion mass-mixing data as well as the neutrino mass and mixing data in terms of NMSGUT parameters and just 6 soft supersymmetry breaking parameters defined at the GUT scale. EOS In this thesis we study the phenomenology of NMSGUT, its implications for inflationary and Cold Dark matter cosmology and develop Renormalization group(RG) equations for the flow of NMSGUT couplings in the extreme ultraviolet. EOS In the first part we show that superheavy threshold effects can drastically lower the SO(10) yukawa couplings required for realistic unification and this cures the long standing problem of fast proton decay in Susy GUT. EOS Then we propose a novel Supersymmetric Seesaw inflection(SSI) scenario based upon a SU(2)_L x U(1)_R x U(1)_ B-L invariant model, where the inflation mass is controlled by the large conjugate sneutrino mass. EOS We show that it is much less fine-tuned and more stable than Dirac sneutrino based MSSM inflation. EOS NMSGUT can embed SSI, and even provide a large tensor scalar ratio, but obstacles in achieving enough inflation remain.	The NMSGUT Bino LSP is a good dark matter candidate when it can co-annihilate with a nearly degenerate sfermion as in fits with a light smuon.
doc	Contractions of Symplectic Varieties EOS We consider birational projective contractions f:X -> Y from a smooth symplectic variety X over the complex numbers. EOS We first show that exceptional rational curves on X deform in a family of dimension at least 2n-2. EOS Then we show that these contractions are generically coisotropic, provided X is projective. EOS Then we specialize to contractions with 1-dimensional exceptional fibres. EOS We classify them in a natural way in terms of (\Gamma, G), where \Gamma is a Dynkin diagram of type A_l, D_l or E_l and G is a permutation group of automorphisms of \Gamma. EOS The 1-dimensional fibres do not degenerate, except if the contraction is of type (A_ 2l,S_2). EOS In that case they do not degenerate in codimension 1.	Furthermore we show that the normalization of any irreducible component of Sing(Y) is a symplectic variety.
doc	Black holes and running couplings: A comparison of two complementary approaches EOS Black holes appear as vacuum solutions of classical general relativity which depend on Newton's constant and possibly the cosmological constant. EOS At the level of a quantum field theory, these coupling constants typically acquire a scale-dependence.	This proceedings briefly summarizes two complementary ways to incorporate this effect: the renormalization group improvement of the classical black hole solution based on the running couplings obtained within the gravitational Asymptotic Safety program and the exact solution of the improved equations of motion including an arbitrary scale dependence of the gravitational couplings.
doc	The Limits of the Primitive Equations of Dynamics for Warm, Slowly Rotating Small Neptunes and Super Earths EOS We present significant differences in the simulated atmospheric flow for warm, tidally-locked small Neptunes and super Earths (based on a nominal GJ 1214b) when solving the simplified, and commonly used, primitive dynamical equations or the full Navier-Stokes equations. EOS The dominant prograde, superrotating zonal jet is markedly different between the simulations which are performed using practically identical numerical setups, within the same model. EOS The differences arise due to the breakdown of the so-called `shallow-fluid' and traditional approximations, which worsens when rotation rates are slowed, and day-night temperature contrasts are increased. EOS The changes in the zonal advection between simulations solving the full and simplified equations, give rise to significant differences in the atmospheric redistribution of heat, altering the position of the hottest part of the atmosphere and temperature contrast between the day and night sides. EOS The implications for the atmospheric chemistry and, therefore, observations need to be studied with a model including a more detailed treatment of the radiative transfer and chemistry.	Small Neptunes and super Earths are extremely abundant and important, potentially bridging the structural properties (mass, radius, composition) of terrestrial and gas giant planets.
doc	Greybody factors for Spherically Symmetric Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-de Sitter black hole EOS We study the greybody factors of the scalar fields in spherically symmetric Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-de Sitter black holes in higher dimensions. EOS We derive the greybody factors analytically for both minimally and non-minimally coupled scalar fields.	Moreover, we discuss the dependence of the greybody factor on various parameters including the angular momentum number, the non-minimally coupling constant, the spacetime dimension, the cosmological constant and the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient in detail.
doc	Non-Fermi Liquid Behaviors in the Hubbard model on the Honeycomb lattice EOS In this paper we study the low temperature (_EQN_) behaviors of the weakly interacting Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice with a bare chemical potential, which takes values in a small neighborhood of the renormalized chemical potential _EQN_, which is fixed to be _EQN_.	We prove that the two-point Schwinger's function is an analytic function of the coupling constant _EQN_ in the domain _EQN_.
doc	Binary Black Holes: Spin Dynamics and Gravitational Recoil EOS We present a study of spinning black hole binaries focusing on the spin dynamics of the individual black holes as well as on the gravitational recoil acquired by the black hole produced by the merger. EOS We consider two series of initial spin orientations away from the binary orbital plane. EOS In one of the series, the spins are anti-aligned; EOS for the second series, one of the spins points away from the binary along the line separating the black holes. EOS We find a remarkable agreement between the spin dynamics predicted at 2nd post-Newtonian order and those from numerical relativity. EOS For each configuration, we compute the kick of the final black hole.	We use the kick estimates from the series with anti-aligned spins to fit the parameters in the \KKF, and verify that the recoil along the direction of the orbital angular momentum is _EQN_ and on the orbital plane _EQN_, with _EQN_ the angle between the spin directions and the orbital angular momentum.
doc	Statistical mechanical analysis of sparse linear regression as a variable selection problem EOS An algorithmic limit of compressed sensing or related variable-selection problems is analytically evaluated when a design matrix is given by an overcomplete random matrix. EOS The replica method from statistical mechanics is employed to derive the result. EOS The analysis is conducted through evaluation of the entropy, an exponential rate of the number of combinations of variables giving a specific value of fit error to given data which is assumed to be generated from a linear process using the design matrix. EOS This yields the typical achievable limit of the fit error when solving a representative _EQN_ problem and includes the presence of unfavourable phase transitions preventing local search algorithms from reaching the minimum-error configuration. EOS The associated phase diagrams are presented. EOS A noteworthy outcome of the phase diagrams is that there exists a wide parameter region where any phase transition is absent from the high temperature to the lowest temperature at which the minimum-error configuration or the ground state is reached. EOS This implies that certain local search algorithms can find the ground state with moderate computational costs in that region. EOS Another noteworthy result is the presence of the random first-order transition in the strong noise case. EOS The theoretical evaluation of the entropy is confirmed by extensive numerical methods using the exchange Monte Carlo and the multi-histogram methods.	Another numerical test based on a metaheuristic optimisation algorithm called simulated annealing is conducted, which well supports the theoretical predictions on the local search algorithms.
doc	Thermodynamics of low-dimensional trapped Fermi gases EOS The effects of low dimensionality on the thermodynamics of a Fermi gas trapped by isotropic power law potentials are analyzed. EOS Particular attention is given to different characteristic temperatures that emerge, at low dimensionality, in the thermodynamic functions of state and in the thermodynamic susceptibilities (isothermal compressibility and specific heat).	An energy-entropy argument that physically favors the relevance of one of these characteristic temperatures, namely, the non vanishing temperature at which the chemical potential reaches the Fermi energy value, is presented.
doc	The deepest X-ray view of high-redshift galaxies: constraints on low-rate black-hole accretion EOS We exploit the 7 Ms \textit Chandra observations in the \chandra\,Deep Field-South (\mbox CDF-S), the deepest X-ray survey to date, coupled with CANDELS/GOODS-S data, to measure the total X-ray emission arising from 2076 galaxies at _EQN_. EOS This aim is achieved by stacking the \textit Chandra data at the positions of optically selected galaxies, reaching effective exposure times of _EQN_. EOS We detect significant (_EQN_) X-ray emission from massive galaxies at _EQN_. EOS We also report the detection of massive galaxies at _EQN_ at a _EQN_ confidence level (_EQN_), the highest significance ever obtained for X-ray emission from galaxies at such high redshifts. EOS No significant signal is detected from galaxies at even higher redshifts. EOS The stacking results place constraints on the BHAD associated with the known high-redshift galaxy samples, as well as on the SFRD at high redshift, assuming a range of prescriptions for X-ray emission due to X- ray binaries. EOS We find that the X-ray emission from our sample is likely dominated by processes related to star formation. EOS Our results show that low-rate mass accretion onto SMBHs in individually X-ray-undetected galaxies is negligible, compared with the BHAD measured for samples of X-ray detected AGN, for cosmic SMBH mass assembly at high redshift.	We also place, for the first time, constraints on the faint-end of the AGN X-ray luminosity function (_EQN_) at _EQN_, with evidence for fairly flat slopes.
doc	Optical activity of quantum wells EOS We report on the observation of optical activity of quantum wells resulting in the conversion of the light polarization state controlled by the light propagation direction. EOS The polarization conversion is detected in reflection measurements. EOS We show that a pure _EQN_ -polarized light incident on a quantum well is reflected as an elliptically polarized wave. EOS The signal is drastically enhanced in the vicinity of the light-hole exciton resonance.	We show that the polarization conversion is caused by the spin-orbit splitting of the light hole states and the birefringence of the studied structure.
doc	The Kerr black hole and rotating black string by intersecting M-branes EOS We construct the non-BPS black brane representation from the Kerr metric using the U-duality and symmetries in string or M-theory. EOS We give the general rule to get the brane configuration and we apply it especially for Kerr metric. EOS We find the three charged solution in M-theory and after the compactification it becomes rotating black string solution in five dimension.	We also find the four charged solution containing the pp-wave in M-theory, and we can find charged dilaton rotating black hole solution in four dimension after the torus compactification.
doc	Electronic properties of a nanotorus EOS In this paper we study the properties of an electron trapped on a torus surface. EOS We consider the influence of surface curvature on the spectrum and the behaviour of the wave function. EOS In addition, the effects of external electric and magnetic fields were explored.	Two toroid configurations were considered, namely, a torus-like configuration and a ring-like configuration both in agreement with experimental data.
doc	A nonlinear approach to NN interactions using self-interacting meson fields EOS Motivated by the success of models based on chiral symmetry in NN interactions we investigate self-interacting scalar, pseudoscalar and vector meson fields and their impact for NN forces. EOS We parametrize the corresponding nonlinear field equations and get analytic wavelike solutions. EOS A probability amplitude for the propagation of particle states is calculated and applied in the framework of a boson-exchange NN potential. EOS Using a proper normalization of the meson fields makes all self-scattering amplitudes finite. EOS The same normalization is able to substitute for the phenomenological form factors used in conventional boson exchange potentials and thus yields an phenomenological understanding of this part of the NN interaction.	We find an empirical scaling law which relates the meson self-interaction couplings to the pion mass and self-interaction coupling constant.
doc	Squeezed condensate of gluons and _EQN_ mass difference EOS We consider a mechanism to create the _EQN_ mass difference by the gluon anomaly in a squeezed vacuum. EOS We find that the mass shift of the _EQN_ governing this mass difference is determined by the magnetic part of the gluon condensate.	For the squeezed vacuum this magnetic part coincides with the total gluon condensate, so that we get a relation between the gluon condensate and the mass shift of the _EQN_ as a function of the strong coupling constant _EQN_.
doc	Manifest Verification of QCD Gauge Theory	We analyze the magnetic moment of gluon, find if QCD is nongauge SU(3) theory then the magnetic moment of gluon varnishes, but if QCD is gauge theory then the magnetic moment of gluon will not vanishes.
doc	Codes from unit groups of division algebras over number fields EOS Lenstra and Guruswami described number field analogues of the algebraic geometry codes of Goppa. EOS Recently, the first author and Oggier generalised these constructions to other arithmetic groups: unit groups in number fields and orders in division algebras;	they suggested to use unit groups in quaternion algebras but could not completely analyse the resulting codes.
doc	Stability of trajectories for N -particles dynamics with singular potential EOS We study the stability in finite times of the trajectories of interacting particles.	Our aim is to show that in average and uniformly in the number of particles, two trajectories whose initial positions in phase space are close, remain close enough at later times.
doc	Majorana modes in time-reversal invariant s-wave topological superconductors EOS We present a time-reversal invariant s-wave superconductor supporting Majorana edge modes. EOS The multi-band character of the model together with spin-orbit coupling are key to realizing such a topological superconductor.	We characterize the topological phase diagram by using a partial Chern number sum, and show that the latter is physically related to the parity of the fermion number of the time-reversal invariant modes.
doc	Optoelectronic and Excitonic Properties of Oligoacenes: Substantial Improvements from Range-Separated Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory EOS The optoelectronic and excitonic properties in a series of linear acenes (naphthalene up to heptacene) are investigated using range-separated methods within time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). EOS In these rather simple systems, it is well-known that TDDFT methods using conventional hybrid functionals surprisingly fail in describing the low-lying La and Lb valence states, resulting in large, growing errors for the La state and an incorrect energetic ordering as a function of molecular size. EOS In this work, we demonstrate that the range-separated formalism largely eliminates both of these errors and also provides a consistent description of excitonic properties in these systems. EOS We further demonstrate that re-optimizing the percentage of Hartree-Fock exchange in conventional hybrids to match wavefunction-based benchmark calculations still yields serious errors, and a full 100% Hartree-Fock range separation is essential for simultaneously describing both of the La and Lb transitions.	Based on an analysis of electron-hole transition density matrices, we finally show that conventional hybrid functionals overdelocalize excitons and underestimate quasiparticle energy gaps in the acene systems.

doc	On the Physical Interpretation of the Dirac Wavefunction II: The Massive Dirac Field EOS Using the language of the Geometric Algebra, we recast the massive Dirac bispinor as a set of Lorentz scalar, vector, bivector, pseudovector, and pseudoscalar fields that obey a generalized form of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism.	This field-based formulation requires careful distinction between geometric and non-geometric implementations of the imaginary unit scalar in the Dirac algebra.
doc	Synthesis, Optical, and Magnetic Properties of Ba _EQN_ Ni _EQN_ F _EQN_ Nanowires EOS A low temperature hydrothermal route has been developed, and pure phase Ba _EQN_ Ni _EQN_ F _EQN_ nanowires have been successfully prepared under the optimized conditions. EOS Under the 325 nm excitation, the Ba _EQN_ Ni _EQN_ F _EQN_ nanowires exhibit three emission bands with peak positions locating at 360 nm, 530 nm, and 700 nm, respectively. EOS Combined with the first-principles calculations, the photoluminescence property can be explained by the electron transitions between the t2g and eg orbitals.	Clear hysteresis loops observed below the temperature of 60 K demonstrates the weak ferromagnetism in Ba _EQN_ Ni _EQN_ F _EQN_ nanowires, which has been attributed to the surface strain of nanowires.
doc	Immersions and translation structures I: The space of structures on the pointed disk EOS We define a moduli space of translation structures on the open topological disk with a basepoint and endow it with a locally-compact metrizable topology. EOS We call this the immersive topology, because it is defined using the concept of immersions: continuous maps between subsets of translation surfaces that respect the basepoints and the translation structures.	Immersions induce a partial ordering on the moduli space, and we prove the ordering is nearly a complete lattice in the sense of order theory: The space is only missing a minimal element.
doc	The Holographic Goldstino EOS We find the fingerprints of the Goldstino associated to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in a prototype holographic model for a strongly coupled field theory. EOS The Goldstino massless pole arises in two-point correlators of the supercurrent, due to contact terms in supersymmetry Ward identities.	We show how these contact terms are obtained from the holographic renormalization of the gravitino sector, independently of the details of the bulk background solution.
doc	Dark Matter and Leptogenesis in the Inverse Seesaw EOS We study a seesaw-type extension of the Standard Model in which the symmetry group is enlarged by a global U(1).	We introduce adequate scalar and fermion representations which naturally explain the smallness of neutrino masses.
doc	Anthropic Argument for Three Generations EOS The standard model of particle physics contains N_gen=3 generations of quarks and leptons, i.e., two sets of three particles in each sector, with the two sets differing by 1 unit of charge in each. EOS All 12 "predicted" particles are now experimentally accounted for, and there are strong (though not air-tight) arguments that there are no more than three generations. EOS The question is: why exactly N_gen=3? EOS I argue that three generations is a natural prediction of the multiverse theory, provided one adds the additional, quite reasonable assumption that N_gen in a randomly realized universe is a steeply falling function of number.	In this case N_gen > 2 to permit CP violation (and so baryogenesis and thus physicists) and N_gen < 4 to avoid highly improbable outcomes.
doc	The Quantum Canonical Ensemble EOS The phase space of quantum mechanics can be viewed as the complex projective space endowed with a Kaehlerian structure given by the Fubini-Study metric and an associated symplectic form. EOS We can then interpret the Schrodinger equation as generating a Hamiltonian dynamics. EOS Based upon the geometric structure of the quantum phase space we introduce the corresponding natural microcanonical and canonical ensembles.	The resulting density matrix for the canonical ensemble differs from density matrix of the conventional approach.

doc	Universal, finite temperature, crossover functions of the quantum transition in the Ising chain in a transverse field EOS We consider finite temperature properties of the Ising chain in a transverse field in the vicinity of its zero temperature, second order quantum phase transition. EOS New universal crossover functions for static and dynamic correlators of the ``spin'' operator are obtained.	The static results follow from an early lattice computation of McCoy, and a method of analytic continuation in the space of coupling constants.
doc	Search for supersymmetry in events with a _EQN_ lepton pair and missing transverse momentum in proton-proton collisions at _EQN_ 13 TeV EOS A search for the electroweak production of supersymmetric particles in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is presented in final states with a _EQN_ lepton pair. EOS Both hadronic and leptonic decay modes are considered for the _EQN_ leptons. EOS Scenarios involving the direct pair production of _EQN_ sleptons, or their indirect production via the decays of charginos and neutralinos, are investigated. EOS The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb _EQN_ collected with the CMS detector in 2016. EOS The observed number of events is consistent with the standard model background expectation. EOS The results are interpreted as upper limits on the cross section for _EQN_ slepton pair production in different scenarios.	The strongest limits are observed in the scenario of a purely left-handed low mass _EQN_ slepton decaying to a nearly massless neutralino.
doc	Quantum Transport in Graphene Nanoribbons with Realistic Edges EOS Due to their unique electrical properties, graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) show great promise as the building blocks of novel electronic devices. EOS However, these properties are strongly dependent on the geometry of the edges of the graphene devices. EOS Thus far only zigzag and armchair edges have been extensively studied. EOS However, several other self passivating edge reconstructions are possible, and were experimentally observed. EOS Here we utilize the Nonequilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) technique in conjunction with tight binding methods to model quantum transport through armchair, zigzag, and several other self-passivated edge reconstructions. EOS In addition we consider the experimentally relevant cases of mixed edges, where random combinations of possible terminations exist on a given GNR boundary. EOS We find that transport through GNR's with self-passivating edge reconstructions is governed by the sublattice structure of the edges, in a manner similar to their parent zigzag or armchair configurations.	Furthermore, we find that the reconstructed armchair GNR's have a larger band gap energy than pristine armchair edges and are more robust against edge disorder.
doc	Detecting the work statistics through Ramsey-like interferometry EOS Out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics is attracting considerable interest due to the recent advances in the control and manipulations of systems at the quantum level. EOS Recently, an interferometric scheme for the detection of the characteristic function of the work distribution following a time-dependent process has been proposed [L. EOS Mazzola et al, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS 110 230602 (2013)]. EOS There, it was demonstrated that the work statistics of a quantum system undergoing a process can be reconstructed by effectively mapping the characteristic function of work on the state of an ancillary qubit. EOS Here, we expand that work in two important directions.	We first apply the protocol to an interesting specific physical example consisting of a superconducting qubit dispersively coupled to the field of a microwave resonator, thus enlarging the class of situations for which our scheme would be key in the task highlighted above.
doc	Rough sets and matroidal contraction EOS Rough sets are efficient for data pre-processing in data mining. EOS As a generalization of the linear independence in vector spaces, matroids provide well-established platforms for greedy algorithms. EOS In this paper, we apply rough sets to matroids and study the contraction of the dual of the corresponding matroid. EOS First, for an equivalence relation on a universe, a matroidal structure of the rough set is established through the lower approximation operator.	Second, the dual of the matroid and its properties such as independent sets, bases and rank function are investigated.
doc	Hedging under multiple risk constraints EOS Motivated by the asset-liability management of a nuclear power plant operator, we consider the problem of finding the least expensive portfolio, which outperforms a given set of stochastic benchmarks.	For a specified loss function, the expected shortfall with respect to each of the benchmarks weighted by this loss function must remain bounded by a given threshold.
doc	Fractional ridge regression: a fast, interpretable reparameterization of ridge regression EOS Ridge regression (RR) is a regularization technique that penalizes the L2-norm of the coefficients in linear regression. EOS One of the challenges of using RR is the need to set a hyperparameter (_EQN_) that controls the amount of regularization. EOS Cross-validation is typically used to select the best _EQN_ from a set of candidates. EOS However, efficient and appropriate selection of _EQN_ can be challenging, particularly where large amounts of data are analyzed. EOS Because the selected _EQN_ depends on the scale of the data and predictors, it is not straightforwardly interpretable. EOS Here, we propose to reparameterize RR in terms of the ratio _EQN_ between the L2-norms of the regularized and unregularized coefficients. EOS This approach, called fractional RR (FRR), has several benefits: the solutions obtained for different _EQN_ are guaranteed to vary, guarding against wasted calculations, and automatically span the relevant range of regularization, avoiding the need for arduous manual exploration.	We provide an algorithm to solve FRR, as well as open-source software implementations in Python and MATLAB (https://github.com/nrdg/fracridge).
doc	Edge dislocation core structures in FCC metals determined from ab initio calculations combined with the improved Peierls-Nabarro equation EOS We have employed the improved Peierls-Nabarro (P-N) equation to study the properties of 1/2<110> edge dislocation in 111 plane in FCC metals Al, Cu, Ir, Pd, and Pt. EOS The generalized-stacking-fault energy (GSFE) surface entering the equation is calculated by using first-principles density functional theory (DFT). EOS The accuracy of the method has been tested by calculating values for various stacking fault energies which favorably compare with the previous theoretical and experimental results. EOS The core structures, including the core widths both of the edge and screw components, dissociation behavior for edge dislocations have been investigated.	The dissociated distance between two partials for Al in our calculation agrees well with the values obtained from the numeric simulation with DFT and molecular dynamics simulation, as well as experiment.
doc	Residues of _EQN_ -type and _EQN_ -type Baryons in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation Approach EOS We study the residues of _EQN_ -type baryons (_EQN_ and _EQN_) _EQN_ and _EQN_ -type baryons (_EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_) in the quark-diquark model within the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) formalism. EOS These residues can be used, for example, in the calculations of the amplitudes in the scattering processes. EOS After constructing the baryonic currents in the BS formalism, we derive the relations between the BS wave functions and the residues for these baryons.	The BS equations are solved numerically with the kernel including the scalar confinement and the one gluon exchange terms and with the covariant instantaneous approximation being employed in the calculations.

doc	A binary-response regression model based on support vector machines EOS The soft-margin support vector machine (SVM) is a ubiquitous tool for prediction of binary-response data. EOS However, the SVM is characterized entirely via a numerical optimization problem, rather than a probability model, and thus does not directly generate probabilistic inferential statements as outputs. EOS We consider a probabilistic regression model for binary-response data that is based on the optimization problem that characterizes the SVM.	Under weak regularity assumptions, we prove that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of our model exists, and that it is consistent and asymptotically normal.
doc	The Distance and Metallicity of the Newly Discovered, Nearby Irregular Galaxy HIZSS3 EOS HIZSS3 is an H I source in the Zone of Avoidance. EOS Its radio characteristics are consistent with it being nearby (~ 1.8 Mpc) low-mass dwarf irregular (dIm) galaxy. EOS It contains a modest H II region, but its stellar population has not been resolved by optical observations. EOS MMT spectra of the H II region are used to derive the line-of-sight extinction (E(B-V) = 1.41 +/- 0.04) and gas metallicity (log O/H + 12 ~ 7.8). EOS ESO VLT near-IR images clearly reveal a resolved stellar population. EOS Narrow-band Pbeta images of the H II region are used in combination with previously published Halpha data to obtain an independent line-of-sight extinction estimate: E(B-V) = 1.32 +/- 0.04. EOS The adopted foreground extinction is E(B-V) = 1.36 +/- 0.06. EOS Based on the K-band luminosity function and K,J-K color-magnitude diagram, the apparent magnitude and color of the tip of the red-giant branch (TRGB) are derived.	In turn, these parameters are combined with the adopted foreground extinction to estimate the distance (1.69 +/- 0.07 Mpc) and mean red giant branch metallicity ([Fe/H] = -0.5 +/- 0.1).
doc	A phonon laser utilizing quantum-dot spin states EOS We propose a nano-scale realization of a phonon laser utilizing phonon-assisted spin flips in quantum dots to amplify sound. EOS Owing to a long spin relaxation time, the device can be operated in a strong pumping regime, in which the population inversion is close to its maximal value allowed under Fermi statistics. EOS In this regime, the threshold for stimulated emission is unaffected by spontaneous spin flips.	Considering a nanowire with quantum dots defined along its length, we show that a further improvement arises from confining the phonons to one dimension, and thus reducing the number of phonon modes available for spontaneous emission.
doc	Task-space Synergies for Reaching using Upper-limb Prostheses EOS Synergistic prostheses enable the coordinated movement of the human-prosthetic arm, as required by activities of daily living. EOS This is achieved by coupling the motion of the prosthesis to the human command, such as residual limb movement in motion-based interfaces. EOS Previous studies demonstrated that developing human-prosthetic synergies in joint-space must consider individual motor behaviour and the intended task to be performed, requiring personalisation and task calibration. EOS In this work, an alternative synergy-based strategy, utilising a synergistic relationship expressed in task-space, is proposed. EOS This task-space synergy has the potential to replace the need for personalisation and task calibration with a model-based approach requiring knowledge of the individual user's arm kinematics, the anticipated hand motion during the task and voluntary information from the prosthetic user. EOS The proposed method is compared with surface electromyography-based and joint-space synergy-based prosthetic interfaces in a study of motor behaviour and task performance on able-bodied subjects using a VR-based transhumeral prosthesis.	Experimental results showed that for a set of forward reaching tasks the proposed task-space synergy achieves comparable performance to joint-space synergies and superior to conventional surface electromyography.
doc	The Critical Properties of a Modulated Quantum Sine-Gordon Model EOS A new procedure of trial variational wave functional is proposed for investigating the mass renormailzation and the local structure of the ground state of a one-dimensional quantum sine-Gordon model with linear spatial modulation, whose ground state differs from that without modulation.	The phase diagram obtained in parameters _EQN_ plane shows that the vertical part of the boundary between soliton lattice phase and incommensurate (IC) phase with vanishing gap sticks at _EQN_ _EQN_, the IC phase can only appear for _EQN_ _EQN_ and the IC phase regime is enlarged with increasing spatial modulation in the case of definite parameter _EQN_.
doc	Extremal metrics for the _EQN_ -curvature in three dimensions EOS We construct contact forms with constant _EQN_ -curvature on compact three-dimensional CR manifolds which admit a pseudo-Einstein contact form and satisfy some natural positivity conditions.	These contact forms are obtained by minimizing the CR analogue of the _EQN_ -functional from conformal geometry.
doc	Parameterized Complexity of Discrete Morse Theory EOS Optimal Morse matchings reveal essential structures of cell complexes which lead to powerful tools to study discrete geometrical objects, in particular discrete 3-manifolds. EOS However, such matchings are known to be NP-hard to compute on 3-manifolds, through a reduction to the erasability problem. EOS Here, we refine the study of the complexity of problems related to discrete Morse theory in terms of parameterized complexity. EOS On the one hand we prove that the erasability problem is W[P]-complete on the natural parameter. EOS On the other hand we propose an algorithm for computing optimal Morse matchings on triangulations of 3-manifolds which is fixed-parameter tractable in the treewidth of the bipartite graph representing the adjacency of the 1- and 2-simplexes. EOS This algorithm also shows fixed parameter tractability for problems such as erasability and maximum alternating cycle-free matching.	We further show that these results are also true when the treewidth of the dual graph of the triangulated 3-manifold is bounded.
doc	Topological completeness of logics above S4 EOS It is a celebrated result of McKinsey and Tarski  that S4 is the logic of the closure algebra X+ over any dense-in-itself separable metrizable space. EOS In particular, S4 is the logic of the closure algebra over the reals R, the rationals Q, or the Cantor space C. EOS By, each logic above S4 that has the finite model property is the logic of a subalgebra of Q+, as well as the logic of a subalgebra of C+. EOS This is no longer true for R, and the main result of  states that each connected logic above S4 with the finite model property is the logic of a subalgebra of the closure algebra R+. EOS In this paper we extend these results to all logics above S4. EOS Namely, for a normal modal logic L, we prove that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) L is above S4, (ii) L is the logic of a subalgebra of Q+, (iii) L is the logic of a subalgebra of C+.	We introduce the concept of a well-connected logic above S4 and prove that the following conditions are equivalent: (i) L is a well-connected logic, (ii) L is the logic of a subalgebra of the closure algebra T_2^+ over the infinite binary tree, (iii) L is the logic of a subalgebra of the closure algebra L_2^+ over the infinite binary tree with limits equipped with the Scott topology.

doc	A New Class of Time Dependent Latent Factor Models with Applications EOS In many applications, observed data are influenced by some combination of latent causes. EOS For example, suppose sensors are placed inside a building to record responses such as temperature, humidity, power consumption and noise levels. EOS These random, observed responses are typically affected by many unobserved, latent factors (or features) within the building such as the number of individuals, the turning on and off of electrical devices, power surges, etc. EOS These latent factors are usually present for a contiguous period of time before disappearing; EOS further, multiple factors could be present at a time. EOS This paper develops new probabilistic methodology and inference methods for random object generation influenced by latent features exhibiting temporal persistence. EOS Every datum is associated with subsets of a potentially infinite number of hidden, persistent features that account for temporal dynamics in an observation.	The ensuing class of dynamic models constructed by adapting the Indian Buffet Process --- a probability measure on the space of random, unbounded binary matrices --- finds use in a variety of applications arising in operations, signal processing, biomedicine, marketing, image analysis, etc.
doc	Design and cryogenic operation of a hybrid quantum-CMOS circuit EOS Silicon-On-Insulator nanowire transistors of very small dimensions exhibit quantum effects like Coulomb blockade or single-dopant transport at low temperature. EOS The same process also yields excellent field-effect transistors (FETs) for larger dimensions, allowing to design integrated circuits.	Using the same process, we have co-integrated a FET-based ring oscillator circuit operating at cryogenic temperature which generates a radio-frequency (RF) signal on the gate of a nanoscale device showing Coulomb oscillations.
doc	On the Asymptotic Behaviour of F_2(x,Q^2) EOS We discuss how the proton structure function F2 is described in the HERA kinematic range by double asymptotic expressions for low x and large Q^2.

doc	Soft Physics in STAR EOS The STAR Experiment at RHIC is well-suited to making measurements of particle yields from relativistic nuclear collisions in the low transverse momentum, or "soft", regime.	We present preliminary results on measurements of pion (0,-,+), kaon (-,+,0short), rho, K*0 + anti-K*0, f0, proton, antiproton, phi, Lambda, anti-Lambda, Xi, anti-Xi, Omega, and anti-Omega from the first two years of physics running at RHIC.
doc	Double deeply virtual Compton scattering off the nucleon EOS We study the double deeply virtual Compton scattering (DDVCS) process off the nucleon, through the scattering of a spacelike virtual photon with large virtuality resulting in the production of a timelike virtual photon, decaying into an e^+ e^- pair.	This process is expressed in the Bjorken regime in terms of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and it is shown that by varying the invariant mass of the lepton pair, one can directly extract the GPDs from the observables.
doc	Detuning-controlled internal oscillations in an exciton-polariton condensate EOS We theoretically analyze exciton-photon oscillatory dynamics within a homogenous polariton gas in presence of energy detuning between the cavity and quantum well modes.	Whereas pure Rabi oscillations consist of the particle exchange between the photon and excitons states in the polariton system without any oscillations of the phases of the two sub-condensates, we demonstrate that any non-zero detuning results in oscillations of the relative phase of the photon and exciton macroscopic wave functions.

doc	Lateral superlattices as voltage-controlled traps for excitons EOS We demonstrate the localisation of quantum well excitons in a periodic array of linear traps using photoluminescence experiments. EOS The excitonic traps are induced by applying spatially alternating external voltages via interdigitated metal gates. EOS The localisation originates from the periodical modulation of the strength of the quantum-confined Stark effect in the plane of the quantum well. EOS In our experiments, the trap depth is easily tuned by the voltages applied to the interdigitated gates.	Furthermore, we find that a perpendicular magnetic field reduces the exciton diffusion length.
doc	Searching for gravitational waves from known pulsars at once and twice the spin frequency EOS The existence of a superfluid core in the interior of a rotating neutron star may have an influence on its gravitational wave emission.	In addition to the usually-assumed pure quadrupole radiation with the gravitational wave frequency at twice the spin frequency, a frequency of rotation itself may also be present in the gravitational wave spectrum.
doc	CMC foliations of open spacetimes asymptotic to open Robertson-Walker spacetimes	We consider open globally hyperbolic spacetimes _EQN_ of dimension _EQN_, _EQN_, which are spatially asymptotic to a Robertson-Walker spacetime or an open Friedmann universe with spatial curvature _EQN_ and prove, under reasonable assumptions, that there exists a unique foliation by hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature and that the mean curvature function _EQN_ is a smooth time function if _EQN_ is smooth.
doc	Time-space Finite Element Adaptive AMG for Multi-term Time Fractional Advection Diffusion Equations EOS In this study we construct a time-space finite element (FE) scheme and furnish cost-efficient approximations for one-dimensional multi-term time fractional advection diffusion equations on a bounded domain _EQN_. EOS Firstly, a fully discrete scheme is obtained by the linear FE method in both temporal and spatial directions, and many characterizations on the resulting matrix are established.	Secondly, the condition number estimation is proved, an adaptive algebraic multigrid (AMG) method is further developed to lessen computational cost and analyzed in the classical framework.
doc	Asymptotic variance of random symmetric digital search trees EOS Asymptotics of the variances of many cost measures in random digital search trees are often notoriously messy and involved to obtain. EOS A new approach is proposed to facilitate such an analysis for several shape parameters on random symmetric digital search trees. EOS Our approach starts from a more careful normalization at the level of Poisson generating functions, which then provides an asymptotically equivalent approximation to the variance in question. EOS Several new ingredients are also introduced such as a combined use of the Laplace and Mellin transforms and a simple, mechanical technique for justifying the analytic de-Poissonization procedures involved.	The methodology we develop can be easily adapted to many other problems with an underlying binomial distribution.
doc	Two sites coherence and visibility EOS Wave-particle duality and the superposition of quantum mechanical states furnish quantum mechanics with unique features which distinguishes it from classical mechanics and give it the apparently counter-intuition interpretation. EOS The two principles are responsible for the observation of the interference effects of quantum particles such as electrons, atoms and molecules. EOS Visibility is a measure of the wave nature and can be though of as a "normalized" coherence quantifier. EOS Reduction in the visibility arises from dephasing (decoherence): a process in which the relative phases get partially or totally destroyed leading to domination of the particle nature.	We calculate the coherence and visibility of an ensemble of a single electron and two electrons on two sites using the density matrix formulation.

doc	Carnegie Supernova Project-II: Near-infrared Spectroscopic Diversity of Type II Supernovae EOS We present _EQN_ near-infrared (NIR) spectra of _EQN_ Type II supernovae (SNe II) from the Carnegie Supernova Project-II (CSP-II), the largest such dataset published to date. EOS We identify a number of NIR features and characterize their evolution over time. EOS The NIR spectroscopic properties of SNe II fall into two distinct groups. EOS This classification is first based on the strength of the He I _EQN_ m absorption during the plateau phase; EOS SNe II are either significantly above (spectroscopically strong) or below _EQN_ angstroms (spectroscopically weak) in pseudo equivalent width. EOS However between the two groups, other properties, such as the timing of CO formation and the presence of Sr II, are also observed. EOS Most surprisingly, the distinct weak and strong NIR spectroscopic classes correspond to SNe II with slow and fast declining light curves, respectively. EOS These two photometric groups match the modern nomenclature of SNe IIP and IIL. EOS Including NIR spectra previously published, 18 out of 19 SNe II follow this slow declining-spectroscopically weak and fast declining-spectroscopically strong correspondence. EOS This is in apparent contradiction to the recent findings in the optical that slow and fast decliners show a continuous distribution of properties.	The weak SNe II show a high-velocity component of helium that may be caused by a thermal excitation from a reverse-shock created by the outer ejecta interacting with the red supergiant wind, but the origin of the observed dichotomy is not understood.

doc	Continuity of the von Neumann entropy EOS A general method for proving continuity of the von Neumann entropy on subsets of positive trace-class operators is considered. EOS This makes it possible to re-derive the known conditions for continuity of the entropy in more general forms and to obtain several new conditions. EOS The method is based on a particular approximation of the von Neumann entropy by an increasing sequence of concave continuous unitary invariant functions defined using decompositions into finite rank operators.	The existence of this approximation is a corollary of a general property of the set of quantum states as a convex topological space called the strong stability property.
doc	Scalar potential in F(R) supergravity EOS We derive a scalar potential in the recently proposed N=1 supersymmetric generalization of f(R) gravity in four space-time dimensions. EOS Any such higher-derivative supergravity is classically equivalent to the standard N=1 supergravity coupled to a chiral (matter) superfield, via a Legendre-Weyl transform in superspace. EOS The Kaehler potential, the superpotential and the scalar potential of that theory are all governed by a single holomorphic function.	We also find the conditions for the vanishing cosmological constant and spontaneous supersymmetry breaking, without fine-tuning, which define a no-scale F(R) supergravity.
doc	The Poisson brackets of free null initial data for vacuum general relativity EOS A hypersurface composed of two null sheets, or "light fronts", swept out by the two congruences of future null normal geodesics emerging from a spacelike 2-disk can serve as a Cauchy surface for a region of spacetime. EOS Already in the 1960s free (unconstrained) initial data for vacuum general relativity were found for hypersurfaces of this type. EOS Here the Poisson brackets of such free initial data are calculated from the Hilbert action.	The brackets obtained can form the starting point for a constraint free canonical quantization of general relativity and may be relevant to holographic entropy bounds for vacuum gravity.
doc	Cross-over from BCS superconductivity to Bose condensation and High-Tc Superconductors EOS We consider the Eliashberg theory in the coupling region where some fundamental qualitative deviations from the conventional BCS-like behaviour begin to appear. EOS These deviations are identified as the onset of a cross-over from BCS superconductivity to Bose condensation. EOS We point out that the beginning of this cross-over occurs when the gap _EQN_ becomes comparable to the boson energies _EQN_. EOS This condition is equivalent to the condition of Ref. EOS REF Strinati _EQN_ and traduces the physical constraint that the distance the paired electron covers during the absorbtion of the virtual boson, cannot be larger than the coherence length. EOS The frontier region of couplings is of the order of _EQN_, and high- _EQN_ materials are concerned. EOS A clear qualitative indication of the occurence of a cross-over regime should be a dip structure above the gap in the density of states of excitations. EOS Comparing our results with tunneling and photoemission experiments we conclude that high- _EQN_ materials (cuprates and fullerides) are indeed at the beginning of a cross-over from BCS superconductivity to Bose condensation, even though the fermionic nature still prevails. EOS Taking into account the analysis of Ref.	REF Strinati, we predict a dip structure in heavy fermion and organic superconductors.

doc	Analysis of radial velocity variations in multiple planetary systems EOS The study of multiple extrasolar planetary systems has the opportunity to obtain constraints for the planetary masses and orbital inclinations via the detection of mutual perturbations. EOS The analysis of precise radial velocity measurements might reveal these planet-planet interactions and yields a more accurate view of such planetary systems. EOS Like in the generic data modelling problems, a fit to radial velocity data series has a set of unknown parameters of which parametric derivatives have to be known by both the regression methods and the estimations for the uncertainties. EOS In this paper an algorithm is described that aids the computation of such derivatives in case of when planetary perturbations are not neglected. EOS The application of the algorithm is demonstrated on the planetary systems of HD 73526, HD 128311 and HD 155358. EOS In addition to the functions related to radial velocity analysis, the actual implementation of the algorithm contains functions that computes spatial coordinates, velocities and barycentric coordinates for each planet.	These functions aid the joint analysis of multiple transiting planetary systems, transit timing and/or duration variations or systems where the proper motion of the host star is also measured involving high precision astrometry.
doc	The Algebra of Transition Matrices for the AdS_5 x S^5 Superstring EOS We consider integrability properties of the superstring on _EQN_ background and construct a new one parameter family of currents which satisfies the vanishing curvature condition. EOS We present the Hamiltonian analysis for the sigma model action and determine the Poisson algebra of the transition matrices.	We reveal the generalization of the _EQN_ automorphism analogous to the sigma models defined on a symmetric space coset.
doc	The impact of Lyman- _EQN_ radiative transfer on large-scale clustering in the Illustris simulation EOS Lyman- _EQN_ emitters (LAEs) are a promising probe of the large-scale structure at high redshift, _EQN_. EOS In particular, the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment aims at observing LAEs at 1.9 _EQN_ 3.5 to measure the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale and the Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD). EOS However, Zheng et al (2011) pointed out that the complicated radiative transfer (RT) of the resonant Lyman- _EQN_ emission line generates an anisotropic selection bias in the LAE clustering on large scales, _EQN_ Mpc. EOS This effect could potentially induce a systematic error in the BAO and RSD measurements. EOS Also, Croft et al (2016) claims an observational evidence of the effect in the Lyman- _EQN_ intensity map, albeit statistically insignificant. EOS We aim at quantifying the impact of the Lyman- _EQN_ RT on the large-scale galaxy clustering in detail. EOS For this purpose, we study the correlations between the large-scale environment and the ratio of an apparent Lyman- _EQN_ luminosity to an intrinsic one, which we call the `observed fraction', at _EQN_. EOS We apply our Lyman- _EQN_ RT code by post-processing the full Illustris simulations. EOS We simply assume that the intrinsic luminosity of the Lyman- _EQN_ emission is proportional to the star formation rate of galaxies in Illustris, yielding a sufficiently large sample of LAEs to measure the anisotropic selection bias. EOS We find little correlations between large-scale environment and the observed fraction induced by the RT, and hence a smaller anisotropic selection bias than what was claimed by Zheng et al (2011).	We argue that the anisotropy was overestimated in the previous work due to the insufficient spatial resolution: it is important to keep the resolution such that it resolves the high density region down to the scale of the interstellar medium, _EQN_ physical kpc.
doc	Non parametric Bayesian approach to LR assessment in case of rare haplotype match EOS The evaluation of a match between the DNA profile of a stain found on a crime scene and that of a suspect (previously identified) involves the use of the unknown parameter _EQN_, (the ordered vector which represents the proportions of the different DNA profiles in the population of potential donors) and the names of the different DNA types.	We propose a Bayesian non parametric method which considers _EQN_ as a random variable distributed according to the two-parameter Poisson Dirichlet distribution, and discard information about names of DNA types.
doc	A simple 5D SO(10) GUT and sparticle masses EOS Simple supersymmetric SO(10) GUT in five dimensions is proposed, in which the fifth dimension is compactified on the _EQN_ orbifold with two inequivalent branes at the orbifold fixed points. EOS In this model, all matter and Higgs multiplets reside on one brane (PS brane) where the Pati-Salam (PS) symmetry is manifest, while only the SO(10) gauge multiplet resides on the bulk.	The supersymmetry breaking on the other brane (SO(10) brane) is transmitted to the PS brane through the gaugino mediation with the bulk gauge multiplet.

doc	Tarski's Theorem, Supermodular Games, and the Complexity of Equilibria EOS The use of monotonicity and Tarski's theorem in existence proofs of equilibria is very widespread in economics, while Tarski's theorem is also often used for similar purposes in the context of verification. EOS However, there has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity of finding the fixed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. EOS We study a computational formalism based on monotone functions on the _EQN_ -dimensional grid with sides of length _EQN_, and their fixed points, as well as the closely connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. EOS It is known that finding some (any) fixed point of a monotone function can be done in time _EQN_, and we show it requires at least _EQN_ function evaluations already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for randomized algorithms. EOS We show that the general Tarski problem of finding some fixed point, when the monotone function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class PLS of problems solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class PPAD. EOS Finding the greatest or least fixed point guaranteed by Tarski's theorem, however, requires _EQN_ steps, and is NP-hard in the white box model. EOS For supermodular games, we show that finding an equilibrium in such games is essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and finding the maximum or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. EOS Interestingly, two-player supermodular games where the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional can be solved in _EQN_ steps.	We also observe that computing (approximating) the value of Condon's (Shapley's) stochastic games reduces to the Tarski problem.
doc	Stringent Phenomenological Investigation into Heterotic String Optical Unification EOS For the weakly coupled heterotic string (WCHS) there is a well-known factor of twenty conflict between the minimum string coupling unification scale, Lambda_H ~5x10^(17) GeV, and the projected MSSM unification scale, Lambda_U ~ 2.5x10^(16) GeV, assuming an intermediate scale desert (ISD). EOS Renormalization effects of intermediate scale MSSM-charged exotics (ISME) (endemic to quasi-realistic string models) can resolve this issue, pushing the MSSM scale up to the string scale. EOS However, for a generic string model, this implies that the projected Lambda_U unification under ISD is accidental. EOS If the true unification scale is 5.0x10^(17) GeV, is it possible that illusionary unification at 2.5x10^(17) GeV in the ISD scenario is not accidental? EOS If it is not, then under what conditions would the assumption of ISME in a WCHS model imply apparent unification at Lambda_U when ISD is falsely assumed? EOS Geidt's "optical unification" suggests that Lambda_U is not accidental, by offering a mechanism whereby a generic MSSM scale Lambda_U < Lambda_H is guaranteed. EOS A WCHS model was constructed that offers the possibility of optical unification, depending on the availability of anomaly-cancelling flat directions meeting certain requirements. EOS This paper reports on the systematic investigation of the optical unification properties of the set of stringent flat directions of this model.	Stringent flat directions can be guaranteed to be F-flat to all finite order (or to at least a given finite order consistent with electroweak scale supersymmetry breaking) and can be viewed as the likely roots of more general flat directions.
doc	Triple Higgs boson production to six _EQN_ -jets at a 100 TeV proton collider EOS We investigate the production of three Higgs bosons at a proton-proton collider running at a centre-of-mass energy of 100 TeV, all of which decay into _EQN_ -jets. EOS This final state encapsulates by far the largest fraction of the total cross section of triple Higgs boson production, approximately _EQN_.	We examine, by constructing detailed phenomenological analyses, two scenarios: (i) one in which the triple and quartic Higgs boson self-couplings are modified independently by new phenomena with respect to their Standard Model (SM) values and (ii) an extension of the SM by a gauge-singlet scalar that could drive first-order electroweak phase transition, within the context of the so-called xSM.
doc	Electromagnetic Evidence that SSS17a is the Result of a Binary Neutron Star Merger EOS 11 hours after the detection of gravitational wave source GW170817 by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers, an associated optical transient SSS17a was discovered in the galaxy NGC 4993. EOS While the gravitational wave data indicate GW170817 is consistent with the merger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide independent constraints of the nature of that system. EOS Here we synthesize all optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by the One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration. EOS We find that SSS17a is unlike other known transients.	The source is best described by theoretical models of a kilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture (the r-process).
doc	Refinements of the holonomic approximation lemma EOS The holonomic approximation lemma of Eliashberg and Mishachev is a powerful tool in the philosophy of the _EQN_ principle. EOS By carefully keeping track of the quantitative geometry behind the holonomic approximation process, we establish several refinements of this lemma.	Gromov's idea from convex integration of working one pure partial derivative at a time is central to the discussion.

doc	High Field de Haas - van Alphen Studies of the Fermi Surfaces of LaMIn _EQN_ (M = Co, Rh, Ir) EOS We report measurements of the de Haas - van Alphen effect on a series of compounds, LaMIn _EQN_ (M = Co, Rh, Ir). EOS The results show that each of the Co and Ir Fermi surfaces (FSs) exhibit some portions that are two dimensional and some portions that are three dimensional. EOS The most two dimensional character is exhibited in LaCoIn _EQN_, less two dimensional behavior is seen in LaIrIn _EQN_, no part of Fermi surface of LaRhIn _EQN_ is found to have a two dimensional character. EOS Thus the two dimensionality of portions of the FSs is largely determined by the d character of the energy bands while all of the effective masses remain _EQN_ 1.2.	This fact has implications for the causes of the heavy fermion nature of superconductivity and magnetism in the Ce-based compounds having the similar composition and structure.
doc	Unidirectional light emission from low-index polymer microlasers EOS We report on experiments with deformed polymer microlasers that have a low refractive index and exhibit unidirectional light emission.	We demonstrate that the highly directional emission is due to transport of light rays along the unstable manifold of the chaotic saddle in phase space.
doc	Robust Resource Allocation for Full-Duplex Cognitive Radio Systems EOS In this paper, we investigate resource allocation algorithm design for full-duplex (FD) cognitive radio systems. EOS The secondary network employs a FD base station for serving multiple half-duplex downlink and uplink users simultaneously. EOS We study the resource allocation design for minimizing the maximum interference leakage to primary users while providing quality of service for secondary users. EOS The imperfectness of the channel state information of the primary users is taken into account for robust resource allocation algorithm design.	The algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem and solved optimally by applying semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation.

doc	Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Networks EOS Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) embed nodes in a graph into Euclidean space, which has been shown to incur a large distortion when embedding real-world graphs with scale-free or hierarchical structure. EOS Hyperbolic geometry offers an exciting alternative, as it enables embeddings with much smaller distortion. EOS However, extending GCNs to hyperbolic geometry presents several unique challenges because it is not clear how to define neural network operations, such as feature transformation and aggregation, in hyperbolic space. EOS Furthermore, since input features are often Euclidean, it is unclear how to transform the features into hyperbolic embeddings with the right amount of curvature. EOS Here we propose Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (HGCN), the first inductive hyperbolic GCN that leverages both the expressiveness of GCNs and hyperbolic geometry to learn inductive node representations for hierarchical and scale-free graphs.	We derive GCN operations in the hyperboloid model of hyperbolic space and map Euclidean input features to embeddings in hyperbolic spaces with different trainable curvature at each layer.
doc	Nuts and Bolts of a Realistic Stochastic Geometric Analysis of mmWave HetNets: Hardware Impairments and Channel Aging EOS Motivated by heterogeneous networks (HetNets) design in improving coverage and by millimeter-wave (mmWave) transmission offering an abundance of extra spectrum, we present a general analytical framework shedding light to the downlink of realistic mmWave HetNets consisting of _EQN_ tiers of randomly located base stations (BSs). EOS Specifically, we model, by virtue of stochastic geometry tools, the \textit multi-tier \textit multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) mmWave network degraded by the inevitable \textit residual additive transceiver hardware impairments (RATHIs) and \textit channel aging. EOS Given this setting, we derive the coverage probability and the area spectral efficiency (ASE), and we subsequently evaluate the impact of residual transceiver hardware impairments (RTHIs) and channel aging on these metrics. EOS Different path-loss laws for line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) are accounted for the analysis, which are among the distinguishing features of mmWave systems.	Among the findings, we show that the RATHIs have a meaningful impact at the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, while the transmit additive distortion degrades further than the receive distortion the system performance.

doc	CFA2: a Context-Free Approach to Control-Flow Analysis EOS In a functional language, the dominant control-flow mechanism is function call and return. EOS Most higher-order flow analyses, including k-CFA, do not handle call and return well: they remember only a bounded number of pending calls because they approximate programs with control-flow graphs. EOS Call/return mismatch introduces precision-degrading spurious control-flow paths and increases the analysis time. EOS We describe CFA2, the first flow analysis with precise call/return matching in the presence of higher-order functions and tail calls.	We formulate CFA2 as an abstract interpretation of programs in continuation-passing style and describe a sound and complete summarization algorithm for our abstract semantics.
doc	The faint HI environment of galaxies: a laboratory for testing galaxy formation EOS The SKA is a unique instrument to open a window on many aspects of galaxy formation and evolution which can be examined in our Local Universe.	Here I will focus on the outermost regions of galaxies which can be observed with sufficient sensitivity and resolution at 21-cm as to enlighten the interplay between galaxies and the intergalactic gas, the competing race between the local dark matter gravity and the external ionizing radiation field.
doc	Consistency of the dynamical high-scale type-I seesaw mechanism EOS We analyze the consistency of electroweak breaking within the simplest high-scale Standard Model type-I seesaw mechanism. EOS We derive the full two-loop RGEs of the relevant parameters, including the quartic Higgs self-coupling of the Standard Model.	For the simplest case of bare "right-handed" neutrino mass terms we find that, with large Yukawa couplings, the Higgs quartic self-coupling becomes negative much below the seesaw scale, so that the model may be inconsistent even as an effective theory.
doc	Exact Solution of the Asymmetric Exclusion Model with Particles of Arbitrary Size EOS A generalization of the simple exclusion asymmetric model is introduced. EOS In this model an arbitrary mixture of molecules with distinct sizes _EQN_, in units of lattice space, diffuses asymmetrically on the lattice. EOS A related surface growth model is also presented. EOS Variations of the distribution of molecules's sizes may change the excluded volume almost continuously.	We solve the model exactly through the Bethe ansatz and the dynamical critical exponent _EQN_ is calculated from the finite-size corrections of the mass gap of the related quantum chain.
doc	A Second Intense Burst with Photospheric Radius Expansion from X2127+119 in M15 EOS In 2000 September we observed a bright X-ray burst from X2127+119 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. EOS This burst has a multi-peaked profile, a peak luminosity of ~6.5x10^ 38 erg s^ -1, a total integrated energy of ~2x10^ 40 ergs, and significant photospheric radius expansion to a maximum extent of R=118+-5 km. EOS From the luminosity-temperature relation during the expansion phase we derive estimates for the gravitational redshift at the neutron star surface, the corrected Eddington luminosity, and the neutron star mass. EOS We detect no slow (~30s) radial oscillations or fast (100-1200 Hz) coherent oscillations or QPO during the burst.	The 2000 September event is only the second burst ever observed from this globular cluster binary (in M15 = NGC 7078), and it shares many characteristics with the event detected by Ginga in 1988 October (Dotani et al 1990;
doc	The little-hierarchy problem is a little problem: understanding the difference between the big- and little-hierarchy problems with Bayesian probability EOS Experiments are once again under way at the LHC. EOS This time around, however, the mood in the high-energy physics community is pessimistic. EOS There is a growing suspicion that naturalness arguments that predict new physics near the weak scale are faulty and that prospects for a new discovery are limited. EOS We argue that such doubts originate from a misunderstanding of the foundations of naturalness arguments. EOS In spite of the first run at the LHC, which aggravated the little-hierarchy problem, there is no cause for doubting naturalness or natural theories. EOS Naturalness is grounded in Bayesian probability logic - it is not a scientific theory and it makes no sense to claim that it could be falsified or that it is under pressure from experimental data. EOS We should remain optimistic about discovery prospects;	natural theories, such as supersymmetry, generally predict new physics close to the weak scale.
doc	Deterministic aperiodic composite lattice-structured silicon thin films for photon management EOS Exotic manipulation of the flow of photons in nanoengineered semiconductor materials with an aperiodic distribution of nanostructures plays a key role in efficiency-enhanced and industrially viable broadband photonic technologies. EOS Through a generic deterministic nanotechnological route, in addition to periodic, transversely quasicrystallographic or disordered random photonic lattices, here we show scalable nanostructured semiconductor thin films on large area nanoimprinted substrates up to 4cm^2 with advanced functional features of aperiodic composite nanophotonic lattices having tailorable supercell tiles. EOS The richer Fourier spectra of the presented artificially nanostructured materials with well-defined lattice point morphologies are designed functionally akin to two-dimensional incommensurate intergrowth aperiodic lattices-comprising periodic photonic crystals and in-plane quasicrystals as subgroups.	The composite photonic lattice-structured crystalline silicon thin films with tapered nanoholes or nanocone-nanoholes are presented showing up to +30 % achievable short circuit current density in comparison to a periodic counterpart where as it is up to +190 % in comparison to a reference unstructured silicon thin film of 300 nanometers of thickness.

doc	Doping dependence of bose condensation energy and correlations with spectral peak intensity and superfluid weight in high Tc cuprates EOS Based on our recent holon-pair boson theory of the t-J Hamiltonian (Phys. EOS Rev. EOS B 64, 052501 (2001)) we report the doping dependence of the bose condensation energy, superfluid weight and spectral peak intensity. EOS We find a universality of doping dependence in these physical quantities, by equally showing an arch shape in the variations of their magnitudes with the hole doping concentration.	We find that all of these physical quantities scale well with the positive charge carrier (hole) density x, but not with the electron density 1-x for the entire range of hole doping.
doc	Understanding Customers' Evaluations Through Mining Airline Reviews EOS Data mining can be evaluated as a strategic tool to determine the customer profiles in order to learn customer expectations and requirements. EOS Airline customers have different characteristics and if passenger reviews about their trip experiences are correctly analyzed, companies can increase customer satisfaction by improving provided services. EOS In this study, we investigate customer review data for in-flight services of airline companies and draw customer models with respect to such data. EOS In this sense, we apply two approaches as feature-based and clustering-based modelling. EOS In feature-based modelling, customers are grouped into categories based on features such as cabin flown types, experienced airline companies. EOS In clustering-based modelling, customers are first clustered via k-means clustering and then modeled.	We apply multivariate regression analysis to model customer groups in both cases.
doc	On the value of the non-perturbative field renormalization constant Z in gauge theories EOS In the perturbative approach to quantum field theory it is common to replace the propagator _EQN_ for a scalar field by a similar expression, namely _EQN_, where the shift of the mass from _EQN_ to _EQN_ reflects the mass renormalization and the constant~ _EQN_ is the renormalized field strength (or wave-function). EOS We argue that, contrary to general belief, the non-perturbative value of~ _EQN_ is not necessarily equal to zero in case the two-point function of an interacting quantum field theory is, as expected, more singular on the light-cone than the corresponding free field two-point function. EOS If, however, (massless) photons or composite (unstable) particles are present, the condition _EQN_ follows from two qualitatively different arguments, one being a theorem due to Buchholz, the other a criterion due to Weinberg.	Hence, the condition _EQN_ is, after all, a universal feature of realistic models of elementary particle physics, which include massless or unstable particles.

We show that this duality holds for Super Yang-Mills theories with N=0,1,2,4 supersymmetry.
doc	Realization of the Switching Mechanism in Resistance Random Access Memory (RRAMTM) Devices: Structural and Electronic Properties Affecting Electron Conductivity in Halfnium Oxide-Electrode System through First Principles Calculations EOS Resistance Random Access Memory (RRAMTM) device, with its electrically induced nanoscale resistive switching capacity, has been gaining considerable attention as future non-volatile memory device. EOS Here, we propose a mechanism of switching based on oxygen vacancy migration-driven change in electronic properties of the transition metal oxide (TMO) film stimulated by set pulse voltages. EOS We used density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations to account for the effect of oxygen vacancy and its migration on the electronic properties of HfO2 and Ta/HfO2 systems, and thereby create the entire story on RRAMTM's switching mechanism.	Computational results on the activation energy barrier for oxygen vacancy migration were found to be consistent with the results of set and reset pulse voltage obtained from experiment.
doc	Optimal-order bounds on the rate of convergence to normality for maximum likelihood estimators EOS It is well known that under general regularity conditions the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is asymptotically normal. EOS Very recently, bounds of the optimal order _EQN_ on the closeness of the distribution of the MLE to normality in the so-called bounded Wasserstein distance were obtained, where _EQN_ is the sample size. EOS However, the corresponding bounds on the Kolmogorov distance were only of the order _EQN_. EOS In this note, bounds of the optimal order _EQN_ on the closeness of the distribution of the MLE to normality in the Kolmogorov distance are given, as well as their nonuniform counterparts, which work better for large deviations of the MLE.	These results are based on previously obtained general optimal-order bounds on the rate of convergence to normality in the multivariate delta method.
doc	The information content of gravitational wave harmonics in compact binary inspiral EOS The nonlinear aspect of gravitational wave generation that produces power at harmonics of the orbital frequency, above the fundamental quadrupole frequency, is examined to see what information about the source is contained in these higher harmonics. EOS We use an order (4/2) post-Newtonian expansion of the gravitational wave waveform of a binary system to model the signal seen in a spaceborne gravitational wave detector such as the proposed LISA detector. EOS Covariance studies are then performed to determine the ultimate accuracy to be expected when the parameters of the source are fit to the received signal. EOS We find three areas where the higher harmonics contribute crucial information that breaks degeneracies in the model and allows otherwise badly-correlated parameters to be separated and determined. EOS First, we find that the position of a coalescing massive black hole binary in an ecliptic plane detector, such as OMEGA, is well-determined with the help of these harmonics.	Second, we find that the individual masses of the stars in a chirping neutron star binary can be separated because of the mass dependence of the harmonic contributions to the wave.
doc	Zeeman shift of an electron trapped near a surface EOS Boundary dependent corrections to the spin energy eigenvalues of an electron in a weak magnetic field and confined by a harmonic trapping potential are investigated. EOS The electromagnetic field is quantized through a normal mode expansion obeying the Maxwell boundary conditions at the material surface. EOS We couple the electron to this photon field and a classical magnetic field in the Dirac equation, to which we apply the unitary Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation in order to generate a non-relativistic approximation of the Hamiltonian to the desired order.	We obtain the Schr\"odinger eigenstates of an electron subject to double confinement by a harmonic potential and a classical magnetic field, and then use these within second-order perturbation theory to calculate the spin energy shift that is attributable to the surface-modified quantized field.
doc	The Lattice _EQN_ Parameter in Domain Wall QCD EOS We evaluate the ratio of the scale parameter _EQN_ in domain wall QCD to the one in the continuum theory at one loop level incorporating the effect of massless quarks.

doc	The effect of varying Fe-content on transport properties of K intercalated iron selenide KxFe2-ySe2 EOS We report the successful growth of high-quality single crystals of potassium intercalated iron selenide KxFe2-ySe2 by Bridgeman method. EOS The effect of iron vacancies on transport properties was investigated by electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements. EOS With varying iron content, the system passes from semiconducting/insulating to superconducting state. EOS Comparing with superconductivity, the anomalous "hump" effect in the normal state resistivity is much more sensitive to the iron deficiency. EOS The electrical resistivity exhibits a perfect metallic behavior (R300K/R35K=42) for the sample with little iron vacancies.	Our results suggest that the anomalous "hump" effect in the normal state resistivity may be due to the ordering process of the cation vacancies in this non-stoichiometric compound rather than magnetic/structure transition.
doc	Symmetries of Differential equations and Applications in Relativistic Physics EOS In this thesis, we study the one parameter point transformations which leave invariant the differential equations. EOS In particular we study the Lie and the Noether point symmetries of second order differential equations. EOS We establish a new geometric method which relates the point symmetries of the differential equations with the collineations of the underlying manifold where the motion occurs. EOS This geometric method is applied in order the two and three dimensional Newtonian dynamical systems to be classified in relation to the point symmetries; EOS to generalize the Newtonian Kepler-Ermakov system in Riemannian spaces;	to study the symmetries between classical and quantum systems and to investigate the geometric origin of the Type II hidden symmetries for the homogeneous heat equation and for the Laplace equation in Riemannian spaces.
doc	Malleability of complex networks EOS Most complex networks are not static, but evolve along time. EOS Given a specific configuration of one such changing network, it becomes a particularly interesting issue to quantify the diversity of possible unfoldings of its topology. EOS In this work, we suggest the concept of malleability of a network, which is defined as the exponential of the entropy of the probabilities of each possible unfolding with respect to a given configuration. EOS We calculate the malleability with respect to specific measurements of the involved topologies. EOS More specifically, we identify the possible topologies derivable from a given configuration and calculate some topological measurement of them (e.g. EOS clustering coefficient, shortest path length, assortativity, etc.), leading to respective probabilities being associated to each possible measurement value. EOS Though this approach implies some level of degeneracy in the mapping from topology to measurement space, it still paves the way to inferring the malleability of specific network types with respect to given topological measurements.	We report that the malleability, in general, depends on each specific measurement, with the average shortest path length and degree assortativity typically leading to large malleability values.
doc	Multiphoton signatures of goldstini at the LHC EOS We study models of gauge mediated SUSY breaking with more than one hidden sector. EOS In these models the neutralino sector of the MSSM is supplemented with additional light neutral fermions, the nearly massless gravitino and the massive pseudo-goldstini. EOS For the case where the Bino is the lightest ordinary SUSY particle, its preferred decay is to a photon and the heaviest pseudo-goldstino, which generically cascades down to lighter pseudo-goldstini, or to the gravitino, in association with photons. EOS This gives rise to multiphoton plus missing energy signatures at the LHC. EOS We investigate in detail simplified models where the SUSY spectrum consists of the right-handed sleptons, a Bino-like neutralino, the pseudo-goldstini and the gravitino. EOS We compare against existing LHC searches and show that the sensitivity to our models could be significantly improved by relaxing the kinematic cuts and requiring additional final state particles.	We propose inclusive searches in the final state with at least three photons plus missing energy and in the final state with at least two photons plus two leptons plus missing energy, the former being sensitive to any production mode and the latter being optimized for slepton pair production.
doc	BRST-Symmetry Breaking and Bose-Ghost Propagator in Lattice Minimal Landau Gauge EOS The Bose-ghost propagator has been proposed as a carrier of the confining force in Yang-Mills theories in minimal Landau gauge. EOS We present the first numerical evaluation of this propagator, using lattice simulations for the SU(2) gauge group in the scaling region. EOS Our data are well described by a simple fitting function, which is compatible with an infrared-enhanced Bose-ghost propagator.	This function can also be related to a massive gluon propagator in combination with an infrared-free (Faddeev-Popov) ghost propagator.

doc	Cold-atmospheric plasma induces tumor cell death in preclinical in vivo and in vitro models of human cholangiocarcinoma EOS Through the last decade, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has emerged as an innovative therapeutic option for cancer treatment. EOS Recently, we have set up a potentially safe atmospheric pressure plasma jet device that displays antitumoral properties in a preclinical model of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a rare and very aggressive cancer emerging from the biliary tree with few efficient treatments. EOS In the present study, we aimed at deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of CAP towards CCA both in an in vivo and in vitro context. EOS In vivo, using subcutaneous xenografts into immunocompromised mice, CAP treatment of CCA induced DNA lesions and tumor cell apoptosis, as evaluated by 8-oxoguanine and cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry, respectively. EOS Analysis of the tumor microenvironment showed changes in markers related to macrophage polarization. EOS In vitro, incubation of CCA cells with CAP-treated culture media (i.e. EOS plasma-activated media, PAM) led to a dose response decrease in cell survival.	At molecular level, CAP treatment induced double-strand DNA breaks, followed by an increased phosphorylation and activation of the cell cycle master regulators CHK1 and p53, leading to cell cycle arrest and cell death by apoptosis.
doc	Di-chromatic Interpolation of Magnetic Resonance Metabolic Imagery EOS Magnetic resonance imaging with hyperpolarized contrast agents can provide unprecedented in vivo measurements of metabolism, but yields images that are lower resolution than that achieved when imaging water. EOS To simultaneously display both images to the user, perhaps by fusing the images together, one must first interpolate the metabolic image to be the same size as that of the proton image. EOS Common choices for doing so include nearest-neighbor interpolation and linear interpolation. EOS In this work, we present a method that uses the proton imagery to inform the interpolation values of the metabolic image.	The interpolated image is the result of a convex optimization algorithm which is solved with the Fast Iterative Shrinkage Threshold Algorithm (FISTA).

This relationship is discussed in light of our current understanding of the nature and origin of the interstellar medium (ISM), and in particular in the context of the interplay between the different multi-temperature components.

doc	What Do CFTs Tell Us About Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes? EOS The AdS/CFT conjecture relates quantum gravity on Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space to a conformal field theory (CFT) defined on the spacetime boundary. EOS We interpret the CFT in terms of natural analogues of the bulk S-matrix. EOS Our first approach finds the bulk S-matrix as a limit of scattering from an AdS bubble immersed in a space admitting asymptotic states. EOS Next, we show how the periodicity of geodesics obstructs a standard LSZ prescription for scattering within global AdS. EOS To avoid this subtlety we partition global AdS into patches within which CFT correlators reconstruct transition amplitudes of AdS states.	Finally, we use the AdS/CFT duality to propose a large N collective field theory that describes local, perturbative supergravity.

We make prediction for the evolution of the shape of the condensate and the number of atoms in it for different trap symmetries (cigar to pancake) as well as in the presence of an optical lattice potential.

doc	First-principles study of ternary graphite compounds cointercalated with alkali atoms (Li, Na, and K) and alkylamines towards alkali ion battery applications EOS Using density functional theory calculations, we have investigated the structural, energetic, and electronic properties of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) containing alkali atoms (AM) and normal alkylamine molecules (nC _EQN_), denoted as AM-nC _EQN_ -GICs (AM=Li, Na, K, _EQN_ =1, 2, 3, 4). EOS The orthorhombic unit cells have been used to build the models for crystalline stage-I AM-nC _EQN_ -GICs. EOS By performing the variable cell relaxations and the analysis of results, we have found that with the increase in the atomic number of alkali atoms the layer separations decreases in contrast to AM-GICs, while the bond lengths of alkali atoms with graphene layer and nitrogen atom of alkylamine decreases. EOS The formation and interlayer binding energies of AM-nC3-GICs have been calculated, indicating the increase in stability from Li to K.	The calculated energy barriers for migration of alkali atoms suggest that alkali cation with larger ionic radius diffuses in graphite more smoothly, being similar to AM-GICs.

In addition, a bus waveguide pulley coupler realizes critical coupling to the microrings at both of the cesium D-line frequencies, while high coupling efficiency is achieved at the cesium 'magic' wavelengths for creating a lattice of two-color evanescent field traps above a microring.

EOS All the SMWs are found to be highly stable ferromagnetic half-metals, showing spin switching behavior. EOS Transport calculations show that finite size clusters display spin filter property when coupled with Au electrodes on either side. EOS I-V characteristics of all systems confirm the spin filter property, with Au-BzVCpVBz-Au displaying exceptionally high performance. EOS In addition to spin filtering, the Au-BzFeCpFeBz-Au system also shows negative differential resistance (NDR).	Compression causes an abrupt reduction in magnetic moment and a transition to a metallic phase, while stretching causes an increase in magnetic moment.
doc	Destabilization of fronts in a class of bi-stable systems EOS In this article, we consider a class of bi-stable reaction-diffusion equations in two components on the real line. EOS We assume that the system is singularly perturbed, i.e. EOS that the ratio of the diffusion coefficients is (asymptotically) small. EOS This class admits front solutions that are asymptotically close to the (stable) front solution of the `trivial' scalar bi-stable limit system _EQN_. EOS However, in the system these fronts can become unstable by varying parameters.	This destabilization is either caused by the essential spectrum associated to the linearized stability problem, or by an eigenvalue that exists near the essential spectrum.
doc	Relativistic effects in galaxy clustering in a parametrized post-Friedmann universe EOS We explore the signatures of quintessence and modified gravity theories in the relativistic description of galaxy clustering within a parametrized post-Friedmann framework. EOS For this purpose, we develop a calibration method to consistently account for horizon-scale effects in the linear parametrized Post-Friedmann perturbations of minimally and nonminimally coupled scalar-tensor theories and test it against the full model-specific fluctuations. EOS We further study the relativistic effects in galaxy clustering for the normal and self-accelerating branches of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld model as well as for phenomenological modifications of gravity.	We quantify the impact of modified gravity and dark energy models on galaxy clustering by computing the velocity-to-matter density ratio F, the velocity contribution R, and the potential contribution P and give an estimate of their detectability in future galaxy surveys.

doc	Split Hamiltonian Monte Carlo EOS We show how the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm can sometimes be speeded up by "splitting" the Hamiltonian in a way that allows much of the movement around the state space to be done at low computational cost. EOS One context where this is possible is when the log density of the distribution of interest (the potential energy function) can be written as the log of a Gaussian density, which is a quadratic function, plus a slowly varying function. EOS Hamiltonian dynamics for quadratic energy functions can be analytically solved. EOS With the splitting technique, only the slowly-varying part of the energy needs to be handled numerically, and this can be done with a larger stepsize (and hence fewer steps) than would be necessary with a direct simulation of the dynamics. EOS Another context where splitting helps is when the most important terms of the potential energy function and its gradient can be evaluated quickly, with only a slowly-varying part requiring costly computations. EOS With splitting, the quick portion can be handled with a small stepsize, while the costly portion uses a larger stepsize.	We show that both of these splitting approaches can reduce the computational cost of sampling from the posterior distribution for a logistic regression model, using either a Gaussian approximation centered on the posterior mode, or a Hamiltonian split into a term that depends on only a small number of critical cases, and another term that involves the larger number of cases whose influence on the posterior distribution is small.

And we predict their two-body strong decays by means of a phenomenology quark pair creation model.

doc	Faster Randomized Branching Algorithms for _EQN_ -SAT EOS The problem of determining if an _EQN_ -CNF boolean formula _EQN_ over _EQN_ variables is satisifiable reduces to the problem of determining if _EQN_ has a satisfying assignment with a Hamming distance of at most _EQN_ from a fixed assignment _EQN_. EOS This problem is also a very important subproblem in Schoning's local search algorithm for _EQN_ -SAT. EOS While Schoning described a randomized algorithm solves this subproblem in _EQN_ time, Dantsin et al presented a deterministic branching algorithm with _EQN_ running time. EOS In this paper we present a simple randomized branching algorithm that runs in time _EQN_. EOS As a consequence we get a randomized algorithm for _EQN_ -SAT that runs in _EQN_ time. EOS This algorithm matches the running time of Schoning's algorithm for 3-SAT and is an improvement over Schoning's algorithm for all _EQN_. EOS For _EQN_ -uniform hitting set parameterized by solution size _EQN_, we describe a randomized FPT algorithm with a running time of _EQN_.	For the above LP guarantee parameterization of vertex cover, we have a randomized FPT algorithm to find a vertex cover of size _EQN_ in a running time of _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the LP optimum of the natural LP relaxation of vertex cover.
doc	Power Assignment Problems in Wireless Communication EOS A fundamental class of problems in wireless communication is concerned with the assignment of suitable transmission powers to wireless devices/stations such that the resulting communication graph satisfies certain desired properties and the overall energy consumed is minimized. EOS Many concrete communication tasks in a wireless network like broadcast, multicast, point-to-point routing, creation of a communication backbone, etc. EOS can be regarded as such a power assignment problem. EOS This paper considers several problems of that kind; EOS for example one problem studied before in REF Carrots, Bilo aims to select and assign powers to _EQN_ of the stations such that all other stations are within reach of at least one of the selected stations. EOS We improve the running time for obtaining a _EQN_ -approximate solution for this problem from _EQN_ as reported by Bilo et al (\cite Bilo) to _EQN_ that is, we obtain a running time that is ph linear in the network size.	Further results include a constant approximation algorithm for the TSP problem under squared (non-metric!
doc	Static spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-Yang-Mills-dilaton black hole and its thermodynamics EOS In this work a static spherically symmetric black hole's solution within the Einstein-Maxwell-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory is derived. EOS The obtained solution is examined, in particular, we have calculated the Kretschmann scalar which allowed us to characterize singularity points. EOS Using the obtained black hole's solution we have studied its thermodynamics. EOS Namely, the temperature was calculated, the first law was written, and the heat capacity was studied. EOS The extended thermodynamics approach is utilized to obtain the equation of state. EOS Within the extended thermodynamics the Gibbs free energy is derived and investigated.	The analysis of the Gibbs free energy shows that below the critical temperature besides the first order phase transition in addition the zeroth order phase transition occurs, what is typical for other types of black holes with dilaton fields.
doc	Enabling Privacy-preserving Auctions in Big Data EOS We study how to enable auctions in the big data context to solve many upcoming data-based decision problems in the near future. EOS We consider the characteristics of the big data including, but not limited to, velocity, volume, variety, and veracity, and we believe any auction mechanism design in the future should take the following factors into consideration: 1) generality (variety); EOS 2) efficiency and scalability (velocity and volume); EOS 3) truthfulness and verifiability (veracity). EOS In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving construction for auction mechanism design in the big data, which prevents adversaries from learning unnecessary information except those implied in the valid output of the auction. EOS More specifically, we considered one of the most general form of the auction (to deal with the variety), and greatly improved the the efficiency and scalability by approximating the NP-hard problems and avoiding the design based on garbled circuits (to deal with velocity and volume), and finally prevented stakeholders from lying to each other for their own benefit (to deal with the veracity). EOS We achieve these by introducing a novel privacy-preserving winner determination algorithm and a novel payment mechanism.	Additionally, we further employ a blind signature scheme as a building block to let bidders verify the authenticity of their payment reported by the auctioneer.

doc	Tau polarization measurements at the LHC in supersymmetric models with a long-lived stau EOS Supersymmetry (SUSY) with a long-lived stau is an attractive scenario in the LHC experiments because one can directly observe stau tracks in each SUSY event, and thus precise measurements of SUSY particle masses are possible. EOS In this scenario, we discuss the possibility to observe/measure parity violation in interactions among SUSY particles. EOS Such a measurement will be important in determining spins and chiralities of SUSY particles. EOS We use the last step of the cascade-decay chain: _EQN_, where the polarization of the tau lepton can be determined statistically by looking at the energy distribution of the final state lepton.	Comparing with the theoretical formula of the neutralino differential decay width, one can extract the size of parity violation in the interaction vertices among the stau, the tau lepton and the neutralino.

We provide a principled method, grounded on reachability analysis and on Bayesian inference, to compute the confidence that a physical system driven by external inputs and accessed under noisy measurements, verifies a temporal logic property.
doc	A solution for reducing high bias in estimates of stored carbon in tropical forests (aboveground biomass) EOS A nondestructive method for estimating the amount of carbon stored by individuals, communities, vegetation types, and coverages, as well as their volume and aboveground biomass, is presented. EOS This methodology is based on information on carbon stocks obtained through three-dimensional analysis of tree architecture and artificial neural networks. EOS This technique accurately incorporates the diversity of plant forms measured in plots, transects, and relev\'es. EOS Stored carbon in any vegetation type is usually calculated as half the biomass of sampled individuals, estimated with allometric formulas. EOS The most complete of these formulas incorporate diameter, height, and specific gravity of wood but do not consider the variation in carbon stored in different organs or different species, nor do they include information on the wide array of architectures present in different plant communities. EOS To develop these allometric models, many individuals of different species must be sacrificed to identify and validate samples and to minimize error. EOS It is common to find cutting-edge studies that encourage logging to improve estimates of carbon. EOS In our approach we replace this destructive methodology with a new technique for quantifying global aboveground carbon.	We demonstrate that carbon content in forest aboveground biomass in the pantropics could rise to 723.97 Pg C.
doc	Planar flows and Pl\"ucker's type quadratic relations over semirings EOS It is well known, due to Lindstr\"om, that the minors of a (real or complex) matrix can be expressed in terms of weights of flows in a planar directed graph. EOS Another classical fact is that there are plenty of homogeneous quadratic relations involving flag minors, or Pl\"ucker coordinates of the corresponding flag manifold.	Generalizing and unifying these facts and their tropical counterparts, we consider a wide class of functions on _EQN_ that are generated by flows in a planar graph and take values in an arbitrary commutative semiring, where _EQN_.

doc	A drift homogenization problem revisited EOS This paper revisits a homogenization problem studied by L. EOS Tartar related to a tridimensional Stokes equation perturbed by a drift (connected to the Coriolis force). EOS Here, a scalar equation and a two-dimensional Stokes equation with a _EQN_ -bounded oscillating drift are considered. EOS Under higher integrability conditions the Tartar approach based on the oscillations test functions method applies and leads to a limit equation with an extra zero-order term. EOS When the drift is only assumed to be equi-integrable in _EQN_, the same limit behaviour is obtained. EOS However, the lack of integrability makes difficult the direct use of the Tartar method. EOS A new method in the context of homogenization theory is proposed.	It is based on a parametrix of the Laplace operator which permits to write the solution of the equation as a solution of a fixed point problem, and to use truncated functions even in the vector-valued case.
doc	A New Perspective on the Role of A-site Cation in Perovskite Solar Cells EOS As the race towards higher efficiency for inorganic/organic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is becoming highly competitive, a design scheme to maximize carrier transport towards higher power efficiency has been urgently demanded. EOS Here, we unravel a hidden role of A-site cation of PSCs in carrier transport which has been largely neglected, i.e., tuning the Frohlich electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling of longitudinal optical (LO) phonon by A-site cations. EOS The key for steering Frohlich polaron is to control the interaction strength and the number of proton (or lithium) coordination to halide ion. EOS The coordination to I alleviates electron-phonon scattering by either decreasing the Born effective charge or absorbing the LO motion of I.	This novel principle discloses lower electron-phonon coupling by several promising organic cations including hydroxyl-ammonium cation (NH _EQN_ OH _EQN_) and possibly Li _EQN_ solvating methylamine (Li _EQN_ NH _EQN_ CH _EQN_) than methyl-ammonium cation.
doc	The _EQN_ -ray strength function for Thallium isotopes relevant to the _EQN_ Pb - _EQN_ Tl chronometry EOS Photoneutron cross sections were measured for _EQN_ Tl and _EQN_ Tl at energies between the one- and two-neutron thresholds using quasi-monochromatic _EQN_ -ray beams produced in laser Compton-scattering at the NewSUBARU synchrotron radiation facility. EOS Our new measurement results in cross sections significantly different from the previously reported bremsstrahlung experiment, leading to rather different GDR parameters, in particular to lower GDR peak energies and higher peak cross sections.	The photoneutron data are used to constrain the _EQN_ -ray strength function on the basis of the Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov plus quasi-particle random phase approximation using the Gogny D1M interaction.
doc	The Hourglass as seen with HST/WFPC2 EOS We present a multi-filter HST/WFPC2 UV-optical study of the Hourglass region in M8. EOS We have extracted the stellar photometry of the sources in the area and obtained the separations and position angles of the Herschel 36 multiple system: for Herschel 36 D we detect a possible orbital motion between 1995 and 2009. EOS We have combined our data with archival IUE spectroscopy and measured the Herschel 36 extinction law, obtaining a different result from that of Cardelli et al (1989) due to the improvement in the quality of the optical-NIR data, in agreement with the results of Ma\'iz Apell\'aniz et al (2014). EOS A large fraction of the UV flux around Herschel 36 arises from the Hourglass and not directly from the star itself.	In the UV the Hourglass appears to act as a reflection nebula located behind Herschel 36 along the line of sight.
doc	Hybrid stars within a covariant, nonlocal chiral quark model EOS We present a hybrid equation of state (EoS) for dense matter in which a nuclear matter phase is described within the Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach and a two-flavor quark matter phase is modelled according to a recently developed covariant, nonlocal chiral quark model.	We show that modern observational constraints for compact star masses (M ~ 2 M_sun) can be satisfied when a small vector-like four quark interaction is taken into account.
doc	A three-parameter deformation of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra: differential calculus and invariance EOS We define a three-parameter deformation of the Weyl-Heisenberg algebra that generalizes the q-oscillator algebra.

doc	Quantum states of indefinite spins: From baryons to massive gravitino EOS I review theory and phenomenology of (K/2,K/2)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] states. EOS First I make the case that the observed nucleon and Delta (1232) excitations (up to Delta(1600)) are exhausted by unconstrained (K/2,K/2)*[(1/2,0)+(0,1/2)] states with K=1,3, and 5, which originate from rotational and vibrational excitations of an underlying quark--diquark configuration. EOS Second, I consider the simplest case of K=1 and show that the \gamma^\mu\psi_\mu =0 constraint of the Rarita-Schwinger framework is a short-hand of: - 1/3 (1/m^2 W^2 +3/4)\psi_\mu = \psi_\mu, the covariant definition of the unique invariant subspace of the squared Pauli-Lubanski vector, W^2, that is a parity singlet and of highest spin-3/2 at rest.	I suggest to work in the 16 dimensional vector spinor space \Psi= A *\psi rather than keeping Lorentz and spinor indices separated and show that the above second order equation guarantees the covariant description of a has-been spin-3/2 states at rest without invoking further supplementary conditions.
doc	Graphene-based extremely wide-angle tunable metamaterial absorber EOS We investigate the absorption properties of graphene-based anisotropic metamaterial structures where the metamaterial layer possesses an electromagnetic response corresponding to a near-zero permittivity. EOS We find that through analytical and numerical studies, near perfect absorption arises over an unusually broad range of beam incidence angles.	Due to the presence of graphene, the absorption is tunable via a gate voltage, providing dynamic control of the energy transmission.
doc	Bilocal expansion of the Borel amplitude and the hadronic tau decay width EOS The singular part of Borel transform of a QCD amplitude near the infrared renormalon can be expanded in terms of higher order Wilson coefficients of the operators associated with the renormalon. EOS In this paper we observe that this expansion gives nontrivial constraints on the Borel amplitude that can be used to improve the accuracy of the ordinary perturbative expansion of the Borel amplitude. EOS In particular, we consider the Borel transform of the Adler function and its expansion around the first infrared renormalon due to the gluon condensate. EOS Using the next-to-leading order Wilson coefficient of the gluon condensate operator, we obtain an exact constraint on the Borel amplitude at the first IR renormalon. EOS We then extrapolate, using judiciously chosen conformal transformations and Pade approximants, the ordinary perturbative expansion of the Borel amplitude in such a way that this constraint is satisfied. EOS This procedure allows us to predict the _EQN_ coefficient of the Adler function, which gives a result consistent with the estimate by Kataev and Starshenko using a completely different method.	We then apply this improved Borel amplitude to the tau decay width, and obtain the strong coupling constant _EQN_.

doc	Anisotropic Boltzmann-Gibbs dynamics of strongly magnetized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations EOS We consider various sets of Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equations modeling the dynamics of charged particles in a plasma under the effect of a strong magnetic field. EOS For each of them in a regime where the strength of the magnetic field is effectively stronger than that of collisions we first formally derive asymptotically reduced models. EOS In this regime, strong anisotropic phenomena occur; EOS while equilibrium along magnetic field lines is asymptotically reached our asymptotic models capture a non trivial dynamics in the perpendicular directions.	We do check that in any case the obtained asymptotic model defines a well-posed dynamical system and when self consistent electric fields are neglected we provide a rigorous mathematical justification of the formally derived systems.
doc	High Temperature Field Theory Beyond Perturbation Theory EOS For realistic values of the Higgs boson mass the high temperature electroweak phase transition cannot be described perturbatively. EOS The symmetric phase is governed by a strongly interacting _EQN_ gauge theory. EOS Typical masses of excitations and scales of condensates are set by the ``high temperature confinement scale'' _EQN_. EOS For a Higgs boson mass around 100 GeV or above all aspects of the phase transition are highly nonperturbative.	Near the critical temperature strong electroweak interactions are a dominant feature also in the phase with spontaneous symmetry breaking.
doc	Bound states for Overlap and Fixed Point Actions close to the chiral limit EOS We study the overlap and the fixed point Dirac operators for massive fermions in the two-flavor lattice Schwinger model.

doc	QCD evolution of naive-time-reversal-odd quark-gluon correlation functions EOS In this talk, we examine the existing calculations of QCD evolution kernels for the scale dependence of two sets of twist-3 quark-gluon correlation functions, _EQN_ and _EQN_, which are the first transverse-momentum-moment of the naive-time-reversal-odd Sivers and Boer-Mulders function, respectively.	The evolution kernels at the leading order in strong coupling constant _EQN_ were derived by several groups with apparent differences.
doc	Composite dark matter phenomenology in the presence of lighter degrees of freedom EOS Scalar singlet dark matter in anomaly-free composite Higgs models is accompanied by exotic particles to which the dark matter annihilates. EOS The latter can therefore freeze out even in the absence of couplings to the Standard Model. EOS In this regime, both current and future direct detection constraints can be avoided. EOS Moreover, due to the different decay modes of the extra particles, the dark matter candidate can even escape indirect detection constraints.	Assessing this issue requires dedicated simulations of the gamma ray spectrum, that we provide in the present article in the context of _EQN_.
doc	Search for long-lived, heavy particles in final states with a muon and multi-track displaced vertex in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector EOS Many extensions of the Standard Model posit the existence of heavy particles with long lifetimes. EOS In this Letter, results are presented of a search for such particles, which decay at a significant distance from their production point, using a final state containing charged hadrons and an associated muon. EOS This analysis uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s)= 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.4 fb-1 collected in 2011 by the ATLAS detector operating at the Large Hadron Collider. EOS Results are interpreted in the context of R-parity violating supersymmetric scenarios.	No events in the signal region are observed and limits are set on the production cross section for supersymmetric particles, multiplied by the square of the branching ratio for a neutralino to decay to charged hadrons and a muon, as a function of the neutralino lifetime.
doc	AdaScan: Adaptive Scan Pooling in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Human Action Recognition in Videos EOS We propose a novel method for temporally pooling frames in a video for the task of human action recognition. EOS The method is motivated by the observation that there are only a small number of frames which, together, contain sufficient information to discriminate an action class present in a video, from the rest. EOS The proposed method learns to pool such discriminative and informative frames, while discarding a majority of the non-informative frames in a single temporal scan of the video. EOS Our algorithm does so by continuously predicting the discriminative importance of each video frame and subsequently pooling them in a deep learning framework.	We show the effectiveness of our proposed pooling method on standard benchmarks where it consistently improves on baseline pooling methods, with both RGB and optical flow based Convolutional networks.
doc	Bio-Inspired Aggregation Control of Carbon Nanotubes for Ultra-Strong Composites EOS High performance nanocomposites require well dispersion and high alignment of the nanometer-sized components, at a high mass or volume fraction as well. EOS However, the road towards such composite structure is severely hindered due to the easy aggregation of these nanometer-sized components. EOS Here we demonstrate a big step to approach the ideal composite structure for carbon nanotube (CNT) where all the CNTs were highly packed, aligned, and unaggregated, with the impregnated polymers acting as interfacial adhesions and mortars to build up the composite structure. EOS The strategy was based on a bio-inspired aggregation control to limit the CNT aggregation to be sub 20--50 nm, a dimension determined by the CNT growth.	After being stretched with full structural relaxation in a multi-step way, the CNT/polymer (bismaleimide) composite yielded super-high tensile strengths up to 6.27--6.94 GPa, more than 100% higher than those of carbon fiber/epoxy composites, and toughnesses up to 117--192 MPa.

doc	Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation with Maximum Squares Loss EOS Deep neural networks for semantic segmentation always require a large number of samples with pixel-level labels, which becomes the major difficulty in their real-world applications. EOS To reduce the labeling cost, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches are proposed to transfer knowledge from labeled synthesized datasets to unlabeled real-world datasets. EOS Recently, some semi-supervised learning methods have been applied to UDA and achieved state-of-the-art performance. EOS One of the most popular approaches in semi-supervised learning is the entropy minimization method. EOS However, when applying the entropy minimization to UDA for semantic segmentation, the gradient of the entropy is biased towards samples that are easy to transfer. EOS To balance the gradient of well-classified target samples, we propose the maximum squares loss. EOS Our maximum squares loss prevents the training process being dominated by easy-to-transfer samples in the target domain. EOS Besides, we introduce the image-wise weighting ratio to alleviate the class imbalance in the unlabeled target domain. EOS Both synthetic-to-real and cross-city adaptation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.	The code is released at https://github.
doc	Leptophobic _EQN_ bosons in the secluded _EQN_ model EOS We perform a comprehensive analysis of the the secluded UMSSM model, consistent with present experimental constraints. EOS We find that in this model the additional _EQN_ gauge boson can be leptophobic without resorting to gauge kinetic mixing and, consequently, also _EQN_ -quark-phobic, thus lowering the LHC bounds on its mass. EOS The model can accommodate very light singlinos as DM candidates, consistent with present day cosmological and collider constraints.	Light charginos and neutralinos are responsible for muon anomalous magnetic predictions within 1 _EQN_ of the measured experimental value.
doc	Scaling Theory of _EQN_ Topological Invariants EOS For inversion-symmetric topological insulators and superconductors characterized by _EQN_ topological invariants, two scaling schemes are proposed to judge topological phase transitions driven by an energy parameter.	The scaling schemes renormalize either the phase gradient or the second derivative of the Pfaffian of the time-reversal operator, through which the renormalization group flow of the driving energy parameter can be obtained.

doc	The cost of controlling strongly degenerate parabolic equations EOS We consider the typical one-dimensional strongly degenerate parabolic operator _EQN_ with _EQN_ and _EQN_, controlled either by a boundary control acting at _EQN_, or by a locally distributed control. EOS Our main goal is to study the dependence of the so-called controllability cost needed to drive an initial condition to rest with respect to the degeneracy parameter _EQN_. EOS We prove that the control cost blows up with an explicit exponential rate, as _EQN_, when _EQN_ and/or _EQN_.	Our analysis builds on earlier results and methods (based on functional analysis and complex analysis techniques) developed by several authors such as Fattorini-Russel, Seidman, G\"uichal, Tenenbaum-Tucsnak and Lissy for the classical heat equation.

doc	Theory of Pendular Rings Revisited EOS We present the theory of liquid bridges between two axisymmetric solids, sphere and plane, with prescribed contact angles in a general setup, when the solids are non-touching, touching or intersecting, We give a detailed derivation of expressions for curvature, volume and surface area of pendular ring as functions of the filling angle \psi for all available types of menisci: catenoid Cat, sphere Sph, cylinder Cyl, nodoid Nod and unduloid Und (the meridional profile of the latter may have inflection points). EOS The Young-Laplace equation with boundary conditions can be viewed as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. EOS Its unduloid solutions, menisci shapes z_n^s(r) and their curvatures H_n^s(\psi), exhibit a discrete spectrum and are enumerated by two indices: the number n of inflection points on the meniscus meridional profile M and the convexity index s=\pm 1 determined by the shape of a segment of M contacting the solid sphere: the shape is either convex, s=1, or concave, s=-1. EOS For the fixed contact angles the set of the functions H_n^s(\psi) behaves in such a way that in the plane (\psi,H) there exists a bounded domain where H_n^s(\psi) do not exist for any distance between solids. EOS The curves H_n^s(\psi) may be tangent to the boundary of domain which is a smooth closed curve.	This topological representation allows to classify possible curves and introduce a saddle point notion.

This perspective, proposed by Miroslav Fiedler, introduces techniques from (simplex) geometry into the field of graph theory and conversely, via an exact correspondence.
doc	On Modular and Fully-Abstract Compilation -- Technical Appendix EOS Secure compilation studies compilers that generate target-level components that are as secure as their source-level counterparts. EOS Full abstraction is the most widely-proven property when defining a secure compiler. EOS A compiler is modular if it allows different components to be compiled independently and then to be linked together to form a whole program. EOS Unfortunately, many existing fully-abstract compilers to untyped machine code are not modular. EOS So, while fully-abstractly compiled components are secure from malicious attackers, if they are linked against each other the resulting component may become vulnerable to attacks. EOS This paper studies how to devise modular, fully-abstract compilers. EOS It first analyses the attacks arising when compiled programs are linked together, identifying security threats that are due to linking.	Then, it defines a compiler from an object-based language with method calls and dynamic memory allocation to untyped assembly language extended with a memory isolation mechanism.

doc	A minimal supersymmetric scenario with only \mu at the weak scale EOS Inspired by split supersymmetry, we study a minimal supersymmetric scenario with only the Higgsino mass parameter _EQN_ below the TeV scale. EOS The motivation is to satisfy the gauge coupling unification and dark matter constraints with the minimal particle contents at the electroweak scale in supersymmetric models. EOS With the neutral Higgsino as the lightest supersymmetric particle, we discuss the dark matter signals in both direct and indirect detection.	We also discuss collider phenomenology associated with the two lightest neutralinos and the lightest chargino, which are almost degenerate in mass even after taking into account radiative corrections.

For Gaussian random walks coupled to a thermal bath we recover ergodicity and Boltzmann's statistics, while for the anomalous subdiffusive case a weakly non-ergodic statistical mechanical framework is constructed, which is based on L\'evy's generalized central limit theorem.
doc	The Erd\H o s-Ko-Rado property for some permutation groups EOS A subset in a group _EQN_ is intersecting if for any pair of permutations _EQN_ in the subset there is an _EQN_ such that _EQN_. EOS If the stabilizer of a point is the largest intersecting set in a group, we say that the group has the Erd\H o s-Ko-Rado (EKR) property. EOS Moreover, the group has the strict EKR property if every intersecting set of maximum size in the group is either the stabilizer of a point or the coset of the stabilizer of a point. EOS In this paper we look at several families of permutation groups and determine if the groups have either the EKR property or the strict EKR property. EOS First, we prove that all cyclic groups have the strict EKR property. EOS Next we show that all dihedral and Frobenius groups have the EKR property and we characterize which ones have the strict EKR property.	Further, we show that if all the groups in an external direct sum or an internal direct sum have the EKR (or strict EKR) property, then the product does as well.
doc	A New Statistical Approach for Comparing Algorithms for Lexicon Based Sentiment Analysis EOS Lexicon based sentiment analysis usually relies on the identification of various words to which a numerical value corresponding to sentiment can be assigned. EOS In principle, classifiers can be obtained from these algorithms by comparison with human annotation, which is considered the gold standard. EOS In practise this is difficult in languages such as Portuguese where there is a paucity of human annotated texts. EOS Thus in order to compare algorithms, a next best step is to directly compare different algorithms with each other without referring to human annotation. EOS In this paper we develop methods for a statistical comparison of algorithms which does not rely on human annotation or on known class labels.	We will motivate the use of marginal homogeneity tests, as well as log linear models within the framework of maximum likelihood estimation We will also show how some uncertainties present in lexicon based sentiment analysis may be similar to those which occur in human annotated tweets.
doc	Understanding Scintillation of Intraday Variables EOS Intraday Variability of compact extragalactic radio sources can be interpreted as quenched scintillation due to turbulent density fluctuations of the nearby ionized interstellar medium. EOS We demonstrate that the statistical analysis of IDV time series contains both information about sub-structure of the source on the scale of several 10 micro-arcsec and about the turbulent state of the ISM. EOS The source structure and ISM properties cannot be disentangled using IDV observations alone.	A comparison with the known morphology of the `local bubble' and the turbulent ISM from pulsar observations constrains possible source models.

EOS In one spatial dimension, numerical analysis are performed by considering harmonic chains with either periodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions.	In the massless regime and for some configurations where the subsystem is a single interval, the numerical results for the contour function are compared to the inverse of the local weight function which multiplies the energy-momentum tensor in the corresponding entanglement hamiltonian, found through conformal field theory methods, and a good agreement is observed.
doc	Family Constraining of Iterative Algorithms EOS In constraining iterative processes, the algorithmic operator of the iterative process is pre-multiplied by a constraining operator at each iterative step. EOS This enables the constrained algorithm, besides solving the original problem, also to find a solution that incorporates some prior knowledge about the solution. EOS This approach has been useful in image restoration and other image processing situations when a single constraining operator was used.	In the field of image reconstruction from projections a priori information about the original image, such as smoothness or that it belongs to a certain closed convex set, may be used to improve the reconstruction quality.
doc	Perspectives and Challenges for QCD Phenomenology EOS A fundamental understanding of quantum chromodynamics, particularly at the amplitude level, is essential for progress in high energy physics. EOS For example, the measurement and interpretation of the basic parameters of the electroweak theory and CP violation depends on an understanding of the dynamics and phase structure of exclusive B-meson decay amplitudes. EOS In this review, I discuss a number of ways in which the required hadron wavefunctions can be measured (such as two-photon reactions and diffractive dissociation) or calculated from first principles. EOS An important tool for describing relativistic composite systems in quantum field theory is the light-front Fock expansion, which encodes the properties of a hadrons in terms of a set of frame-independent n-particle wavefunctions. EOS Evolution in light-cone time allows the construction of an "event amplitude generator" in which only non-ghost physical degrees of freedom and integration over physical phase appear. EOS The diffractive dissociation of a hadron at high energies, by either Coulomb or Pomeron exchange, has a natural description in QCD as the materialization of the projectile's light-cone wavefunctions; EOS in particular, the diffractive dissociation of a meson, baryon, or photon into high transverse momentum jets measures the shape and other features of the projectile's distribution amplitude.	I also review recent work which shows that the structure functions measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering are affected by final-state rescattering, thus modifying their connection with the light-cone probability distributions.

doc	The mass formula for an exotic BTZ black hole EOS An exotic Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole has an angular momentum larger than its mass in three dimension (3D), which suggests the possibility that cosmic censorship could be violated if angular momentum is extracted by the Penrose process. EOS In this paper, we propose a mass formula for the exotic BTZ black hole and show no violation of weak cosmic censorship in the gedanken process above by understanding properly its mass formula.	Unlike the other black holes, the total energy of the exotic BTZ black hole is represented by the angular momentum instead of the mass, which supports a basic point of view that the same geometry should be determined by the same energy in 3D general relativity whose equation of motion can be given either by normal 3D Einstein gravity or by exotic 3D Einstein gravity.
doc	Multi-nucleon bound states in _EQN_ lattice QCD EOS We report on our on-going effort to calculate the properties of light nuclei directly from quarks and gluons based on lattice QCD.	After briefly introducing our motivations and aims, we describe our strategy of fixing the strange quark mass at its physical value and approaching the physical point for the up and down quark masses step by step from the region of heavy quark masses.
doc	Transitions Between Hall Plateaus and the Dimerization Transition of a Hubbard Chain EOS We show that the plateau transitions in the quantum Hall effect is the same as the dimerization transition of a half-filled, one dimensional, _EQN_ Hubbard model at _EQN_.

doc	Model of Internal Friction Damping in Solids EOS A model for harmonic oscillator damping due to the internal friction of solids has been developed, based on considerations of a long period pendulum.	The assumption of a complex elastic modulus to describe stress-strain hysteresis in the support structure of the pendulum yields an expression for the figure of merit Q that agrees with many experiments involving material damping.
doc	Generation of Magnetic Fields in the Relativistic Shock of Gamma-Ray-Burst Sources EOS We show that the relativistic two-stream instability can naturally generate strong magnetic fields with 1e-5 - 1e-1 of the equipartition energy density, in the collisionless shocks of Gamma-Ray-Burst (GRB) sources. EOS The generated fields are parallel to the shock front and fluctuate on the very short scale of the plasma skin depth. EOS The synchrotron radiation emitted from the limb-brightened source image is linearly polarized in the radial direction relative to the source center.	Although the net polarization vanishes under circular symmetry, GRB sources should exhibit polarization scintillations as their radio afterglow radiation gets scattered by the Galactic interstellar medium.
doc	Peculiarity of the Coulombic Criticality? EOS We indicate that Coulombic systems could correspond to Wilson effective Hamiltonians similar to that of the ordinary (nonionic) fluids but with a negative _EQN_ -coefficient.	In that case, solving the ``exact'' renormalization group equation in the local potential approximation, we show that close initial Hamiltonians may lead either to a first order transition or to an Ising-like critical behavior, the partition being formed by the tri-critical surface.
doc	Modeling a nonperturbative spinor vacuum interacting with a strong gravitational wave EOS We consider the propagation of strong gravitational waves interacting with a nonperturbative vacuum of spinor fields. EOS To described the latter, we suggest an approximate model. EOS The corresponding Einstein equation has the form of the Schr\"odinger equation. EOS Its gravitational-wave solution is analogous to the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for an electron moving in a periodic potential. EOS The general solution for the periodic gravitational waves is found. EOS The analog of the Kronig-Penney model for gravitational waves is considered.	It is shown that the suggested gravitational-wave model permits the existence of weak electric charge and current densities concomitant with the gravitational wave.
doc	Fully discrete polynomial de Rham sequences of arbitrary degree on polygons and polyhedra EOS In this work, merging ideas from compatible discretisations and polyhedral methods, we construct novel fully discrete polynomial de Rham sequences of arbitrary degree on polygons and polyhedra. EOS The spaces and operators that appear in these sequences are directly amenable to computer implementation.	Besides proving exactness, we show that the usual sequence of Finite Element spaces forms, through appropriate interpolation operators, a commutative diagram with our sequence, which ensures suitable approximation properties.
doc	A fourth-order compact solver for fractional-in-time fourth-order diffusion equations EOS A fourth-order compact scheme is proposed for a fourth-order subdiffusion equation with the first Dirichlet boundary conditions. EOS The fourth-order problem is firstly reduced into a couple of spatially second-order system and we use an averaged operator to construct a fourth-order spatial approximation. EOS This averaged operator is compact since it involves only two grid points for the derivative boundary conditions. EOS The L1 formula on irregular mesh is considered for the Caputo fractional derivative, so we can resolve the initial singularity of solution by putting more grid points near the initial time.	The stability and convergence are established by using three theoretical tools: a complementary discrete convolution kernel, a discrete fractional Gronwall inequality and an error convolution structure.

It is found from these results that the _EQN_ - _EQN_ relation is determined by the vortex-unbinding mechanism with the KTB dynamic critical exponent _EQN_.

The CMA-ES is a stochastic and derivative-free method employed to search parameter space of the model by means of a fitness function.

EOS A classical channel at 1550 nm operates in parallel with a quantum channel at 845 nm. EOS Clock recovery techniques on the classical channel at 1.25 Gbps enable quantum transmission at up to the clock rate.	System performance is currently limited by the timing resolution of our silicon avalanche photodiode detectors.

doc	Wet-spinnability and crosslinked fibre properties of two collagen polypeptides with varied molecular weight EOS The formation of naturally-derived materials with wet stable fibrous architectures is paramount in order to mimic the features of tissues at the molecular and microscopic scale. EOS Here, we investigated the formation of wet-spun fibres based on collagen-derived polypeptides with comparable chemical composition and varied molecular weight. EOS Gelatin and hydrolysed fish collagen (HFC) were selected as widely-available linear amino-acidic chains of high and low molecular weight, respectively, and functionalised in the wet-spun fibre state in order to preserve the material geometry in physiological conditions. EOS Wet-spun fibre diameter and morphology were dramatically affected depending on the polypeptide molecular weight, wet-spinning solvent (i.e. EOS 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide) and coagulating medium (i.e. EOS acetone and ethanol), resulting in either bulky or porous internal geometry.	Dry-state tensile moduli were significantly enhanced in gelatin and HFC samples following covalent crosslinking with activated 1,3 phenylenediacetic acid (Ph) (E: 726 +/- 43 - 844 +/- 85 MPa), compared to samples crosslinked via intramolecular carbodiimide-mediated condensation reaction (E: 588 +/- 38 MPa).

doc	Sign refinement for combinatorial link Floer homology EOS Link Floer homology is an invariant for links which has recently been described entirely in a combinatorial way. EOS Originally constructed with mod 2 coefficients, it was generalized to integer coefficients thanks to a sign refinement.	In this paper, thanks to the spin extension of the permutation group we give an alternative construction of the combinatorial link Floer chain complex associated to a grid diagram with integer coefficients.
doc	Inherent correlations between thermodynamics and statistic physics in extensive and nonextensive systems EOS With the help of a general expression of the entropies in extensive and nonextensive systems, some important relations between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are revealed through the views of thermodynamics and statistic physics. EOS These relations are proved through the MaxEnt approach once again. EOS It is found that for a reversible isothermal process, the information contained in the first and second laws of thermodynamics and the MaxEnt approach is equivalent.	Moreover, these relations are used to derive the probability distribution functions in nonextensive and extensive statistics and calculate the generalized forces of some interesting systems.
doc	Ultralight Vector Dark Matter Search with Auxiliary Length Channels of Gravitational Wave Detectors EOS Recently, a considerable amount of attention has been given to the search for ultralight dark matter by measuring the oscillating length changes in the arm cavities of gravitational wave detectors. EOS Although gravitational wave detectors are extremely sensitive for measuring the differential arm length changes, the sensitivity to dark matter is largely attenuated, as the effect of dark matter is mostly common to arm cavity test masses. EOS Here, we propose to use auxiliary length channels, which measure the changes in the power and signal recycling cavity lengths and the differential Michelson interferometer length. EOS The sensitivity to dark matter can be enhanced by exploiting the fact that auxiliary interferometers are more asymmetric than two arm cavities.	We show that the sensitivity to _EQN_ gauge boson dark matter with masses below _EQN_ ~eV can be greatly enhanced when our method is applied to a cryogenic gravitational wave detector KAGRA, which employs sapphire test masses and fused silica auxiliary mirrors.
doc	Magnetic structure and high-field magnetization of the distorted kagome lattice antiferromagnet Cs _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ SnF _EQN_ EOS High-resolution time-of-flight powder neutron diffraction and high-field magnetization were measured to investigate the magnetic structure and existence of a field-induced magnetic phase transition in the distorted kagome antiferromagnet Cs _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ SnF _EQN_. EOS Upon cooling from room temperature, the compound undergoes a structural phase transition at _EQN_ K from the rhombohedral space group _EQN_ with the perfect kagome spin network to the monoclinic space group _EQN_ with the distorted kagome planes. EOS The distortion results in three inequivalent exchange interactions among the _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ spins that magnetically order below _EQN_ K. EOS Magnetization measured with a magnetic field applied within the kagome plane reveals small in-plane ferromagnetism resulting from spin canting.	On the other hand, the out-of-plane magnetization does not show a clear hysteresis loop of the ferromagnetic component nor a prominent anomaly up to 170 T, with the exception of the subtle knee-like bend around 90 T, which could indicate the 1/3 magnetization plateau.

doc	Significant Reduction of Graphene Thermal Conductivity by Phononic Crystal Structure EOS We studied the thermal conductivity of graphene phononic crystal (GPnC), also named as graphene nanomesh, by molecular dynamics simulations. EOS The dependences of thermal conductivity of GPnCs on both length and temperature are investigated. EOS It is found that the thermal conductivity of GPnCs is significantly lower than that of graphene and can be efficiently tuned by changing the porosity and period length. EOS For example, the ratio of thermal conductivity of GPnC to thermal conductivity of graphene can be changed from 0.1 to 0.01 when the porosity is changed from about 21% to 65%.	The phonon participation ratio spectra reveal that more phonon modes are localized in GPnCs with larger porosity.
doc	The Dixmier trace and the noncommutative residue for multipliers on compact manifolds EOS In this paper we give formulae for the Dixmier trace and the noncommutative residue (also called Wodzicki's residue) of pseudo-differential operators by using the notion of global symbol. EOS We consider both cases, compact manifolds with or without boundary. EOS Our analysis on the Dixmier trace of invariant pseudo-differential operators on closed manifolds will be based on the Fourier analysis associated to every elliptic and positive operator and the quantization process developed by Delgado and Ruzhansky.	In particular, for compact Lie groups this can be done by using the representation theory of the group in view of the Peter-Weyl theorem and the Ruzhansky-Turunen symbolic calculus.
doc	Molecular-absorption-induced thermal bistablity in PECVD silicon nitride microring resonators EOS The wavelength selective linear absorption in communication C-band is investigated in CMOS-processed PECVD silicon nitride rings. EOS In the overcoupled region, the linear absorption loss lowers the on-resonance transmission of a ring resonator and increases its overall quality factor. EOS Both the linear absorption and ring quality factor are maximized near 1520 nm.	The direct heating by phonon absorption leads to thermal optical bistable switching in PECVD silicon nitride based microring resonators.
doc	Does the entropy of the Universe tend to a maximum? EOS Ordinary, macroscopic systems, naturally tend to a state of maximum entropy compatible with their constraints.

doc	Condensation Energy and High Tc Superconductivity	From an analysis of the specific heat of one of the cuprate superconductors it is shown, that even if a large part of the experimental specific heat associated with the superconducting phase transition is due to fluctuations, this part must be counted when one tries to extract the condensation energy from the data.
doc	Magnetic Influences on the Solar Wind (Ph.D. Dissertation) EOS The steady, supersonic outflow from the Sun we call the solar wind was first posited in the 1950s and initial theories rightly linked the acceleration of the wind to the existence of the million-degree solar corona. EOS Still today, the wind acceleration mechanisms and the coronal heating processes remain unsolved challenges in solar physics. EOS In this work, I seek to answer a portion of the mystery by focusing on a particular acceleration process: Alfven waves launched by the motion of magnetic field footpoints in the photosphere. EOS The entire corona is threaded with magnetic loops and flux tubes that open up into the heliosphere. EOS I have sought a better understanding of the role these magnetic fields play in determining solar wind properties in open flux tubes. EOS After an introduction of relevant material, I discuss my parameter study of magnetic field profiles and the statistical understanding we can draw from the resulting steady-state wind. EOS In the chapter following, I describe how I extended this work to consider time dependence in the turbulent heating by Alfven waves in three dimensional simulations.	The bursty nature of this heating led to a natural next step that expands my work to include not only the theoretical, but also a project to analyze observations of small network jets in the chromosphere and transition region, and the underlying photospheric magnetic field that forms thresholds in jet production.
doc	Experimental characterization of coherent magnetization transport in a one-dimensional spin system EOS We experimentally characterize the non-equilibrium, room-temperature magnetization dynamics of a spin chain evolving under an effective double-quantum Hamiltonian. EOS We show that the Liouville space operators corresponding to the magnetization and the two-spin correlations evolve 90 degrees out of phase with each other, and drive the transport dynamics. EOS For a nearest-neighbor-coupled N-spin chain, the dynamics are found to be restricted to a Liouville operator space whose dimension scales only as N^2, leading to a slow growth of multi-spin correlations. EOS Even though long-range couplings are present in the real system, we find excellent agreement between the analytical predictions and our experimental results, confirming that leakage out of the restricted Liouville space is slow on the timescales investigated.	Our results indicate that the group velocity of the magnetization is 6.04 +/- 0.38 um/s, corresponding to a coherent transport over N ~ 26 spins on the experimental timescale.

doc	Search for R-parity violating decays of a top squark in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV EOS The results of a search for a supersymmetric partner of the top quark (top squark), pair-produced in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, are presented. EOS The search, which focuses on R-parity violating, chargino-mediated decays of the top squark, is performed in final states with low missing transverse momentum, two oppositely charged electrons or muons, and at least five jets. EOS The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2012.	The data are found to be in agreement with the standard model expectation, and upper limits are placed on the top squark pair production cross section at 95% confidence level.
doc	Comparative analysis of the semileptonic _EQN_ transition in SM and different SUSY scenarios using form factors from full QCD EOS We work out the semileptonic _EQN_ transition in standard as well as different supersymmetric models. EOS In particular, considering the parametrization of the matrix elements entered the low energy effective Hamiltonian in terms of form factors in full QCD, we calculate the amplitude and differential decay rate responsible for this decay channel in supersymmetric models.	We then use the form factors calculated via light cone QCD sum rules in full theory to analyze the differential branching ratio and lepton forward-backward asymmetry of this decay channel in different supersymmetric models and compare the obtained results with those of the standard model.
doc	First-order phase transitions in one-dimensional steady states EOS The steady states of the two-species (positive and negative particles) asymmetric exclusion model of Evans, Foster, Godreche and Mukamel are studied using Monte Carlo simulations. EOS We show that mean-field theory does not give the correct phase diagram. EOS On the first-order phase transition line which separates the CP-symmetric phase from the broken phase, the density profiles can be understood through an unexpected pattern of shocks. EOS In the broken phase the free energy functional is not a convex function but looks like a standard Ginzburg-Landau picture. EOS If a symmetry breaking term is introduced in the boundaries the Ginzburg-Landau picture remains and one obtains spinodal points. EOS The spectrum of the hamiltonian associated with the master equation was studied using numerical diagonalization.	There are massless excitations on the first-order phase transition line with a dynamical critical exponent z=2 as expected from the existence of shocks and at the spinodal points where we find _EQN_.
doc	Surface tension in the cold and dense chiral transition and astrophysical applications EOS The surface tension of cold and dense QCD phase transitions has appeared recently as a key ingredient in different astrophysical scenarios, ranging from core-colapse supernovae explosions to compact star structure. EOS If the surface tension is low enough, observable consequences are possible. EOS Its value is however not known from first-principle methods in QCD, calling for effective approaches. EOS Working within the framework of homogeneous nucleation by Langer, we discuss the steps that are needed to obtain the nucleation parameters from a given effective potential.	As a model for deriving the effective potential for the chiral transition, we adopt the linear sigma model with constituent quarks at very low temperatures, which provides an effective description for the thermodynamics of the strong interaction in cold and dense matter, and predict a surface tension of Sigma ~ 5--15 MeV/fm^2, well below previous estimates.
doc	A topological version of the Bergman property EOS A topological group G is defined to have property (OB) if any G-action by isometries on a metric space, which is separately continuous, has bounded orbits. EOS We study this topological analogue of the socalled Bergman property in the context of Polish groups, where we show it to have several interesting reformulations and consequences.	We subsequently apply the results obtained in order to verify property (OB) for a number of groups of isometries and homeomorphism groups of compact metric spaces.

doc	New stellar constraints on dark photons EOS We consider the stellar production of vector states V within the minimal model of "dark photons". EOS We show that when the Stuckelberg mass of the dark vector becomes smaller than plasma frequency, the emission rate is dominated by the production of the longitudinal modes of V, and scales as \kappa^2 m_V^2, where \kappa and m_V are the mixing angle with the photon and the mass of the dark state. EOS This is in contrast with earlier erroneous claims in the literature that the emission rate decouples as the forth power of the mass.	We derive ensuing constraints on the (\kappa, m_V) parameter space by calculating the cooling rates for the Sun and red giant stars.

doc	On the notion of quantum Lyapunov exponent EOS Classical chaos refers to the property of trajectories to diverge exponentially as time tends to infinity. EOS It is characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent. EOS There are many different descriptions of quantum chaos. EOS The one related to the notion of generalized (quantum) Lyapunov exponent is based either on qualitative physical considerations or on the so-called symplectic tomography map.	The purpose of this note is to show how the definition of quantum Lyapunov exponent naturally arises in the framework of the Moyal phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and is based on the notions of quantum trajectories and the family of quantizers.
doc	CosmoBolognaLib: C++ libraries for cosmological calculations EOS We present the CosmoBolognaLib, a large set of Open Source C++ numerical libraries for cosmological calculations. EOS CosmoBolognaLib is a living project aimed at defining a common numerical environment for cosmological investigations of the large-scale structure of the Universe. EOS In particular, one of the primary focuses of this software is to help in handling astronomical catalogues, both real and simulated, measuring one-point, two-point and three-point statistics in configuration space, and performing cosmological analyses.

doc	That Was Then, This Is Now: A Security Evaluation of Password Generation, Storage, and Autofill in Thirteen Password Managers EOS Password managers have the potential to help users more effectively manage their passwords and address many of the concerns surrounding password-based authentication, however prior research has identified significant vulnerabilities in existing password managers. EOS Since that time, five years has passed, leaving it unclear whether password managers remain vulnerable or whether they are now ready for broad adoption. EOS To answer this question, we evaluate thirteen popular password managers and consider all three stages of the password manager lifecycle--password generation, storage, and autofill. EOS Our evaluation is the first analysis of password generation in password managers, finding several non-random character distributions and identifying instances where generated passwords were vulnerable to online and offline guessing attacks. EOS For password storage and autofill, we replicate past evaluations, demonstrating that while password managers have improved in the half-decade since those prior evaluations, there are still significant issues, particularly with browser-based password managers;	these problems include unencrypted metadata, unsafe defaults, and vulnerabilities to clickjacking attacks.
doc	A highly collimated, extremely high velocity outflow in Taurus EOS We present the first case of a highly collimated, extremely high velocity bipolar outflow in Taurus. EOS It is powered by the low-luminosity (0.4 L_sun) source IRAS 04166+2706 and contains gas accelerated up to 50 km/s with respect to the ambient cloud both toward the blue and the red (uncorrected for projection). EOS At the highest velocities, the outflow collimation factor exceeds 20, and the gas displays a very high degree of spatial symmetry.	This very fast gas presents multiple maxima, and most likely arises from the acceleration of ambient material by a time-variable jet-like stellar wind.

EOS We present explicit formulae for the complete corrections and a set of compact approximations which hold over the unified parameter space associated with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. EOS We illustrate the importance of the corrections and the accuracy of our approximations by scanning over the parameter space. EOS We calculate the supersymmetric one-loop corrections to the W-boson mass, the effective weak mixing angle, and the quark and lepton masses, and discuss implications for gauge and Yukawa coupling unification.	We also compute the one-loop corrections to the entire superpartner and Higgs-boson mass spectrum.
doc	Adams operations in cohomotopy EOS We study a collection of operations on the cohomotopy of any space, with which it becomes a "beta-ring", an algebraic structure analogous to a lambda-ring. EOS In particular, this ring possesses Adams operations, represented by maps on the infinite loop space of the sphere spectrum. EOS We compute their effect in homotopy on the image of J, and in mod 2 cohomology.	The motivation comes from the interpretation of the symmetric group as the general linear group of the "field with one element", which leads to an analogy between cohomotopy and algebraic K-theory.
doc	Characterizing Dust Attenuation in Local Star Forming Galaxies: UV and Optical Reddening EOS The dust attenuation for a sample of _EQN_ 10000 local (_EQN_) star forming galaxies is constrained as a function of their physical properties. EOS We utilize aperture-matched multi-wavelength data available from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to ensure that regions of comparable size in each galaxy are being analyzed. EOS We follow the method of Calzetti et al (1994) and characterize the dust attenuation through the UV power-law index, _EQN_, and the dust optical depth, which is quantified using the difference in Balmer emission line optical depth, _EQN_. EOS The observed linear relationship between _EQN_ and _EQN_ is similar to the local starburst relation, but the large scatter (_EQN_) suggests there is significant variation in the local Universe. EOS We derive a selective attenuation curve over the range _EQN_ and find that a single attenuation curve is effective for characterizing the majority of galaxies in our sample. EOS This curve has a slightly lower selective attenuation in the UV compared to previously determined curves. EOS We do not see evidence to suggest that a 2175\AA\ feature is significant in the average attenuation curve.	Significant positive correlations are seen between the amount of UV and optical reddening and galaxy metallicity, mass, star formation rate (SFR), and SFR surface density.
doc	Gravitating Yang-Mills dyon vortices in 4+1 spacetime dimensions EOS We consider vortex-type solutions in _EQN_ dimensions of the Einstein gravity coupled to a nonabelian SU(2) field posessing a nonzero electric part.

EOS It includes the mean transformation which is defined by S. EOS H. EOS Lee, W. EOS Y. EOS Lee and Yoon. EOS Next we shall give some properties of it.	Especially, we shall show that the _EQN_ -th iteration of mean transformation of an invertible matrix converges to a normal matrix.
doc	Higgs-Inflaton Symbiosis, Cosmological Constant Problem and Superacceleration Phase of the Universe in Two Measures Field Theory with Spontaneously Broken Scale Invariance EOS We study the scalar sector of the Two Measures Field Theory (TMT) model in the context of cosmological dynamics. EOS The scalar sector includes the inflaton \phi and the Higgs \upsilon fields. EOS The model possesses gauge and scale invariance. EOS The latter is spontaneously broken due to intrinsic features of the TMT dynamics. EOS In the model with the inflaton \phi alone, in different regions of the parameter space the following different effects can take place without fine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions: a) Possibility of resolution of the old cosmological constant problem: this is done in a consistent way hinted by S. EOS Weinberg in his comment concerning the question of how one can avoid his no-go theorem. EOS b) The power law inflation without any fine tuning may end with damped oscillations of _EQN_ around the state with zero cosmological constant. EOS c) There are regions of the parameters where the equation-of-state w=p/\rho in the late time universe is w<-1 and w asymptotically (as t\to\infty) approaches -1 from below. EOS This effect is achieved without any exotic term in the action. EOS In a model with both \phi and \upsilon fields, a scenario which resembles the hybrid inflation is realized but there are essential differences, for example: the Higgs field undergos transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase <\upsilon>\neq 0 soon after the end of a power law inflation;	there are two oscillatory regimes of \upsilon, one around \upsilon =0 at 50 e-folding before the end of inflation, another - during transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase where the scalar dark energy density approaches zero without fine tuning;
doc	Stabilized leapfrog based local time-stepping method for the wave equation EOS Local time-stepping methods permit to overcome the severe stability constraint on explicit methods caused by local mesh refinement without sacrificing explicitness. EOS In REF DiazGrote09, a leapfrog based explicit local time-stepping (LF-LTS) method was proposed for the time integration of second-order wave equations. EOS Recently, optimal convergence rates were proved for a conforming FEM discretization, albeit under a CFL stability condition where the global time-step, _EQN_, depends on the smallest elements in the mesh REF grote_sauter_1. EOS In general one cannot improve upon that stability constraint, as the LF-LTS method may become unstable at certain discrete values of _EQN_.	To remove those critical values of _EQN_, we apply a slight modification (as in recent work on LF-Chebyshev methods REF CarHocStu19) to the original LF-LTS method which nonetheless preserves its desirable properties: it is fully explicit, second-order accurate, satisfies a three-term (leapfrog like) recurrence relation, and conserves the energy.
doc	Twist-2 Heavy Flavor Contributions to the Structure Function _EQN_ EOS The twist--2 heavy flavor contributions to the polarized structure function _EQN_ are calculated.	We show that this part of _EQN_ is related to the heavy flavor contribution to _EQN_ by the Wandzura--Wilczek relation to all orders in the strong coupling constant.
doc	Distributed Kalman-filtering: Distributed optimization viewpoint EOS We consider the Kalman-filtering problem with multiple sensors which are connected through a communication network. EOS If all measurements are delivered to one place called fusion center and processed together, we call the process centralized Kalman-filtering (CKF). EOS When there is no fusion center, each sensor can also solve the problem by using local measurements and exchanging information with its neighboring sensors, which is called distributed Kalman-filtering (DKF).	Noting that CKF problem is a maximum likelihood estimation problem, which is a quadratic optimization problem, we reformulate DKF problem as a consensus optimization problem, resulting in that DKF problem can be solved by many existing distributed optimization algorithms.
doc	Observation of a d-wave nodal liquid in highly underdoped Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_ 8+\delta EOS We use angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe the electronic excitations of the non-superconducting state that exists between the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator at zero doping and the superconducting state at larger dopings in Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_ 8+\delta. EOS We find that this state is a nodal liquid whose excitation gap becomes zero only at points in momentum space.	Despite exhibiting a resistivity characteristic of an insulator and the absence of coherent quasiparticle peaks, this material has the same gap structure as the d-wave superconductor.
doc	Interpreting the X-ray Flash XRF 060218 and its associated supernova EOS Forty years after their discovery, and in spite of a very large body of observations, the operation of the 'engine' responsible for long-duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and X-ray flashes --as well as the mechanisms generating their radiation-- are still the subject of debate and study. EOS In this respect a recent event, XRF 060218, associated with SN 2006aj, is particularly significant. EOS It has been argued that, for the first time, the break-out of the shock involved in the supernova explosion has been observed, thanks to the detection of a thermal component in the event's radiation; EOS that this XRF was not a GRB seen 'off-axis', but a member of a new class of energetically feeble GRBs;	and that its 'continued engine activity' may have been driven by a remnant highly-magnetized neutron star, a magnetar.
doc	A Two Parameter Deformation of the SU(1/1) Superalgebra and the XY Quantum Chain in a Magnetic Field EOS We show that the XY quantum chain in a magnetic field is invariant under a two parameter deformation of the SU(1/1) superalgebra.	One is led to an extension of the braid group and the Hecke algebra which reduce to the known ones when the two parameter coincide.
doc	Loop expansion and the bosonic representation of loop quantum gravity EOS We introduce a new loop expansion that provides a resolution of the identity in the Hilbert space of loop quantum gravity on a fixed graph. EOS We work in the bosonic representation obtained by the canonical quantization of the spinorial formalism.	The resolution of the identity gives a tool for implementing the projection of states in the full bosonic representation onto the space of solutions to the Gauss and area matching constraints of loop quantum gravity.
doc	On the Stability and Gelfand Property of Symmetric Pairs EOS A symmetric pair of reductive groups _EQN_ is called stable, if every closed double coset of _EQN_ in _EQN_ is preserved by the anti-involution _EQN_.	In this paper, we develop a method to verify the stability of symmetric pairs over local fields of characteristic 0 (Archimedean and _EQN_ -adic), using non-abelian group cohomology.

doc	Weak magnetic field corrections to light vector or axial mesons mixings and vector meson dominance EOS Weak magnetic field induced corrections to effective coupling constants describing light vector mesons mixings and vector meson dominance (VMD) are derived. EOS The magnetic field must be weak with respect to an effective quark mass _EQN_ such that: _EQN_ or _EQN_.For that, a flavor SU(2) quark-quark interaction due to non perturbative one gluon exchange is considered. EOS By means of methods usually applied to the Nambu Jona Lasinio (NJL) and Global Color Models (GCM), leading light vector/axial mesons couplings to a background electromagnetic field are derived. EOS The corresponding effective coupling constants are resolved in the structureless mesons and longwavelength limits. EOS Some of the resulting coupling constants are redefined such as to become magnetic field induced corrections to vector or axial mesons couplings. EOS Due to the approximated chiral symmetry of the model, light axial mesons mixings induced by the magnetic field are also obtained. EOS Some numerical estimates are presented for the coupling constants and for some of the corresponding momentum dependent vertices.	The contributions of the induced VMD and vector mesons mixing couplings for the low momentum pion electromagnetic form factor and for the (off shell) charge symmetry violation potential at the constituent quark level are estimated.
doc	On a new class of fractional difference-sum operators based on discrete Atangana-Baleanu sums EOS We formulate a new class of fractional difference and sum operators, study their fundamental properties, and find their discrete Laplace transforms. EOS The method depends on iterating the fractional sum operators corresponding to fractional differences with discrete Mittag-Leffler kernels.	The iteration process depends on the binomial theorem.
doc	Weak multiplier bialgebras EOS A non-unital generalization of weak bialgebra is proposed with a multiplier-valued comultiplication. EOS Certain canonical subalgebras of the multiplier algebra (named the `base algebras') are shown to carry coseparable co-Frobenius coalgebra structures.	Appropriate modules over a weak multiplier bialgebra are shown to constitute a monoidal category via the (co)module tensor product over the base algebra.
doc	Auditing a collection of races simultaneously EOS A collection of races in a single election can be audited as a group by auditing a random sample of batches of ballots and combining observed discrepancies in the races represented in those batches in a particular way: the maximum across-race relative overstatement of pairwise margins (MARROP). EOS A risk-limiting audit for the entire collection of races can be built on this ballot-based auditing using a variety of probability sampling schemes.	The audit controls the familywise error rate (the chance that one or more incorrect outcomes fails to be corrected by a full hand count) at a cost that can be lower than that of controlling the per-comparison error rate with independent audits.
doc	Laplacian Smoothing Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo EOS As an important Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) algorithm has achieved great success in Bayesian learning and posterior sampling. EOS However, SGLD typically suffers from slow convergence rate due to its large variance caused by the stochastic gradient. EOS In order to alleviate these drawbacks, we leverage the recently developed Laplacian Smoothing (LS) technique and propose a Laplacian smoothing stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (LS-SGLD) algorithm. EOS We prove that for sampling from both log-concave and non-log-concave densities, LS-SGLD achieves strictly smaller discretization error in _EQN_ -Wasserstein distance, although its mixing rate can be slightly slower.	Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets verify our theoretical results, and demonstrate the superior performance of LS-SGLD on different machine learning tasks including posterior sampling, Bayesian logistic regression and training Bayesian convolutional neural networks.

doc	Deforming Calabi-Yau Threefolds EOS This paper first generalises the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov unobstructedness theorem to the case of Calabi-Yau threefolds with canonical singularities. EOS The deformation space of such a Calabi-Yau threefold is no longer smooth, but the general principle is that the obstructions to deforming such a threefold are precisely the obstructions to deforming the singularities of the threefold. EOS Secondly, these results are applied to smoothing singular Calabi-Yau threefolds with crepant resolutions.	Any such Calabi-Yau threefold with isolated complete intersection singularities which are not ordinary double points is smoothable.
doc	Framework for a Decentralized Web EOS Over the past decade, we have witnessed the Internet becoming increasingly centralized in the hands of a small number of giant technology firms, that control many of the most popular applications and the content they host on their platforms. EOS In addition, in the majority of instances today, access to the Internet is usually provided through local internet service providers (ISPs) in each country. EOS Governments in different jurisdictions can exert pressure on these technology firms and ISPs to enforce restrictions on Internet usage by their citizens, such as the blocking access to certain sites and/or content. EOS In this paper, we present a promising new approach to circumventing some of these issues. EOS Our decentralized web (DWeb) proposal makes use of a mesh network to connect community based routers.	In addition, objects on the DWeb are indexed using Bblockchain technology, which allows for secure storage of immutable object references, and integrity checking of the data being served to users.
doc	H _EQN_ intensity map of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 host galaxy from Subaru/Kyoto 3DII AO-assisted optical integral-field spectroscopy EOS We present the H _EQN_ intensity map of the host galaxy of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 at a redshift of z=0.193 obtained with the AO-assisted Kyoto 3DII optical integral-field unit mounted on the 8.2-m Subaru Telescope. EOS We detected a compact H _EQN_ -emitting (i.e., star-forming) region in the galaxy, which has a much smaller angular size [ _EQN_ (1.9 kpc) at full width at half maximum (FWHM)] than the extended stellar continuum emission region determined by the Gemini/GMOS z'-band image [ _EQN_ (4.6 kpc) at FWHM with ellipticity b/a=0.45]. EOS The spatial offset between the centroid of the H _EQN_ emission region and the position of the radio bursts is _EQN_ (_EQN_ kpc), indicating that FRB 121102 is located within the star-forming region.	This close spatial association of FRB 121102 with the star-forming region is consistent with expectations from young pulsar/magnetar models for FRB 121102, and it also suggests that the observed H _EQN_ emission region can make a major dispersion measure (DM) contribution to the host galaxy DM component of FRB 121102.
doc	On twisted higher-rank graph C*-algebras EOS We define the categorical cohomology of a k-graph \Lambda\ and show that the first three terms in this cohomology are isomorphic to the corresponding terms in the cohomology defined in our previous paper. EOS This leads to an alternative characterisation of the twisted k-graph C*-algebras introduced there.	We prove a gauge-invariant uniqueness theorem and use it to show that every twisted k-graph C*-algebra is isomorphic to a twisted groupoid C*-algebra.
doc	The generalized hardness-intensity diagram for black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries EOS Over the past half century, X-ray and radio observations of accreting neutron stars and stellar mass black holes have yielded a rich observational picture with common features including state transitions and jet formation, but also sharp differences. EOS While black hole X-ray binaries overwhelmingly suppress jets in so-called soft states, accreting neutron stars are less restrictive, with a soft state wind observed in some sources to co-exist with a jet. EOS We propose an explanation for these differences that leads to a generalization of a foundational element, the hardness-intensity diagram of Fender et al (2004).	The inverse relation between jets and winds fits into a picture that connects to prograde accretion while the possibility of counterrotation between accretion disk and compact object accounts for observed differences in accreting neutron stars.

EOS We developed an effective code for the single-scan version of the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm. EOS We measured the probabilities on the square lattice forming samples of rectangular strips with widths from 8 to 256 sites and lengths up to 3200 sites. EOS At total of more than _EQN_ random numbers are generated for the sampling procedure.	Our data confirm the proposed exact formulaes for the probability exponents conjectured recently on the base of 2D conformal field theory.

doc	Final-state interactions in inclusive deep-inelastic scattering from the deuteron EOS We explore the role of final-state interactions (FSI) in inclusive deep-inelastic scattering from the deuteron. EOS Relating the inclusive cross section to the deuteron forward virtual Compton scattering amplitude, a general formula for the FSI contribution is derived in the generalized eikonal approximation, utilizing the diffractive nature of the effective hadron-nucleon interaction. EOS The calculation uses a factorized model with a basis of three resonances with mass _EQN_ GeV and a continuum contribution for larger _EQN_ as the relevant set of effective hadron states entering the final-state interaction amplitude.	The results show sizeable on-shell FSI contributions for Bjorken _EQN_ and _EQN_ GeV _EQN_, increasing in magnitude for lower _EQN_, but vanishing in the high- _EQN_ limit due to phase space constraints.
doc	DarkHistory: A code package for calculating modified cosmic ionization and thermal histories with dark matter and other exotic energy injections EOS We present a new public Python package, DarkHistory, for computing the effects of dark matter annihilation and decay on the temperature and ionization history of the early universe. EOS DarkHistory simultaneously solves for the evolution of the free electron fraction and gas temperature, and for the cooling of annihilation/decay products and the secondary particles produced in the process. EOS Consequently, we can self-consistently include the effects of both astrophysical and exotic sources of heating and ionization, and automatically take into account backreaction, where modifications to the ionization/temperature history in turn modify the energy-loss processes for injected particles. EOS We present a number of worked examples, demonstrating how to use the code in a range of different configurations, in particular for arbitrary dark matter masses and annihilation/decay final states. EOS Possible applications of DarkHistory include mapping out the effects of dark matter annihilation/decay on the global 21cm signal and the epoch of reionization, as well as the effects of exotic energy injections other than dark matter annihilation/decay.	The code is available at https://github.com/hongwanliu/DarkHistory with documentation at https://darkhistory.readthedocs.io.
doc	Some open problems in the context of skew PBW extensions and semi-graded rings EOS In this paper we discuss some open problems of non-commutative algebra and non-commutative algebraic geometry from the approach of skew _EQN_ extensions and semi-graded rings. EOS More exactly, we will analyze the isomorphism arising in the investigation of the Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture about the commutation between the center and the total ring of fractions of an Ore domain. EOS The Serre's conjecture will be discussed for a particular class of skew _EQN_ extensions.	The questions about the noetherianity and the Zariski cancellation property of Artin-Schelter regular algebras will be reformulated for semi-graded rings.
doc	Optimal Decentralized Control with Asymmetric One-Step Delayed Information Sharing EOS We consider optimal control of decentralized LQG problems for plants controlled by two players having asymmetric information sharing patterns between them. EOS In one scenario, players are assumed to have a bidirectional error-free, unlimited rate communication channel with no delay in one direction and a unit delay in the other. EOS In another scenario, the communication channel is assumed to be unidirectional with a unit delay. EOS Delayed information sharing patterns in general do not admit linear optimal control laws and are thus difficult to control optimally. EOS However, in these scenarios, we show that the problem has a partially nested information structure, and thus linear optimal control laws exist.	Summary statistics to characterize these laws are developed and deterministic convex optimization problems are formulated whose solutions yield the optimal control laws.

doc	Open and Hidden Strangeness Production in Nucleon-Nucleon Collisions EOS We present an overview of the description of K and eta meson productions in nucleon-nucleon collisions within an effective Lagrangian model where meson production proceeds via excitation, propagation and subsequent decay of intermediate baryonic resonant states. EOS The _EQN_ meson contains a strange quark (_EQN_) or antiquark (_EQN_) while the _EQN_ meson has hidden strangeness as it contains some component of the _EQN_ pair.	Strange meson production is expected to provide information on the manifestation of quantum chromodynamics in the non-perturbative regime of energies larger than that of the low energy pion physics.

doc	Discovery of the Eclipsing Detached Double White Dwarf Binary NLTT 11748 EOS We report the discovery of the first eclipsing detached double white dwarf (WD) binary. EOS In a pulsation search, the low-mass helium core WD NLTT 11748 was targeted for fast (approx 1 minute) differential photometry with the Las Cumbres Observatory's Faulkes Telescope North. EOS Rather than pulsations, we discovered approx 180 s 3%-6% dips in the photometry. EOS Subsequent radial velocity measurements of the primary white dwarf from the Keck telescope found variations with a semi-amplitude K_1 = 271 +/- 3 km/s, and confirmed the dips as eclipses caused by an orbiting WD with a mass M_2 = 0.648-0.771 M_sun for M_1 = 0.1-0.2 M_sun. EOS We detect both the primary and secondary eclipses during the P_orb = 5.64 hr orbit and measure the secondary's brightness to be 3.5% +/- 0.3% of the primary at SDSS-g'. EOS Assuming that the secondary follows the mass-radius relation of a cold C/O WD and including the effects of microlensing in the binary, the primary eclipse yields a primary radius of R_1 = 0.043-0.039 R_sun for M_1 = 0.1-0.2 M_sun, consistent with the theoretically expected values for a helium core WD with a thick, stably burning hydrogen envelope.	Though nearby (at approx 150 pc), the gravitational wave strain from NLTT 11748 is likely not adequate for direct detection by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

EOS The ensued scientific debate, although exciting, is plagued with several misconceptions.	We will here provide a comprehensive treatment of the quantum dynamics of radical-ion-pair reactions, generalizing our recent work and elaborating on the analogy with the double-slit experiment having partial "which-path" information.

EOS We propose an explanation of these events in terms of a sterile neutrino decaying into a photon and a light neutrino.	The sterile neutrino has a mass around 250 MeV and it is produced from kaon decays in the proton beam target via mixing with the muon or the electron in the range _EQN_ (_EQN_).
doc	uvbyCa H beta CCD Photometry of Clusters. VII. The Intermediate-Age Anticenter Cluster Melotte 71 EOS CCD photometry on the intermediate-band uvbyCa H beta system is presented for the anticenter, intermediate-age open cluster, Melotte 71. EOS Restricting the data to probable single members of the cluster using the color-magnitude diagram and the photometric indices alone generates a sample of 48 F dwarfs on the unevolved main sequence. EOS The average E(b-y) = 0.148 +/- 0.003 (s.e.m.) or E(B-V) = 0.202 +/- 0.004 (s.e.m.), where the errors refer to internal errors alone. EOS With this reddening, [Fe/H] is derived from both m1 and hk, using H beta and b-y as the temperature index, with excellent agreement among the four approaches and a final weighted average of [Fe/H] = -0.17 +/- 0.02 (s.e.m.) for the cluster, on a scale where the Hyades has [Fe/H] = +0.12. EOS When adjusted for the higher reddening estimate, the previous metallicity estimates from Washington photometry and from spectroscopy are now in agreement with the intermediate-band result. EOS From comparisons to isochrones of appropriate metallicity, the cluster age and distance are determined as 0.9 +/- 0.1 Gyr and (m-M) = 12.2 +/- 0.1 or (m-M)_0 = 11.6 +/- 0.1.	At this distance from the sun, Mel 71 has a galactocentric distance of 10.0 kpc on a scale where the sun is 8.5 kpc from the galactic center.

doc	Subsurface Flows in and Around Active Regions with Rotating and Non-rotating Sunspots EOS The temporal variation of the horizontal velocity in subsurface layers beneath three different types of active regions is studied using the technique of ring diagrams. EOS In this study, we select active regions (ARs) 10923, 10930, 10935 from three consecutive Carrington rotations: AR 10930 contains a fast-rotating sunspot in a strong emerging active region while other two have non-rotating sunspots with emerging flux in AR 10923 and decaying flux in AR 10935. EOS The depth range covered is from the surface to about 12 Mm. EOS In order to minimize the influence of systematic effects, the selection of active and quiet regions is made so that these were observed at the same heliographic locations on the solar disk. EOS We find a significant variation in both components of the horizontal velocity in active regions as compared to quiet regions. EOS The magnitude is higher in emerging-flux regions than in the decaying-flux region, in agreement with earlier findings.	Further, we clearly see a significant temporal variation in depth profiles of both zonal and meridional flow components in AR 10930, with the variation in the zonal component being more pronounced.

doc	Computing the Expected Value and Variance of Geometric Measures EOS Let P be a set of points in R^d, and let M be a function that maps any subset of P to a positive real number. EOS We examine the problem of computing the exact mean and variance of M when a subset of points in P is selected according to a well-defined random distribution. EOS We consider two distributions; EOS in the first distribution (which we call the Bernoulli distribution), each point p in P is included in the random subset independently, with probability pi(p). EOS In the second distribution (the fixed-size distribution), a subset of exactly s points is selected uniformly at random among all possible subsets of s points in P. EOS This problem is a crucial part of modern ecological analyses; EOS each point in P represents a species in d-dimensional trait space, and the goal is to compute the statistics of a geometric measure on this trait space, when subsets of species are selected under random processes. EOS We present efficient exact algorithms for computing the mean and variance of several geometric measures when point sets are selected under one of the described random distributions. EOS More specifically, we provide algorithms for the following measures: the bounding box volume, the convex hull volume, the mean pairwise distance (MPD), the squared Euclidean distance from the centroid, and the diameter of the minimum enclosing disk.	We also describe an efficient (1-e)-approximation algorithm for computing the mean and variance of the mean pairwise distance.
doc	High-dimensional frequency-bin entangled photons in an optical microresonator on a chip EOS Quantum frequency combs from chip-scale integrated sources are promising candidates for scalable and robust quantum information processing (QIP). EOS However, to use these quantum combs for frequency domain QIP, demonstration of entanglement in the frequency basis, showing that the entangled photons are in a coherent superposition of multiple frequency bins, is required.	We present a verification of qubit and qutrit frequency-bin entanglement using an on-chip quantum frequency comb with 40 mode pairs, through a two-photon interference measurement that is based on electro-optic phase modulation.

doc	Bias-voltage induced phase-transition in bilayer quantum Hall ferromagnets EOS We consider bilayer quantum Hall systems at total filling factor _EQN_ in presence of a bias voltage _EQN_ which leads to different filling factors in each layer. EOS We use auxiliary field functional integral approach to study mean-field solutions and collective excitations around them. EOS We find that at large layer separation, the collective excitations soften at a finite wave vector leading to the collapse of quasiparticle gap.	Our calculations predict that as the bias voltage is increased, bilayer systems undergo a phase transition from a compressible state to a _EQN_ phase-coherent state with charge imbalance.
doc	Novel spin-liquid states in the frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice EOS Recent experiment on a honeycomb-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet (AF) Bi _EQN_ Mn _EQN_ O _EQN_ (NO _EQN_) revealed a novel spin-liquid-like behavior down to low temperature, which was ascribed to the frustration effect due to the competition between the AF nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS Motivated by the experiment, we study the ordering of the _EQN_ - _EQN_ frustrated classical Heisenberg AF on a honeycomb lattice both by a low-temperature expansion and a Monte Carlo simulation. EOS The model has been known to possess a massive degeneracy of the ground state, which, however, might be lifted due to thermal fluctuations leading to a unique ordered state, the effect known as 'order-by-disorder'. EOS We find that the model exhibits an intriguing ordering behavior, particularly near the AF phase boundary.	The energy scale of the order-by-disorder is suppressed there down to extremely low temperatures, giving rise to exotic spin-liquid states like a "ring-liquid" or a "pancake-liquid" state accompanied by the characteristic spin structure factor and the field-induced antiferromagnetism.

EOS Problems discussed include small angle Rutherford scattering, Jackson's recent `torque paradox' and circular Keplerian orbits.	Results consistent with special relativity are obtained only with an instantaneous interaction.
doc	Definably compact groups definable in real closed fields. I EOS We study definably compact definably connected groups definable in a sufficiently saturated real closed field _EQN_. EOS We introduce the notion of group-generic point for _EQN_ -definable groups and show the existence of group-generic points for definably compact groups definable in a sufficiently saturated o-minimal expansion of a real closed field.	We use this notion along with some properties of generic sets to prove that for every definably compact definably connected group _EQN_ definable in _EQN_ there are a connected _EQN_ -algebraic group _EQN_, a definable injective map _EQN_ from a generic definable neighborhood of the identity of _EQN_ into the group _EQN_ of _EQN_ -points of _EQN_ such that _EQN_ acts as a group homomorphism inside its domain.
doc	Learning Power Spectrum Maps from Quantized Power Measurements EOS Power spectral density (PSD) maps providing the distribution of RF power across space and frequency are constructed using power measurements collected by a network of low-cost sensors. EOS By introducing linear compression and quantization to a small number of bits, sensor measurements can be communicated to the fusion center with minimal bandwidth requirements. EOS Strengths of data- and model-driven approaches are combined to develop estimators capable of incorporating multiple forms of spectral and propagation prior information while fitting the rapid variations of shadow fading across space. EOS To this end, novel nonparametric and semiparametric formulations are investigated. EOS It is shown that PSD maps can be obtained using support vector machine-type solvers.	In addition to batch approaches, an online algorithm attuned to real-time operation is developed.

doc	Spin injection and pumping generated by a direct current flowing through a magnetic tunnel junction EOS A charge flow through a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) leads to the generation of a spin-polarized current which exerts a spin-transfer torque (STT) on the magnetization. EOS When the density of applied direct current exceeds some critical value, the STT excites high-frequency magnetization precession in the "free" electrode of MTJ. EOS Such precession gives rise to microwave output voltage and, furthermore, can be employed for spin pumping into adjacent normal metal or semiconductor. EOS Here we describe theoretically the spin dynamics and charge transport in the CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/Au tunneling heterostructure connected to a constant-current source. EOS The magnetization dynamics in the free CoFeB layer with weak perpendicular anisotropy is calculated by numerical integration of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation accounting for both STT and voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy associated with the CoFeB|MgO interface. EOS It is shown that a large-angle magnetization precession, resulting from electrically induced dynamic spin reorientation transition, can be generated in a certain range of relatively low current densities. EOS An oscillating spin current, which is pumped into the Au overlayer owing to such precession, is then evaluated together with the injected spin current. EOS Considering both the driving spin-polarized charge current and the pumped spin current, we also describe the charge transport in the CoFeB/Au bilayer with the account of anomalous and inverse spin Hall effects.	An electric potential difference between the lateral sides of the CoFeB/Au bilayer is calculated as a function of distance from the CoFeB|MgO interface.
doc	An intrinsic hyperboloid approach for Einstein Klein-Gordon equations EOS In  Klainerman introduced the hyperboloidal method to prove the global existence results for nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations by using commuting vector fields. EOS In this paper, we extend the hyperboloidal method from Minkowski space to Lorentzian spacetimes. EOS This approach is developed in  for proving, under the maximal foliation gauge, the global nonlinear stability of Minkowski space for Einstein equations with massive scalar fields, which states that, the sufficiently small data in a compact domain, surrounded by a Schwarzschild metric, leads to a unique, globally hyperbolic, smooth and geodesically complete solution to the Einstein Klein-Gordon system. EOS In this paper, we set up the geometric framework of the intrinsic hyperboloid approach in the curved spacetime.	By performing a thorough geometric comparison between the radial normal vector field induced by the intrinsic hyperboloids and the canonical _EQN_, we manage to control the hyperboloids when they are close to their asymptote, which is a light cone in the Schwarzschild zone.
doc	A Young Brown Dwarf Companion to DH Tauri EOS We present the detection of a young brown dwarf companion DH Tau B associated with the classical T Tauri star DH Tau. EOS Near-infrared coronagraphic observations with CIAO on the Subaru Telescope have revealed DH Tau B with H = \~15 mag located at 2.3" (330 AU) away from the primary DH Tau A. EOS Comparing its position with a Hubble Space Telescope archive image, we confirmed that DH Tau A and B share the common proper motion, suggesting that they are physically associated with each other. EOS The near-infrared color of DH Tau B is consistent with those of young stellar objects. EOS The near-infrared spectra of DH Tau B show deep water absorption bands, a strong K I absorption line, and a moderate Na I absorption line.	We derived its effective temperature and surface gravity of Teff = 2700 -- 2800 K and log g = 4.0--4.5, respectively, by comparing the observed spectra with synthesized spectra of low-mass objects.

doc	The Flare Activity of SgrA*; New Coordinated mm to X-Ray Observations EOS We report new simultaneous near-infrared/sub-millimeter/X-ray observations of the SgrA* counterpart associated with the massive 3-4x10**6 solar mass black hole at the Galactic Center. EOS The main aim is to investigate the physical processes responsible for the variable emission from SgrA*.	The observations have been carried out using the NACO adaptive optics (AO) instrument at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope and the ACIS-I instrument aboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory as well as the Submillimeter Array SMA on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and the Very Large Array in New Mexico.
doc	The Virasoro group and the fourth geometry of Poincar\'e	We investigate, in some details, symplectic equivalence between several conformal classes of Lorentz metrics on the hyperboloid of one sheet _EQN_ and affine coadjoint orbits of the group _EQN_ of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of _EQN_ with its natural projective structure.
doc	Light front QED, Stueckelberg field and Infrared divergence EOS Stueckelberg mechanism introduces a scalar field, known as Stueckelberg field, so that gauge symmetry is preserved in the massive abelian gauge theory. EOS In this work, we show that the role of the Stueckelberg field is similar to the Kulish and Faddeev coherent state approach to handle infrared (IR) divergences.	We expect that the light-front quantum electrodynamics (LFQED) with Stueckelberg field must be IR finite in the massless limit of the gauge boson.
doc	Infrared absorption and Raman scattering on coupled plasmon--phonon modes in superlattices EOS We consider theoretically a superlattice formed by thin conducting layers separated spatially between insulating layers. EOS The dispersion of two coupled phonon-plasmon modes of the system is analyzed by using Maxwell's equations, with the influence of retardation included. EOS Both transmission for the finite plate as well as absorption for the semi-infinite superlattice in the infrared are calculated.	Reflectance minima are determined by the longitudinal and transverse phonon frequencies in the insulating layers and by the density-state singularities of the coupled modes.
doc	Origin of the highest energy cosmic rays observed EOS Introducing a simple Galactic wind model patterned after the solar wind we show that back-tracing the orbits of the highest energy cosmic events suggests that they may all come from the Virgo cluster, and so probably from the active radio galaxy M87. EOS This confirms a long standing expectation.	Those powerful radio galaxies that have their relativistic jets stuck in the interstellar medium of the host galaxy, such as 3C147, will then enable us to derive limits on the production of any new kind of particle, expected in some extensions of the standard model in particle physics.

doc	Scalable Digital Hardware for a Trapped Ion Quantum Computer EOS Many of the challenges of scaling quantum computer hardware lie at the interface between the qubits and the classical control signals used to manipulate them. EOS Modular ion trap quantum computer architectures address scalability by constructing individual quantum processors interconnected via a network of quantum communication channels.	Successful operation of such quantum hardware requires a fully programmable classical control system capable of frequency stabilizing the continuous wave lasers necessary for trapping and cooling the ion qubits, stabilizing the optical frequency combs used to drive logic gate operations on the ion qubits, providing a large number of analog voltage sources to drive the trap electrodes, and a scheme for maintaining phase coherence among all the controllers that manipulate the qubits.
doc	Incipient Spanning Clusters in Square and Cubic Percolation EOS The analysis of extensive numerical data for the percolation probabilities of incipient spanning clusters in two dimensional percolation at criticality are presented. EOS We developed an effective code for the single-scan version of the Hoshen-Kopelman algorithm. EOS We measured the probabilities on the square lattice forming samples of rectangular strips with widths from 8 to 256 sites and lengths up to 3200 sites. EOS At total of more than _EQN_ random numbers are generated for the sampling procedure.	Our data confirm the proposed exact formulaes for the probability exponents conjectured recently on the base of 2D conformal field theory.
doc	Presentations of Schutzenberger groups of minimal subshifts EOS In previous work, the first author established a natural bijection between minimal subshifts and maximal regular J-classes of free profinite semigroups. EOS In this paper, the Sch\"utzenberger groups of such J-classes are investigated, in particular in respect to a conjecture proposed by the first author concerning their profinite presentation. EOS The conjecture is established for all non-periodic minimal subshifts associated with substitutions.	It entails that it is decidable whether a finite group is a quotient of such a profinite group.
doc	The properties of planets around giant stars EOS Context: More than 50 exoplanets have been found around giant stars, revealing different properties when compared to planets orbiting solar-type stars. EOS In particular, they are Super-Jupiters and are not found orbiting interior to _EQN_ 0.5 AU. EOS Aims: We are conducting a radial velocity study of a sample of 166 giant stars aimed at studying the population of close-in planets orbiting giant stars and how their orbital and physical properties are influenced by the post-MS evolution of the host star. EOS Methods: We have collected multi epochs spectra for all of the targets in our sample. EOS We have computed precision radial velocities from FECH/CHIRON and FEROS spectra, using the I _EQN_ cell technique and the simultaneous calibration method, respectively. EOS Results: We present the discovery of a massive planet around the giant star HIP105854. EOS The best Keplerian fit to the data leads to an orbital distance of 0.81 _EQN_ 0.03 AU, an eccentricity of 0.02 _EQN_ 0.03 and a projected mass of 8.2 _EQN_ 0.2 \mjup. EOS With the addition of this new planet discovery, we performed a detailed analysis of the orbital properties and mass distribution of the planets orbiting giant stars. EOS We show that there is an overabundance of planets around giant stars with _EQN_ 0.5-0.9 AU, which might be attributed to tidal decay.	Additionally, these planets are significantly more massive than those around MS and subgiant stars, suggesting that they grow via accretion either from the stellar wind or by mass transfer from the host star.
doc	Principal axes for stochastic dynamics EOS We introduce a general procedure for directly ascertaining how many independent stochastic sources exist in a complex system modeled through a set of coupled Langevin equations of arbitrary dimension. EOS The procedure is based on the computation of the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of local diffusion matrices. EOS We demonstrate our algorithm by applying it to two examples of systems showing Hopf-bifurcation.	We argue that computing the eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalues of the diffusion matrix at local mesh points in the phase space enables one to define vector fields of stochastic eigendirections.

doc	Tile HCAL Test Beam Analysis: Positron and Hadron Studies EOS The CALICE collaboration has constructed a hadronic sandwich calorimeter prototype with 7608 scintillating plates, individually read out by multi-pixel silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). EOS For the first time ever the read out is performed using SiPMs on a large scale.	Results of test beam operations with muon, positron and hadron beams at CERN are presented here, validating the feasibility of the novel SiPM technology.
doc	Magneto-transport in Disordered Graphene: from Weak Localization to Strong Localization EOS We present a magneto-transport study of graphene samples into which a mild disorder was introduced by exposure to ozone. EOS Unlike the conductivity of pristine graphene, the conductivity of graphene samples exposed to ozone becomes very sensitive to temperature: it decreases by more than 3 orders of magnitude between 100K and 1K. EOS By varying either an external gate voltage or temperature, we continuously tune the transport properties from the weak to the strong localization regime.	We show that the transition occurs as the phase coherence length becomes comparable to the localization length.
doc	Fast computation of high frequency Dirichlet eigenmodes via the spectral flow of the interior Neumann-to-Dirichlet map EOS We present a new algorithm for numerical computation of large eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet Laplacian in a smooth, star-shaped domain in _EQN_, _EQN_. EOS Conventional boundary-based methods require a root-search in eigenfrequency _EQN_, hence take _EQN_ effort per eigenpair found, using dense linear algebra, where _EQN_ is the number of unknowns required to discretize the boundary. EOS Our method is O(N) faster, achieved by linearizing with respect to _EQN_ the spectrum of a weighted interior Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) operator for the Helmholtz equation. EOS Approximations _EQN_ to the square-roots _EQN_ of all O(N) eigenvalues lying in _EQN_, where _EQN_, are found with _EQN_ effort. EOS We prove an error estimate _EQN_ with _EQN_ independent of _EQN_. EOS We present a higher-order variant with eigenvalue error scaling empirically as _EQN_ and eigenfunction error as _EQN_, the former improving upon the 'scaling method' of Vergini--Saraceno. EOS For planar domains (_EQN_), with an assumption of absence of spectral concentration, we also prove rigorous error bounds that are close to those numerically observed.	For _EQN_ we compute robustly the spectrum of the NtD operator via potential theory, Nystr\" o m discretization, and the Cayley transform.

doc	Accidental Inflation in the Landscape EOS We study some aspects of fine tuning in inflationary scenarios within string theory flux compactifications and, in particular, in models of accidental inflation. EOS We investigate the possibility that the apparent fine-tuning of the low energy parameters of the theory needed to have inflation can be generically obtained by scanning the values of the fluxes over the landscape. EOS Furthermore, we find that the existence of a landscape of eternal inflation in this model provides us with a natural theory of initial conditions for the inflationary period in our vacuum.	We demonstrate how these two effects work in a small corner of the landscape associated with the complex structure of the Calabi-Yau manifold P^4_[1,1,1,6,9] by numerically investigating the flux vacua of a reduced moduli space.
doc	The Kondo-Hubbard model at half-filling EOS We have analyzed the antiferromagnetic (J>0) Kondo-Hubbard lattice with the band at half-filling by means of a perturbative approach in the strong coupling limit, the small parameter is an arbitrary tight-binding band. EOS The results are valid for any band shape and any dimension.	We have obtained the energies of elementary charge and spin excitations as well as the magnetic correlations in order to elucidate the magnetic and charge behavior of the Kondo lattice at half-filling.

doc	Geometric Dynamics of Magnetization: Electronic Contribution EOS To give a general description of the influences of electric fields or currents on magnetization dynamics, we developed a semiclassical theory for the magnetization implicitly coupled to electronic degrees of freedom. EOS In the absence of electric fields the Bloch electron Hamiltonian changes the Berry curvature, the effective magnetic field, and the damping in the dynamical equation of the magnetization, which we classify into intrinsic and extrinsic effects. EOS Static electric fields modify these as first-order perturbations, using which we were able to give a physically clear interpretation of the current-induced spin-orbit torques.	We used a toy model mimicking a ferromagnet-topological-insulator interface to illustrate the various effects, and predicted an anisotropic gyromagnetic ratio and the dynamical stability for an in-plane magnetization.
doc	Finite Basis for Radical Well-Mixed Difference Ideals Generated by Binomials EOS In this paper, we prove a finite basis theorem for radical well-mixed difference ideals generated by binomials.	As a consequence, every strictly ascending chain of radical well-mixed difference ideals generated by binomials in a difference polynomial ring is finite, which answers a question raised by E.

doc	Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of holon-antiholon continuum in SrCuO2 EOS We report a resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of charge excitations in the quasi-one-dimensional Mott insulator SrCuO2. EOS We observe a continuum of low-energy excitations, in which a highly dispersive feature with a large sinusoidal dispersion (~1.1 eV) resides.	We have also measured the optical conductivity, and studied the dynamic response of the extended Hubbard model with realistic parameters, using a dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method.

We report on the scaling behaviour of the FP action on coarse lattices by means of the static quark-antiquark potential, the hadronic scale _EQN_, the string tension _EQN_ and the critical temperature _EQN_ of the deconfining phase transition.
doc	Searches for MSSM Higgs bosons at ATLAS and CMS EOS The Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) predicts the existence of three neutral and two charged Higgs bosons. EOS Searches for these MSSM Higgs bosons are presented, based on proton-proton collisions recorded in 2011 and 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC. EOS The neutral Higgs bosons are searched through their decays into pairs of oppositely charged tau leptons. EOS The exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are shown as a function of the _EQN_ and _EQN_ parameters. EOS The search for the charged Higgs bosons is based on their production through the decays of top quarks in the _EQN_ process, _EQN_.	The Higgs bosons subsequently decay predominantly into a tau lepton and a neutrino.
doc	Spin-orbit coupling and broken spin degeneracy in multilayer graphene EOS Since the lattices of ABA-stacked graphene multilayers with an even number of layers, as well as that of monolayer graphene, satisfy spatial-inversion symmetry, their electronic bands must be spin degenerate in the presence of time-inversion symmetry. EOS In intrinsic monolayer and bilayer graphene, when symmetry is not broken by external fields, the only spin-orbit coupling present at low energy near the corner of the Brillouin zone is the Kane-Mele term, that opens a bulk energy gap but does not break the spin degeneracy of the energy bands [C. EOS L. EOS Kane and E. EOS J. EOS Mele, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS 95, 226801 (2005)]. EOS However, spin splitting is allowed in multilayers with an odd number of layers (greater than or equal to 3) because their lattices do not satisfy spatial inversion symmetry. EOS We show that, in trilayer graphene, in addition to the Kane-Mele term, there is a second type of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling present at low energy near the corner of the Brillouin zone.	It introduces a Zeeman-like spin splitting of the energy bands at each valley, with an opposite sign of the effective magnetic field in the two valleys.
doc	Ultrafast Outflows from Black Hole Mergers with a Mini-Disk EOS Recently, the direct detection of gravitational waves from black hole (BH) mergers was announced by the Advanced LIGO Collaboration. EOS Multi-messenger counterparts of stellar-mass BH mergers are of interest, and it had been suggested that a small disk or celestial body may be involved in the binary of two BHs. EOS To test such possibilities, we consider the fate of a wind powered by an active mini-disk in a relatively short, super-Eddington accretion episode onto a BH with ~10-100 solar masses. EOS We show that its thermal emission could be seen as a fast optical transient with the duration from hours to days.	We also find that the coasting outflow forms external shocks due to interaction with the interstellar medium, whose synchrotron emission might be expected in the radio band on a time scale of years.
doc	Optical to UV spectra and birefringence of SiO _EQN_ and TiO _EQN_: First-principles calculations with excitonic effects EOS A first principles approach is presented for calculations of optical -- ultraviolet (UV) spectra including excitonic effects. EOS The approach is based on Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations using the \textsc NBSE code combined with ground-state density-functional theory calculations from the electronic structure code \textsc ABINIT.	Test calculations for bulk Si are presented, and the approach is illustrated with calculations of the optical spectra and birefringence of _EQN_ -phase SiO _EQN_ and the rutile and anatase phases of TiO _EQN_.

The model is extended to the nucleon to study the role of _EQN_ pair production and of nonvalence components in the nucleon form factors.
doc	Local Two-Photon Couplings and the J=0 Fixed Pole in Real and Virtual Compton Scattering EOS The local coupling of two photons to the fundamental quark currents of a hadron gives an energy-independent contribution to the Compton amplitude proportional to the charge squared of the struck quark, a contribution which has no analog in hadron scattering reactions. EOS We show that this local contribution has a real phase and is universal, giving the same contribution for real or virtual Compton scattering for any photon virtuality and skewness at fixed momentum transfer squared t. EOS The t-dependence of this J=0 fixed Regge pole is parameterized by a yet unmeasured even charge-conjugation form factor of the target nucleon.	The t=0 limit gives an important constraint on the dependence of the nucleon mass on the quark mass through the Weisberger relation.
doc	Semi-galois Categories III: Witt vectors by deformations of modular functions EOS Based on our previous work on an arithmetic analogue of Christol's theorem, this paper studies in more detail the structure of the lambda-ring _EQN_ of algebraic Witt vectors for number fields _EQN_. EOS First developing general results concerning _EQN_, we apply them to the case when _EQN_ is an imaginary quadratic field.	The main results include the ``modularity theorem'' for algebraic Witt vectors, which claims that certain deformation families _EQN_ of modular functions of finite level always define algebraic Witt vectors _EQN_ by their special values, and conversely, every algebraic Witt vector _EQN_ is realized in this way, that is, _EQN_ for some deformation family _EQN_.
doc	Which spectral distortions does _EQN_ CDM actually predict? EOS Ever refined cosmological measurements have established the _EQN_ CDM concordance model, with the key cosmological parameters being determined to percent-level precision today. EOS This allows us to make explicit predictions for the spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) created by various processes occurring in the early Universe. EOS Here, we summarize all guaranteed CMB distortions and assess their total uncertainty within _EQN_ CDM. EOS We also compare simple methods for approximating them, highlighting some of the subtle aspects when it comes to interpreting future distortion measurements. EOS Under simplified assumptions, we briefly study how well a PIXIE-like experiment may measure the main distortion parameters (i.e., _EQN_ and _EQN_). EOS Next generation CMB spectrometers are expected to detect the distortion caused by reionization and structure formation at extremely high significance. EOS They will also be able to constrain the small-scale power spectrum through the associated _EQN_ -distortion, improving limits on running of the spectral index.	Distortions from the recombination era, adiabatic cooling of matter relative to the CMB and dark matter annihilation require a higher sensitivity than PIXIE in its current design.
doc	Classifying Finite Dimensional Cubulations of Tubular Groups EOS A tubular group is a group that acts on a tree with _EQN_ vertex stabilizers and _EQN_ edge stabilizers. EOS This paper develops further a criterion of Wise and determines when a tubular group acts freely on a finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex.	As a consequence we offer a unified explanation of the failure of separability by revisiting the non-separable 3-manifold group of Burns, Karrass and Solitar and relating it to the work of Rubinstein and Wang.
doc	Adiabatic Selfconsistent Collective Coordinate Method for Large Amplitude Collective Motion in Superconducting Nuclei EOS An adiabatic approximation to the selfconsistent collective coordinate method is formulated in order to describe large amplitude collective motions in superconducting nuclei on the basis of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations of motion. EOS The basic equations are presented in a local harmonic form which can be solved in a similar way as the quasiparticle RPA equations.	The formalism guarantees the conservation of nucleon number expectation values.
doc	First detection of a gravitational microlensing candidate towards the Small Magellanic Cloud EOS We report the first discovery of a gravitational microlensing candidate towards a new population of source stars, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). EOS The candidate event's light curve shows no variation for 3 years before an upward excursion lasting _EQN_ days that peaks around January 11, 1997 at a magnification of _EQN_.	Microlensing events towards the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Galactic bulge have allowed important conclusions to be reached on the stellar and dark matter content of the Milky Way.
doc	Short-lived Nuclei in the Early Solar System: Possible AGB Sources EOS (Abridged) We review abundances of short-lived nuclides in the early solar system (ESS) and the methods used to determine them. EOS We compare them to the inventory for a uniform galactic production model. EOS Within a factor of two, observed abundances of several isotopes are compatible with this model. EOS I-129 is an exception, with an ESS inventory much lower than expected. EOS The isotopes Pd-107, Fe-60, Ca-41, Cl-36, Al-26, and Be-10 require late addition to the solar nebula. EOS Be-10 is the product of particle irradiation of the solar system as probably is Cl-36. EOS Late injection by a supernova (SN) cannot be responsible for most short-lived nuclei without excessively producing Mn-53; EOS it can be the source of Mn-53 and maybe Fe-60. EOS If a late SN is responsible for these two nuclei, it still cannot make Pd-107 and other isotopes. EOS We emphasize an AGB star as a source of nuclei, including Fe-60 and explore this possibility with new stellar models. EOS A dilution factor of about 4e-3 gives reasonable amounts of many nuclei. EOS We discuss the role of irradiation for Al-26, Cl-36 and Ca-41. EOS Conflict between scenarios is emphasized as well as the absence of a global interpretation for the existing data. EOS Abundances of actinides indicate a quiescent interval of about 1e8 years for actinide group production in order to explain the data on Pu-244 and new bounds on Cm-247.	This interval is not compatible with Hf-182 data, so a separate type of r-process is needed for at least the actinides, distinct from the two types previously identified.
doc	SINR Analysis of Different Multicarrier Waveforms over Doubly Dispersive Channels EOS Wireless channels generally exhibit dispersion in both time and frequency domain, known as doubly selective or doubly dispersive channels. EOS To combat the delay spread effect, multicarrier modulation (MCM) such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and its universal filtered variant (UF-OFDM) is employed, leading to the simple per-subcarrier one tap equalization. EOS The time-varying nature of the channel, in particular, the intra-multicarrier-symbol channel variation induces spectral broadening and thus inter-carrier interference (ICI). EOS Existing works address both effects separately, focus on the one effect while ignoring the respective other. EOS This paper considers both effect simultaneously for cyclic prefix (CP)-, zero padded (ZP)- and UF-based OFDM with simple one tap equalization, assuming a general wireless channel model. EOS For this general channel model, we show that the independent (wide sense stationary uncorrelated scatter, WSSUS) selectivity in time and frequency starts to intertwine in contrast to the ideal cases with single selectivity.	We derive signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in closed form for arbitrary system settings and channel parameters, e.g., bandwidth, delay- and Doppler-spread.
doc	Sampling and scrambling on a chain of superconducting qubits EOS We study a circuit, the Josephson sampler, that embeds a real vector into an entangled state of n qubits, and optionally samples from it. EOS We measure its fidelity and entanglement on the 16-qubit ibmqx5 chip.	To assess its expressiveness, we also measure its ability to generate Haar random unitaries and quantum chaos, as measured by Porter-Thomas statistics and out-of-time-order correlation functions.
doc	Warping the Universal Extra Dimensions EOS We develop the necessary ingredients for the construction of realistic models with warped universal extra dimensions. EOS Our investigations are based on the seven dimensional (7D) spacetime AdS_5 x T^2 and we derive the Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectra for gravitons, bulk vectors and the TeV brane localized Higgs boson. EOS We show that, starting with a massive 7D fermion, one may obtain a single chiral massless mode whose profile is readily localized towards the Planck or TeV brane. EOS This allows one to place the standard model fermions in the bulk and construct models of flavor as in Randall-Sundrum models.	Our solution also admits the familiar KK parity of UED models so that the lightest odd KK state is stable and may be a dark matter (DM) candidate.
doc	Supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the lattice: III. Simulations and algorithms EOS In the fermion loop formulation the contributions to the partition function naturally separate into topological equivalence classes with a definite sign. EOS This separation forms the basis for an efficient fermion simulation algorithm using a fluctuating open fermion string. EOS It guarantees sufficient tunnelling between the topological sectors, and hence provides a solution to the fermion sign problem affecting systems with broken supersymmetry.	Moreover, the algorithm shows no critical slowing down even in the massless limit and can hence handle the massless Goldstino mode emerging in the supersymmetry broken phase.

In knot physics, the most important physical result is the unification of everything (including matter, motion, interaction and space-time,...) into the entangled vortex-membranes (a knot): our universe is a projection of a four three dimensional entangled vortex-membranes in five dimensional inviscid incompressible fluid, of which the low energy effective theory not only reproduces the Standard model -- an SU_ strong (3) *SU_ weak (2)*U_ Y (1) gauge theory but also leads to the physics of general relativity.

doc	The Ratio of Helium- to Hydrogen-Atmosphere White Dwarfs: Direct Evidence for Convective Mixing EOS We determine the ratio of helium- to hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarf stars as a function of effective temperature from a model atmosphere analysis of the infrared photometric data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey combined with available visual magnitudes. EOS Our study surpasses any previous analysis of this kind both in terms of the accuracy of the Teff determinations as well as the size of the sample.	We observe that the ratio of helium- to hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs increases gradually from a constant value of ~0.25 between Teff = 15,000 K and 10,000 K to a value twice as large in the range 10,000 > Teff > 8000 K, suggesting that convective mixing, which occurs when the bottom of the hydrogen convection zone reaches the underlying convective helium envelope, is responsible for this gradual transition.
doc	Beta decays as sensitive probes of lepton flavor universality EOS Nuclear _EQN_ decays as well as the decay of the neutron are well-established low-energy probes of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). EOS In particular, with the axial-vector coupling of the nucleon _EQN_ determined from lattice QCD, the comparison between experiment and SM prediction is commonly used to derive constraints on right-handed currents. EOS Further, in addition to the CKM element _EQN_ from kaon decays, _EQN_ from _EQN_ decays is a critical input for the test of CKM unitarity. EOS Here, we point out that the available information on _EQN_ decays can be re-interpreted as a stringent test of lepton flavor universality (LFU). EOS In fact, we find that the ratio of _EQN_ from kaon decays over _EQN_ from _EQN_ decays (assuming CKM unitarity) is extremely sensitive to LFU violation (LFUV) in _EQN_ - _EQN_ - _EQN_ couplings thanks to a CKM enhancement by _EQN_.	From this perspective, recent hints for the violation of CKM unitarity can be viewed as further evidence for LFUV, fitting into the existing picture exhibited by semi-leptonic _EQN_ decays and the anomalous magnetic moments of muon and electron.

doc	Star cluster ecology III: Runaway collisions in young compact star clusters EOS The evolution of young compact star clusters is studied using N-body simulations in which both stellar evolution and physical collisions between stars are taken into account. EOS The initial conditions are chosen to represent R136, a compact star cluster in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic Cloud. EOS The present runs do not include the effects of primordial binaries. EOS We find that physical collisions between stars in these models are frequent, and that the evolution of the most massive stars and the dynamical evolution of the cluster are closely coupled. EOS In all cases, a single star grows steadily in mass through mergers with other stars, forming a very massive (>100 Msun) star in less than 3-4 Myr. EOS The growth rate of this runaway merger is much larger than estimates based on simple cross-section arguments, mainly because the star is typically found in the core and tends to form binaries with other massive stars there. EOS The runaway is ``rejuvenated'' by each new collision, and its lifetime is extended considerably as a consequence.	Observationally, such a star will appear in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram as a blue straggler.
doc	Explaining the _EQN_ and _EQN_ Anomalies With Right-handed Sneutrino EOS The recent intriguing measurements of _EQN_ and _EQN_ are important hints of new physics that violates lepton universality. EOS We analyze the semileptonic decays _EQN_ in the framework of the _EQN_ extension of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with Inverse Seesaw (BLSSMIS). EOS A salient feature of this model is that one of the right-handed sneutrino can be light and the neutrino Yukawa couplings are of order one.	We show that the box diagram mediated by right-handed sneutrino, higgsino-like chargino, and light stop can account simultaneously for both _EQN_ and _EQN_.

doc	Breakup of the Fermi surface near the Mott transition in low-dimensional systems EOS We investigate the Mott transition in weakly-coupled one-dimensional (1d) fermionic chains. EOS Using a generalization of Dynamic Mean Field Theory, we show that the Mott gap is suppressed at some critical hopping _EQN_. EOS The transition from the 1d insulator to a 2d metal proceeds through an intermediate phase where the Fermi surface is broken into electron and hole pockets.	The quasiparticle spectral weight is strongly anisotropic along the Fermi surface, both in the intermediate and metallic phases.
doc	Minimal Dark Matter and Leptogenesis EOS A Dirac fermion carrying an integral weak isospin and the vanishing hypercharge is considered as its neutral component can be a promising dark matter candidate (called the minimal dark matter) whose mass is of order 100 GeV. EOS While the symmetric population annihilates away due to a rapid gauge interaction, its asymmetric abundance is supposed to be produced by the decay of a right-handed neutrino superfield in the supersymmetric type I seesaw mechanism.	The efficiencies for generating the dark matter and lepton asymmetries are calculated by solving a set of approximate Boltzmann equations.
doc	Boson stars in massive dilatonic gravity EOS We study equilibrium configurations of boson stars in the framework of a class scalar-tensor theories of gravity with massive gravitational scalar (dilaton). EOS In particular we investigate the influence of the mass of the dilaton on the boson star structure.	We find that the masses of the boson stars in presence of dilaton are close to those in general relativity and they are sensitive to the ratio of the boson mass to the dilaton mass within a typical few percent.
doc	Encoding dynamics for multiscale community detection: Markov time sweeping for the Map equation EOS The detection of community structure in networks is intimately related to finding a concise description of the network in terms of its modules. EOS This notion has been recently exploited by the Map equation formalism (M. EOS Rosvall and C.T. EOS Bergstrom, PNAS, 105(4), pp.1118--1123, 2008) through an information-theoretic description of the process of coding inter- and intra-community transitions of a random walker in the network at stationarity. EOS However, a thorough study of the relationship between the full Markov dynamics and the coding mechanism is still lacking. EOS We show here that the original Map coding scheme, which is both block-averaged and one-step, neglects the internal structure of the communities and introduces an upper scale, the `field-of-view' limit, in the communities it can detect. EOS As a consequence, Map is well tuned to detect clique-like communities but can lead to undesirable overpartitioning when communities are far from clique-like. EOS We show that a signature of this behavior is a large compression gap: the Map description length is far from its ideal limit.	To address this issue, we propose a simple dynamic approach that introduces time explicitly into the Map coding through the analysis of the weighted adjacency matrix of the time-dependent multistep transition matrix of the Markov process.
doc	Asymmetric Totally-corrective Boosting for Real-time Object Detection EOS Real-time object detection is one of the core problems in computer vision. EOS The cascade boosting framework proposed by Viola and Jones has become the standard for this problem. EOS In this framework, the learning goal for each node is asymmetric, which is required to achieve a high detection rate and a moderate false positive rate. EOS We develop new boosting algorithms to address this asymmetric learning problem. EOS We show that our methods explicitly optimize asymmetric loss objectives in a totally corrective fashion. EOS The methods are totally corrective in the sense that the coefficients of all selected weak classifiers are updated at each iteration. EOS In contract, conventional boosting like AdaBoost is stage-wise in that only the current weak classifier's coefficient is updated.	At the heart of the totally corrective boosting is the column generation technique.
doc	Precise predictions for the Higgs production in association with a W-boson pair at ILC EOS The Higgs-boson production in association with a W-boson pair at _EQN_ linear colliders is one of the important processes in probing the coupling between Higgs-boson and vector gauge bosons and discovering the signature of new physics. EOS We describe the impact of the complete electroweak(EW) radiative corrections of _EQN_ to this process in the standard model(SM) at the International Linear Collider(ILC), and investigate the dependence of the lowest-order(LO) and EW next-to-leading order(NLO) corrected cross sections on colliding energy _EQN_ and Higg-boson mass.	The LO and NLO EW corrected distributions of the invariant mass of W-boson pair and the transverse momenta of final _EQN_ - and Higgs-boson are presented.
doc	The best constant for centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality EOS We find the exact value of the best possible constant _EQN_ for the weak type _EQN_ inequality for the one dimensional centered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator.	We prove that _EQN_ is the largest root of the quadratic equation _EQN_ thus obtaining _EQN_.
doc	Improved Approximation of Linear Threshold Functions EOS We prove two main results on how arbitrary linear threshold functions _EQN_ over the _EQN_ -dimensional Boolean hypercube can be approximated by simple threshold functions. EOS Our first result shows that every _EQN_ -variable threshold function _EQN_ is _EQN_ -close to a threshold function depending only on _EQN_ many variables, where _EQN_ denotes the total influence or average sensitivity of _EQN_ This is an exponential sharpening of Friedgut's well-known theorem REF, which states that every Boolean function _EQN_ is _EQN_ -close to a function depending only on _EQN_ many variables, for the case of threshold functions. EOS We complement this upper bound by showing that _EQN_ many variables are required for _EQN_ -approximating threshold functions. EOS Our second result is a proof that every _EQN_ -variable threshold function is _EQN_ -close to a threshold function with integer weights at most _EQN_ This is a significant improvement, in the dependence on the error parameter _EQN_, on an earlier result of REF which gave a _EQN_ bound.	Our improvement is obtained via a new proof technique that uses strong anti-concentration bounds from probability theory.
doc	Statistical Gravitational Waveform Models: What to Simulate Next? EOS Models of gravitational waveforms play a critical role in detecting and characterizing the gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences. EOS Waveforms from numerical relativity (NR), while highly accurate, are too computationally expensive to produce to be directly used with Bayesian parameter estimation tools like Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo and nested sampling. EOS We propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR) method to generate accurate reduced-order-model waveforms based only on existing accurate (e.g. EOS NR) simulations. EOS Using a training set of simulated waveforms, our GPR approach produces interpolated waveforms along with uncertainties across the parameter space. EOS As a proof of concept, we use a training set of IMRPhenomD waveforms to build a GPR model in the 2-d parameter space of mass ratio _EQN_ and equal-and-aligned spin _EQN_. EOS Using a regular, equally-spaced grid of 120 IMRPhenomD training waveforms in _EQN_ and _EQN_, the GPR mean approximates IMRPhenomD in this space to mismatches below _EQN_. EOS Our approach can alternatively use training waveforms directly from numerical relativity.	Beyond interpolation of waveforms, we also present a greedy algorithm that utilizes the errors provided by our GPR model to optimize the placement of future simulations.

doc	Duality Walls, Duality Trees and Fractional Branes EOS We compute the NSVZ beta functions for N = 1 four-dimensional quiver theories arising from D-brane probes on singularities, complete with anomalous dimensions, for a large set of phases in the corresponding duality tree. EOS While these beta functions are zero for D-brane probes, they are non-zero in the presence of fractional branes. EOS As a result there is a non-trivial RG behavior. EOS We apply this running of gauge couplings to some toric singularities such as the cones over Hirzebruch and del Pezzo surfaces.	We observe the emergence in string theory, of ``Duality Walls,'' a finite energy scale at which the number of degrees of freedom becomes infinite, and beyond which Seiberg duality does not proceed.
doc	Algebraic deformations arising from orbifolds with discrete torsion EOS We develop methods for computing Hochschild cohomology groups and deformations of crossed product rings.	We use these methods to find deformations of a ring associated to a particular orbifold with discrete torsion, and give a presentation of the center of the resulting deformed ring.
doc	Skew-gentle algebras and orbifolds: Oberwolfach talk, January 2020 EOS This is an extended abstract of my talk at the Oberwolfach-Workshop "Representation Theory of Finite-Dimensional Algebras" (19-24 January 2020).	It introduces a geometric orbifold model for the bounded derived category of a skew-gentle algebra.
doc	Force balance and membrane shedding at the Red Blood Cell surface EOS During the aging of the red-blood cell, or under conditions of extreme echinocytosis, membrane is shed from the cell plasma membrane in the form of nano-vesicles.	We propose that this process is the result of the self-adaptation of the membrane surface area to the elastic stress imposed by the spectrin cytoskeleton, via the local buckling of membrane under increasing cytoskeleton stiffness.
doc	A Model for the Optical/IR Emission from Magnetars EOS A number of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) have recently been detected in the optical/IR wavelengths. EOS We use their inferred brightness to place general constraints on any model for this emission within the magnetar framework. EOS We find that neutron-star surface emission cannot account for the observations and that the emission must be magnetospheric in origin.	We propose a model for the optical/IR emission in which a distribution of energetic electrons in the neutron-star magnetosphere emits synchrotron radiation.
doc	Factorial Representations of Compact Lie Groups, Wigner Sets and Locally Invariant Quantum Fields EOS The fibre bundle construct defined in our previous work continues to be the context for this paper; EOS quantum fields composed of fibre algebras become liftings of; EOS or sections through; EOS a fibre bundle with base space a subset of curved space-time. EOS We consider a compact Lie group such as SU(n) acting as a local gauge group of automorphisms of each fibre algebra A(x). EOS Compact Lie groups, represented as gauge groups acting locally on quantum fields, are key elements in electroweak and strong force unification. EOS In our recent joint work we have focused on the translational subgroup of the Poincare group as the generator of local diffeomorphism invariant quantum states. EOS Here we extend those algebraic non-perturbative approaches to address the other half of unification by considering the existence of quantum states of the fibre algebra A(x) invariant to the action of compact non-abelian Lie groups. EOS Wigner sets are complementary to little groups and we prove they have the finite intersection property.	Exploiting this then allows us to show that invariant states are common in the sense that the weakly closed convex hull of every normal (density matrix) state contains such an invariant state.
doc	Quantum Critiality and Collective Effects in Low Dimensional Magnet CuGeO3 Probed by High Frequency EPR EOS For the CuGeO3 single crystals doped with 1% of Fe the quantum critical behavior in a wide temperature range 1-40 K is reported. EOS The critical exponents for susceptibility along different crystallographic axes are determined: a=0.34 (B //a and B //c) and a=0.31 (B //b).	The description of the temperature dependences of the line width and g-factor could be obtained in the OA theory assuming that staggered component of the magnetic moment is located predominantly along b axis.

doc	On regular groups and fields EOS Regular groups and fields are common generalizations of minimal and quasi-minimal groups and fields, so the conjectures that minimal or quasi-minimal fields are algebraically closed have their common generalization to the conjecture that each regular field is algebraically closed. EOS Standard arguments show that a generically stable regular field is algebraically closed. EOS Let _EQN_ be a regular field which is not generically stable and let _EQN_ be its global generic type. EOS We observe that if _EQN_ has a finite extension _EQN_ of degree _EQN_, then _EQN_ has unbounded orbit under the action of the multiplicative group of _EQN_. EOS Known to be true in the minimal context, it remains wide open whether regular, or even quasi-minimal, groups are abelian.	We show that if it is not the case, then there is a counter-example with a unique non-trivial conjugacy class, and we notice that a classical group with one non-trivial conjugacy class is not quasi-minimal, because the centralizers of all elements are uncountable.
doc	Quantum simulation of the Anderson Hamiltonian with an array of coupled nanoresonators: delocalization and thermalization effects EOS The possibility of using nanoelectromechanical systems as a simulation tool for quantum many-body effects is explored. EOS It is demonstrated that an array of electrostatically coupled nanoresonators can effectively simulate the Bose-Hubbard model without interactions, corresponding in the single-phonon regime to the Anderson tight-binding model. EOS Employing a density matrix formalism for the system coupled to a bosonic thermal bath, we study the interplay between disorder and thermalization, focusing on the delocalization process. EOS It is found that the phonon population remains localized for a long time at low enough temperatures; EOS with increasing temperatures the localization is rapidly lost due to thermal pumping of excitations into the array, producing in the equilibrium a fully thermalized system.	Finally, we consider a possible experimental design to measure the phonon population in the array by means of a superconducting transmon qubit coupled to individual nanoresonators.
doc	Perturbative renormalization of lattice N=4 super Yang-Mills theory EOS We consider N=4 super Yang-Mills theory on a four-dimensional lattice. EOS The lattice formulation under consideration retains one exact supersymmetry at non-zero lattice spacing. EOS We show that this feature combined with gauge invariance and the large point group symmetry of the lattice theory ensures that the only counterterms that appear at any order in perturbation theory correspond to renormalizations of existing terms in the bare lattice action. EOS In particular we find that no mass terms are generated at any finite order of perturbation theory.	We calculate these renormalizations by examining the fermion and auxiliary boson self energies at one loop and find that they all exhibit a common logarithmic divergence which can be absorbed by a single wavefunction renormalization.
doc	Higgs-Inflaton Symbiosis, Cosmological Constant Problem and Superacceleration Phase of the Universe in Two Measures Field Theory with Spontaneously Broken Scale Invariance EOS We study the scalar sector of the Two Measures Field Theory (TMT) model in the context of cosmological dynamics. EOS The scalar sector includes the inflaton \phi and the Higgs \upsilon fields. EOS The model possesses gauge and scale invariance. EOS The latter is spontaneously broken due to intrinsic features of the TMT dynamics. EOS In the model with the inflaton \phi alone, in different regions of the parameter space the following different effects can take place without fine tuning of the parameters and initial conditions: a) Possibility of resolution of the old cosmological constant problem: this is done in a consistent way hinted by S. EOS Weinberg in his comment concerning the question of how one can avoid his no-go theorem. EOS b) The power law inflation without any fine tuning may end with damped oscillations of _EQN_ around the state with zero cosmological constant. EOS c) There are regions of the parameters where the equation-of-state w=p/\rho in the late time universe is w<-1 and w asymptotically (as t\to\infty) approaches -1 from below. EOS This effect is achieved without any exotic term in the action. EOS In a model with both \phi and \upsilon fields, a scenario which resembles the hybrid inflation is realized but there are essential differences, for example: the Higgs field undergos transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase <\upsilon>\neq 0 soon after the end of a power law inflation;	there are two oscillatory regimes of \upsilon, one around \upsilon =0 at 50 e-folding before the end of inflation, another - during transition to a gauge symmetry broken phase where the scalar dark energy density approaches zero without fine tuning;

doc	Bias in parametric estimation: reduction and useful side-effects EOS The bias of an estimator is defined as the difference of its expected value from the parameter to be estimated, where the expectation is with respect to the model. EOS Loosely speaking, small bias reflects the desire that if an experiment is repeated indefinitely then the average of all the resultant estimates will be close to the parameter value that is estimated. EOS The current paper is a review of the still-expanding repository of methods that have been developed to reduce bias in the estimation of parametric models. EOS The review provides a unifying framework where all those methods are seen as attempts to approximate the solution of a simple estimating equation.	Of particular focus is the maximum likelihood estimator, which despite being asymptotically unbiased under the usual regularity conditions, has finite-sample bias that can result in significant loss of performance of standard inferential procedures.
doc	Decentralization as Organizing Principle of Emergent Urban Structures EOS With a view to the ongoing Bologna project (www.arXiv.org/pdf/nlin.AO/0109025) general organizing principles of emergent structures in social systems are being discussed with a view to the meaning of decentralization. EOS It is proposed to introduce decentralization as a principle for organizing emergent structures in a generic way utilizing aspects of the insight gained by the Santa Fe school dealing with self-organized criticality.	The techniques utilized come from graph theory, category theory, and in particular quantum gravity, which bear a strong potential for a multitude of applications in research fields with a significant interdisciplinary scope.

EOS The corpus is part of an on-going research and currently consists of 29,682 sentences obtained from anonymised health records annotated with negation and uncertainty. EOS The article includes an exhaustive comparison with similar corpora in Spanish, and presents the main annotation and design decisions.	Additionally, we perform preliminary experiments using deep learning algorithms to validate the annotated dataset.
doc	Twist-2 Generalized TMDs and the Spin/Orbital Structure of the Nucleon EOS Generalized transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions (GTMDs) encode the most general parton structure of hadrons. EOS Here we focus on two twist-2 GTMDs which are denoted by _EQN_ and _EQN_ in parts of the literature. EOS As already shown previously, both GTMDs have a close relation to orbital angular momentum of partons inside a hadron. EOS However, recently even the mere existence of _EQN_ and _EQN_ has been doubted. EOS We explain why this claim does not hold.	We support our model-independent considerations by calculating the two GTMDs in the scalar diquark model and in the quark-target model, where we also explicitly check the relation to orbital angular momentum.

Selection criteria for CCQE interactions will be presented, as will a strategy for calculating cross-section difference between plastic scintillator and water.

doc	Thermodynamic Properties of Static and Rotating Unparticle Black Holes EOS In this paper we find analytical expressions for thermodynamic quantities of scalar (tensor) and vector unparticle static black holes. EOS We also find rotating solutions to these systems and analyse their thermodynamics. EOS First we consider the static case with a spherically symmetric source for both the vector and scalar (tensor) unparticles. EOS We obtain thus analytical expressions to the principal thermodynamic quantities: Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity and free energy. EOS For the scalar (tensor) case we find that the black hole presents a residual value for the entropy when its radius goes to zero but the other thermodynamic quantities give, for any horizon radius, a thermodynamically unstable behavior similar to the standard black hole. EOS For the vector case we find a richer structure in the region in which the horizon radius is less than the characteristic length of the unparticle theory. EOS We identify a phase transition and a region where the black hole can be thermodynamically stable. EOS Following, we show that the mentioned modifications in the standard gravity are formally similar to those ones present in the black holes with quintessence. EOS With this we also show, notwithstanding, that the unparticles cannot be a source of quintessence. EOS By using this similarity we find two different rotating solutions to the unparticle black holes based on works by Ghosh and Toshmatov et al. EOS For both cases we compute the Hawking temperature and in the ungravity dominated regime we find, as in the static cases, a fractalization of the event horizon.	For the Gosh-like solution the fractal dimension depends on the polar angle and on the rotation of the source.
doc	Constraints on New Neutrino Interactions via Light Abelian Vector Bosons EOS We calculate new constraints on extra neutrino interactions via light Abelian vector bosons, where the boson mass arises from Stuckelberg mechanism. EOS We use the requirement that _EQN_, _EQN_, and kaon decays, as well as electron-neutrino scattering, are not altered by the new interactions beyond what is allowed by experimental uncertainties.	These constraints are strong and apply to neutrinophilic dark matter, where interactions of neutrinos and dark matter via a new gauge boson are important.
doc	T-Duality for Coset Models EOS We construct dual Lagrangians for _EQN_ models in two space-time dimensions for arbitrary Lie groups _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS Our approach does not require choosing coordinates on _EQN_, and allows for a natural generalization to Lie-Poisson duality. EOS For the case where the target metric on _EQN_ is induced from the invariant metric on _EQN_, the dual system is a gauged Higgs model, with a nonconstant metric and a coupling to an antisymmetric tensor. EOS The dynamics for the gauge connection is governed by a _EQN_ -term. EOS Lie-Poisson duality is relevant once we allow for a more general class of target metrics, as well as for couplings to an antisymmetric tensor, in the primary theory. EOS Then the dual theory is written on a group _EQN_ dual to _EQN_, and the gauge group _EQN_ (which, in general, is not a subgroup of _EQN_) acts nonlinearly on _EQN_.	The dual system therefore gives a nonlinear realization of a gauge theory.
doc	On the velocity of the Vela pulsar	It is shown that if the shell of the Vela supernova remnant is responsible for nearly all the scattering of the Vela pulsar, then the scintillation and proper motion velocities of the pulsar can only be reconciled with each other in the case of nonzero transverse velocity of the scattering material.
doc	An Adaptive Random Bit Multilevel Algorithm for SDEs EOS We study the approximation of expectations _EQN_ for solutions _EQN_ of stochastic differential equations and functionals _EQN_ on the path space by means of Monte Carlo algorithms that only use random bits instead of random numbers.	We construct an adaptive random bit multilevel algorithm, which is based on the Euler scheme, the L\'evy-Ciesielski representation of the Brownian motion, and asymptotically optimal random bit approximations of the standard normal distribution.

doc	Nonlocal Gravitomagnetism EOS We briefly review the current status of nonlocal gravity (NLG), which is a classical nonlocal generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation based on a certain analogy with the nonlocal electrodynamics of media. EOS Nonlocal gravity thus involves integro-differential field equations and a causal constitutive kernel that should ultimately be determined from observational data. EOS We consider the stationary gravitational field of an isolated rotating astronomical source in the linear approximation of nonlocal gravity.	In this weak-field and slow-motion approximation of NLG, we describe the gravitomagnetic field associated with the rotating source and compare our results with gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) of the standard general relativity theory.
doc	Abelian-Higgs cosmic string evolution with multiple GPUs EOS Topological defects form at cosmological phase transitions by the Kibble mechanism. EOS Cosmic strings and superstrings can lead to particularly interesting astrophysical and cosmological consequences, but this study is is currently limited by the availability of accurate numerical simulations, which in turn is bottlenecked by hardware resources and computation time. EOS Aiming to eliminate this bottleneck, in recent work we introduced and validated a GPU-accelerated evolution code for local Abelian-Higgs strings networks. EOS While this leads to significant gains in speed, it is still limited by physical memory available on a graphical accelerator.	Here we report on a further towards our main goal, by implementing and validating a multiple GPU extension of the earlier code, and further demonstrate its good scalability, both in terms of strong and weak scaling.

doc	Characteristic predictions of topological soliton models EOS The characteristic predictions of chiral soliton models - the Skyrme model and its extentions - are discussed. EOS The chiral soliton models prediction of dibaryon states with masses below NN-pion threshold is in qualitative agreement with recent evidence for the existence of narrow dibaryons in reactions of inelastic proton scattering on deuterons and two-photon radiation in proton-proton scattering. EOS The connection between isovector magnetic momentum operator and mixed tensor of inertia of multiskyrmion, as well as between isoscalar magnetic momentum and orbital tensor of inertia valid for skyrmions with any B-numbers allows to estimate the electromagnetic decay widths of some states of interest. EOS Another kind of predictions are multibaryons with nontrivial flavour - strangeness, charm or bottom, which can be found, in particular, in high energy heavy ions collisions.	It is shown that the large B multiskyrmions given by rational map ansaetze can be described reasonably well within the domain wall approximation, or as spherical bubble with energy and baryon number density concentrated at its boundary.
doc	Order formation processes of complex systems including different parity order parameters EOS In the present study, we focus on the parity of the order parameters and clarify the order formation process in a system including two order parameters. EOS Each order parameter shows each different parity under a gauge transformation, namely even and odd order parameters. EOS For example, in a spin-glass model, the even order parameter corresponds to the spin-glass order parameter while the odd one corresponds to the magnetization. EOS We introduce phenomenologically a set of Langevin equations to express the ordering process under a white Gaussian noise.	Using two kinds of Fokker-Planck equations, we analyze the order formation process and the entropy production.
doc	Quantum Secure Communication with W States EOS A W state is pair-wisely entangled, belonging to the different class from Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger (GHZ) state.

doc	Weak dependence and GMM estimation of supOU and mixed moving average processes EOS We consider a mixed moving average (MMA) process X driven by a L\'evy basis and prove that it is weakly dependent with rates computable in terms of the moving average kernel and the characteristic quadruple of the L\'evy basis. EOS Using this property, we show conditions ensuring that sample mean and autocovariances of X have a limiting normal distribution.	We extend these results to stochastic volatility models and then investigate a Generalized Method of Moments estimator for the supOU process and the supOU stochastic volatility model after choosing a suitable distribution for the mean reversion parameter.
doc	The Landau critical velocity for a particle in a Fermi superfluid EOS We determine \`a la Landau the critical velocity _EQN_ of a moving impurity in a Fermi superfluid, that is by restricting to the minimal excitation processes of the superfluid. EOS _EQN_ is then the minimal velocity at which these processes are energetically allowed. EOS The Fermi superfluid actually exhibits two excitation branches~: one is the fermionic pair-breaking excitation, as predicted by BCS theory; EOS the other one is bosonic and sets pairs into motion, as predicted by Anderson's RPA. EOS _EQN_ is the smallest of the two corresponding critical velocities _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS In the parameter space (superfluid interaction strength, fermion-to-impurity mass ratio), we identify two transition lines, corresponding to a discontinuity of the first-order and second-order derivatives of _EQN_. EOS These two lines meet in a triple point and split the plane in three domains. EOS We briefly extend this analysis to the very recently realized case at ENS, where the moving object in the Fermi superfluid is a weakly interacting Bose superfluid of impurities, rather than a single impurity.	For a Bose chemical potential much smaller than the Fermi energy, the topology of the transition lines is unaffected;

Surface tension brings the coexistance binodal surface to lower pressure.

doc	Numerical simulation of wave impact on a rigid wall using a two-phase compressible SPH method EOS In this paper, an SPH method based on the SPH-ALE formulation is used for modelling two-phase flows with large density ratios and realistic sound speeds. EOS The SPH scheme is further improved to circumvent the tensile instability that may occur in the SPH simulations. EOS The two-phase SPH solver is then used to model a benchmark problem of liquid impact on a rigid wall. EOS The results are compared with an incompressible Level Set solver. EOS Furthermore, a wave impact on a rigid wall with a large entrained air pocket is modelled.	The SPH simulation is initialised by the output of a fully non-linear potential flow solver.

The fundamental group of the complement _EQN_ is cyclic group of order _EQN_ if _EQN_ is homogeneous polynomial without _EQN_.
doc	Robust and efficient preconditioners for the discontinuous Galerkin time-stepping method EOS The discontinuous Galerkin time-stepping method has many advantageous properties for solving parabolic equations. EOS However, it requires the solution of a large nonsymmetric system at each time-step. EOS This work develops a fully robust and efficient preconditioning strategy for solving these systems. EOS Drawing on parabolic inf-sup theory, we first construct a left preconditioner that transforms the linear system to a symmetric positive definite problem to be solved by the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm.	We then prove that the transformed system can be further preconditioned by an ideal block diagonal preconditioner, leading to a condition number bounded by 4 for any time-step size, any approximation order and any positive-definite self-adjoint spatial operators.
doc	Bernstein functions and rates in mean ergodic theorems for operator semigroups EOS We present a functional calculus approach to the study of rates of decay in mean ergodic theorems for bounded strongly continuous operator semigroups.

doc	A Study of Dark Matter and QCD-Charged Mediators in the Quasi-Degenerate Regime EOS We study a scenario in which the only light new particles are a Majorana fermion dark matter candidate and one or more QCD-charged scalars, which couple to light quarks. EOS This scenario has several interesting phenomenological features if the new particles are nearly degenerate in mass. EOS In particular, LHC searches for the light scalars have reduced sensitivity, since the visible and invisible products tend to be softer. EOS Moreover, dark matter-scalar co-annihilation can allow even relatively heavy dark matter candidates to be consistent thermal relics.	Finally, the dark matter nucleon scattering cross section is enhanced in the quasi-degenerate limit, allowing direct detection experiments to use both spin-independent and spin-dependent scattering to probe regions of parameter space beyond those probed by the LHC.
doc	Early Evolution of Stellar Groups and Clusters: Environmental Effects on Forming Planetary Systems EOS This paper studies the dynamical evolution of young stellar clusters with _EQN_ = 100 - 1000 members. EOS We use N-body simulations to explore how evolution depends on system size _EQN_ and the initial conditions. EOS Motivated by recent observations of extremely young systems, this study compares subvirial and virial starting states. EOS Multiple realizations of equivalent cases (100 simulations per case) are used to build up a robust statistical description of these systems, e.g., distributions of closest approaches, mass profiles, and distributions of radial locations. EOS These results provide a framework from which to assess the effects of these clusters on star and planet formation. EOS The distributions of radial positions are used in conjunction with distributions of FUV luminosities (also calculated here) to determine the radiation exposure of circumstellar disks. EOS The distributions of closest approaches are used in conjunction with scattering cross sections (calculated here from _EQN_ scattering experiments) to determine the probability of solar system disruption. EOS We also use the nearby cluster NGC 1333 as a test case. EOS Our main conclusion is that clusters in this size range have only a modest effect on forming planetary systems: Interaction rates are low so that the typical solar system experiences a single encounter within 1000 AU.	Radiation exposure is low, with median FUV flux _EQN_ = 900, so that photoevaporation of disks is only important beyond 30 AU.
doc	Coupling to the continuous spectrum and HFB approximation EOS We propose a new method to solve the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equations for weakly bound nuclei whose purpose is to improve the treatment of the continuum when a finite range two-body interaction is used.	We replace the traditional expansion on a discrete harmonic oscillator basis by a mixed eigenfunction expansion associated with a potential that explicitely includes a continuous spectrum.
doc	Character varieties and harmonic maps to R-trees	We show that the Korevaar-Schoen limit of the sequence of equivariant harmonic maps corresponding to a sequence of irreducible _EQN_ representations of the fundamental group of a compact Riemannian manifold is an equivariant harmonic map to an _EQN_ -tree which is minimal and whose length function is projectively equivalent to the Morgan-Shalen limit of the sequence of representations.
doc	Nuclear Dependence of Charm Production EOS With data taken by SELEX, which accumulated data during the 1996-1997 fixed target run at Fermilab, we study the production of charmed hadrons on copper and carbon targets with Sigma-, p, pi-, and pi+ beams. EOS Parameterizing the production cross section A^alpha, A being the atomic number, we determine alpha for D+, D0, Ds+, D+(2010), Lambda_c+, and their respective anti-particles, as a function of their transverse momentum pt and scaled longitudinal momentum xF. EOS Within our statistics there is no dependence of alpha on xF for any charm species for the interval 0.1<xF<1.0.	The average value of alpha for charm production by pion beams is alpha_ meson =0.850+/-0.028.
doc	Sharp Garding inequality on compact Lie groups EOS In this paper the sharp Garding inequality is established on compact Lie groups.	The positivity condition is expressed in the non-commutative phase space in terms of the full symbol, which is defined using the representations of the group.
doc	Towards Neural Machine Translation with Latent Tree Attention EOS Building models that take advantage of the hierarchical structure of language without a priori annotation is a longstanding goal in natural language processing.	We introduce such a model for the task of machine translation, pairing a recurrent neural network grammar encoder with a novel attentional RNNG decoder and applying policy gradient reinforcement learning to induce unsupervised tree structures on both the source and target.
doc	On the Ohsawa-Takegoshi extension theorem	We establish a new extension result for twisted canonical forms defined on a hypersurface with simple normal crossings of a projective manifold.
doc	Quenching the CME via the gravitational anomaly and holography EOS In the presence of a gravitational contribution to the chiral anomaly, the chiral magnetic effect induces an energy current proportional to the square of the temperature in equilibrium. EOS In holography the thermal state corresponds to a black hole. EOS We numerically study holographic quenches in which a planar shell of scalar matter falls into a black hole and rises its temperature. EOS During the process the momentum density (energy current) is conserved. EOS The energy current has two components, a non-dissipative one induced by the anomaly and a dissipative flow component.	The dissipative component can be measured via the drag it asserts on an additional auxiliary color charge.
doc	A State-Dependent Polling Model with Markovian Routing EOS A state-dependent 1-limited polling model with N queues is analyzed. EOS The routing strategy generalizes the classical Markovian polling model, in the sense that two routing matrices are involved, the choice being made according to the state of the last visited queue. EOS The stationary distribution of the position of the server is given.	Ergodicity conditions are obtained by means of an associated dynamical system.

doc	Measuring the mixing scale of the ISM within nearby spiral galaxies EOS The spatial distribution of metals reflects, and can be used to constrain, the processes of chemical enrichment and mixing. EOS Using PHANGS-MUSE optical integral field spectroscopy, we measure the gas phase oxygen abundances (metallicities) across 7,138 HII regions in a sample of eight nearby disc galaxies. EOS In Paper I (Kreckel et al 2019) we measure and report linear radial gradients in the metallicities of each galaxy, and qualitatively searched for azimuthal abundance variations. EOS Here, we examine the two-dimensional variation in abundances once the radial gradient is subtracted, Delta(O/H), in order to quantify the homogeneity of the metal distribution and to measure the mixing scale over which HII region metallicities are correlated. EOS We observe low (0.03--0.05 dex) scatter in Delta(O/H) globally in all galaxies, with significantly lower (0.02--0.03 dex) scatter on small (<600 pc) spatial scales. EOS This is consistent with the measurement uncertainties, and implies the two-dimensional metallicity distribution is highly correlated on scales of <600 pc.	We compute the two point correlation function for metals in the disc in order to quantify the scale lengths associated with the observed homogeneity.

doc	Magnetizability of the relativistic hydrogenlike atom in an arbitrary discrete energy eigenstate: Application of the Sturmian expansion of the generalized Dirac-Coulomb Green function EOS The Sturmian expansion of the generalized Dirac--Coulomb Green function [R.\/~Szmytkowski, J.\ Phys.\ B \textbf 30, 825 (1997); EOS \textbf 30, 2747(E) (1997)] is exploited to derive a closed-form expression for the magnetizability of the relativistic one-electron atom in an arbitrary discrete state, with a point-like, spinless and motionless nucleus of charge _EQN_. EOS The result has the form of a double finite sum involving the generalized hypergeometric functions _EQN_ of the unit argument.	Our general expression agrees with formulas obtained analytically earlier by other authors for some particular states of the atom.
doc	Constructing regular ultrafilters from a model-theoretic point of view EOS This paper contributes to the set-theoretic side of understanding Keisler's order. EOS We consider properties of ultrafilters which affect saturation of unstable theories: the lower cofinality _EQN_ of _EQN_ modulo _EQN_, saturation of the minimum unstable theory (the random graph), flexibility, goodness, goodness for equality, and realization of symmetric cuts.	We work in ZFC except when noted, as several constructions appeal to complete ultrafilters thus assume a measurable cardinal.
doc	A Distributed and Deterministic TDMA Algorithm for Write-All-With-Collision Model EOS Several self-stabilizing time division multiple access (TDMA) algorithms are proposed for sensor networks. EOS In addition to providing a collision-free communication service, such algorithms enable the transformation of programs written in abstract models considered in distributed computing literature into a model consistent with sensor networks, i.e., write all with collision (WAC) model. EOS Existing TDMA slot assignment algorithms have one or more of the following properties: (i) compute slots using a randomized algorithm, (ii) assume that the topology is known upfront, and/or (iii) assign slots sequentially. EOS If these algorithms are used to transform abstract programs into programs in WAC model then the transformed programs are probabilistically correct, do not allow the addition of new nodes, and/or converge in a sequential fashion.	In this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing deterministic TDMA algorithm where a sensor is aware of only its neighbors.

doc	Towards a Practical Virtual Office for Mobile Knowledge Workers EOS As more people work from home or during travel, new opportunities and challenges arise around mobile office work. EOS On one hand, people may work at flexible hours, independent of traffic limitations, but on the other hand, they may need to work at makeshift spaces, with less than optimal working conditions and decoupled from co-workers. EOS Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to change the way information workers work: it enables personal bespoke working environments even on the go and allows new collaboration approaches that can help mitigate the effects of physical distance. EOS In this paper, we investigate opportunities and challenges for realizing a mobile VR offices environments and discuss implications from recent findings of mixing standard off-the-shelf equipment, such as tablets, laptops or desktops, with VR to enable effective, efficient, ergonomic, and rewarding mobile knowledge work.	Further, we investigate the role of conceptual and physical spaces in a mobile VR office.
doc	Blockchain and its Role in the Internet of Things (IoT) EOS Blockchain (BC) in the Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel technology that acts with decentralized, distributed, public and real-time ledger to store transactions among IoT nodes. EOS A blockchain is a series of blocks, each block is linked to its previous blocks. EOS Every block has the cryptographic hash code, previous block hash, and its data. EOS The transactions in BC are the basic units that are used to transfer data between IoT nodes. EOS The IoT nodes are different kind of physical but smart devices with embedded sensors, actuators, programs and able to communicate with other IoT nodes. EOS The role of BC in IoT is to provide a procedure to process secured records of data through IoT nodes. EOS BC is a secured technology that can be used publicly and openly. EOS IoT requires this kind of technology to allow secure communication among IoT nodes in heterogeneous environment. EOS The transactions in BC could be traced and explored through anyone who are authenticated to communicate within the IoT.	The BC in IoT may help to improve the communication security.
doc	Evolution of non-spherical pulsars with plasma-filled magnetospheres EOS Pulsars are famous for their rotational stability. EOS Most of them steadily spin down and display a highly repetitive pulse shape. EOS But some pulsars experience timing irregularities such as nulling, intermittency, mode changing and timing noise. EOS As changes in the pulse shape are often correlated with timing irregularities, precession is a possible cause of these phenomena. EOS Whereas pulsar magnetospheres are filled with plasma, most pulsar precession studies were carried out within the vacuum approximation and neglected the effects of magnetospheric currents and charges. EOS Recent numerical simulations of plasma-filled pulsar magnetospheres provide us with a detailed quantitative description of magnetospheric torques exerted on the pulsar surface.	In this paper, we present the study of neutron star evolution using these new torque expressions.
doc	An Efficient Neighborhood-based Interaction Model for Recommendation on Heterogeneous Graph EOS There is an influx of heterogeneous information network (HIN) based recommender systems in recent years since HIN is capable of characterizing complex graphs and contains rich semantics. EOS Although the existing approaches have achieved performance improvement, while practical, they still face the following problems. EOS On one hand, most existing HIN-based methods rely on explicit path reachability to leverage path-based semantic relatedness between users and items, e.g., metapath-based similarities. EOS These methods are hard to use and integrate since path connections are sparse or noisy, and are often of different lengths. EOS On the other hand, other graph-based methods aim to learn effective heterogeneous network representations by compressing node together with its neighborhood information into single embedding before prediction. EOS This weakly coupled manner in modeling overlooks the rich interactions among nodes, which introduces an early summarization issue. EOS In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Neighborhood-based Interaction Model for Recommendation (NIRec) to address the above problems. EOS Specifically, we first analyze the significance of learning interactions in HINs and then propose a novel formulation to capture the interactive patterns between each pair of nodes through their metapath-guided neighborhoods.	Then, to explore complex interactions between metapaths and deal with the learning complexity on large-scale networks, we formulate interaction in a convolutional way and learn efficiently with fast Fourier transform.

doc	Exciton absorption spectra in narrow armchair graphene nanoribbons in electric fields EOS We present an analytical investigation of the exciton optical absorption in a narrow armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) in the presence of a longitudinal external electric field directed parallel to the ribbon axis. EOS The two-body 2D Dirac equation for the massless electron and hole subject to the ribbon confinement, Coulomb interaction and electric field is employed. EOS The ribbon confinement is assumed to be much stronger than the internal exciton electric field which in turn considerably exceeds the external electric field. EOS This justifies an adiabatic approximation implying a slow longitudinal and fast transverse electron-hole relative motion governed by the exciton attraction and accompanied by the external electric field and ribbon confinement effects, respectively. EOS In the single subband approximation of the isolated size-quantized subbands induced by the ribbon confinement the exciton electroabsorption coefficient is determined in an explicit form. EOS The pronounced dependencies of the exciton peak positions, widths and intensities on the ribbon width and electric field strength are traced. EOS The electron-hole exciton attraction modifies remarkably the Franz-Keldysh electroabsorption in the frequency region both below and above the edges determined by the size-quantized energy levels. EOS In the double-subband approximation of the interacting ground and first excited subbands the combined effect of the exciton electro- and autoionization caused by the electric field and intersubband coupling, respectively, are explored.	Estimates of the expected experimental values for the typically employed AGNR show that for a weak electric field the exciton quasi-discrete states remain sufficiently stable to be observed in optical experiments, while relatively strong fields free the captured carriers to further restore their contribution to the transport.
doc	Push & Pull: autonomous deployment of mobile sensors for a complete coverage EOS Mobile sensor networks are important for several strategic applications devoted to monitoring critical areas. EOS In such hostile scenarios, sensors cannot be deployed manually and are either sent from a safe location or dropped from an aircraft. EOS Mobile devices permit a dynamic deployment reconfiguration that improves the coverage in terms of completeness and uniformity. EOS In this paper we propose a distributed algorithm for the autonomous deployment of mobile sensors called Push&Pull. EOS According to our proposal, movement decisions are made by each sensor on the basis of locally available information and do not require any prior knowledge of the operating conditions or any manual tuning of key parameters.	We formally prove that, when a sufficient number of sensors are available, our approach guarantees a complete and uniform coverage.

doc	Model-Based Reconstruction for Simultaneous Multi-Slice T1 Mapping using Single-Shot Inversion-Recovery Radial FLASH EOS Purpose: To develop a single-shot multi-slice T1 mapping method by combing simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) excitations, single-shot inversion-recovery (IR) radial fast low-angle shot (FLASH) and a nonlinear model-based reconstruction method. EOS Methods: SMS excitations are combined with a single-shot IR radial FLASH sequence for data acquisition. EOS A previously developed single-slice calibrationless model-based reconstruction is extended to SMS, formulating the estimation of parameter maps and coil sensitivities from all slices as a single nonlinear inverse problem. EOS Joint-sparsity constraints are further applied to the parameter maps to improve T1 precision. EOS Validations of the proposed method are performed for a phantom and for the human brain and liver in six healthy adult subjects. EOS Results: Phantom results confirm good T1 accuracy and precision of the simultaneously acquired multi-slice T1 maps in comparison to single-slice references. EOS In-vivo human brain studies demonstrate the better performance of SMS acquisitions compared to the conventional spoke-interleaved multi-slice acquisition using model-based reconstruction. EOS Apart from good accuracy and precision, the results of six healthy subjects in both brain and abdominal studies confirm good repeatability between scan and re-scans.	The proposed method can simultaneously acquire T1 maps for five slices of a human brain (_EQN_ mm _EQN_) or three slices of the abdomen (_EQN_ mm _EQN_) within four seconds.
doc	From Recommendation Systems to Facility Location Games EOS Recommendation systems are extremely popular tools for matching users and contents. EOS However, when content providers are strategic, the basic principle of matching users to the closest content, where both users and contents are modeled as points in some semantic space, may yield low social welfare. EOS This is due to the fact that content providers are strategic and optimize their offered content to be recommended to as many users as possible. EOS Motivated by modern applications, we propose the widely studied framework of facility location games to study recommendation systems with strategic content providers. EOS Our conceptual contribution is the introduction of a _EQN_ to facility location models, in the pursuit of better social welfare. EOS We aim at designing mediators that a) induce a game with high social welfare in equilibrium, and b) intervene as little as possible. EOS In service of the latter, we introduce the notion of _EQN_, which quantifies how much damage a mediator may cause to the social welfare when an off-equilibrium profile is adopted. EOS As a case study in high-welfare low-intervention mediator design, we consider the one-dimensional segment as the user domain. EOS We propose a mediator that implements the socially optimal strategy profile as the unique equilibrium profile, and show a tight bound on its intervention cost.	Ultimately, we consider some extensions, and highlight open questions for the general agenda.

doc	Dynamical Gap and Cuprate-like Physics from Holography EOS We study the properties of fermion correlators in a boundary theory dual to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om AdS_ d+1 background in the presence of a bulk dipole (Pauli) interaction term with strength p. EOS We show that by simply changing the value of the parameter p we can tune continuously from a Fermi liquid (small p), to a marginal Fermi liquid behavior at a critical value of p, to a generic non-Fermi liquid at intermediate values of p, and finally to a Mott insulator at large values of the bulk Pauli coupling. EOS As all of these phases are seen in the cuprate phase diagram, the holographic model we study has the key elements of the strong coupling physics typified by Mott systems. EOS In addition, we extend our analysis to finite temperature and show that the Mott gap closes. EOS Of particular interest is that it closes when the ratio of the gap to the critical temperature is of the order of ten. EOS This behavior is very much similar to that observed in the classic Mott insulator VO_2. EOS We then analyze the non-analyticities of the boundary theory fermion correlators for generic values of frequency and momentum by calculating the quasi-normal modes of the bulk fermions.	Not surprisingly, we find no evidence for the dipole interaction inducing an instability in the boundary theory.

doc	Casimir Effect, Weyl Anomaly and Displacement Operator in Boundary Conformal Field Theory EOS In this paper, we investigate Casimir effect, Weyl anomaly and displacement operator for boundary conformal field theory in general dimensions. EOS We find universal relations between them. EOS In particular, they are all determined by the central charge of boundary conformal field theory. EOS We verify these relations by studying free BCFTs and holographic BCFTs.	As a byproduct, we obtain the holographic two point function of stress tensor when the bulk boundary is perpendicular to the AdS boundary.
doc	Regge calculus models of closed lattice universes EOS This paper examines the behaviour of closed `lattice universes' wherein masses are distributed in a regular lattice on the Cauchy surfaces of closed vacuum universes.

We consider two types of lattice universes, one where all masses are identical to each other and another where one mass gets perturbed in magnitude.
doc	Automatic Identification of Twin Zygosity in Resting-State Functional MRI EOS A key strength of twin studies arises from the fact that there are two types of twins, monozygotic and dizygotic, that share differing amounts of genetic information. EOS Accurate differentiation of twin types allows efficient inference on genetic influences in a population. EOS However, identification of zygosity is often prone to errors without genotying. EOS In this study, we propose a novel pairwise feature representation to classify the zygosity of twin pairs of resting state functional magnetic resonance images (rs-fMRI).	For this, we project an fMRI signal to a set of basis functions and use the projection coefficients as the compact and discriminative feature representation of noisy fMRI.
doc	Scaling laws for magnetic fields on the quiet Sun EOS The Sun's magnetic field is structured over a range of scales that span approximately seven orders of magnitudes, four of which lie beyond the resolving power of current telescopes. EOS Here we have used a Hinode SOT/SP deep mode data set for the quiet-sun disk center in combination with constraints from the Hanle effect to derive scaling laws that describe how the magnetic structuring varies from the resolved scales down to the magnetic diffusion limit, where the field ceases to be frozen-in. EOS The focus of the analysis is a derivation of the magnetic energy spectrum, but we also discuss the scale dependence of the probability density function (PDF) for the flux densities and the role of the cancellation function for the average unsigned flux density.	Analysis of the Hinode data set with the line-ratio method reveals a collapsed flux population in the form of flux tubes with a size distribution that is peaked in the 10-100 km range.
doc	First order radiative corrections to Bhabha scattering in _EQN_ dimensions EOS The luminosity measurement at the projected International Linear _EQN_ Collider ILC is planned to be performed with forward Bhabha scattering with an accuracy of the order of _EQN_. EOS A theoretical prediction of the differential cross-section has to include one-loop weak corrections, with leading higher order terms, and the complete two-loop QED corrections. EOS Here, we present the weak part and the virtual one-loop photonic corrections. EOS For the photonic corrections, the expansions in _EQN_ are derived with inclusion of the terms of order _EQN_ in order to match the two-loop accuracy.	For the photonic box master integral in _EQN_ dimensions we compare several different methods of evaluation.

The evolution of dark energy, Hubble, and deceleration parameters etc., have been described in the form of tables and figures.
doc	Constraints on Anomalous Quaric Gauge Boson Couplings from vv gamma gamma and qq gamma gamma events at LEP 2 EOS Anomalous quartic couplings between the electroweak gauge bosons may contribute to the vv gamma gamma and qq gamma gamma final states produced in e+e- collisions. EOS This analysis uses the LEP2 OPAL data sample at centre-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV. EOS Event selections identify vv gamma gamma and qq gamma gamma events in which the two photons are reconstructed within the detector acceptance. EOS The cross-section for the process e+e- -> qq gamma gamma is measured. EOS Averaging over all energies, the ratio of the observed e+e- -> qq gamma gamma cross-section to the Standard Model expectation is R(data/SM) = 0.92 +- 0.07 +- 0.04 where the errors represent the statistical and systematic uncertainties respectively. EOS The vv gamma gamma and qq gamma gamma data are used to constrain possible anomalous W+W- gamma gamma and ZZ gamma gamma couplings. EOS Combining with previous OPAL results from the W+W- gamma final state, the 95% confidence level limits on the anomalous coupling parameters aoz, acz, aow and acw are found to be: -0.007 GeV^-2 < aoz/Lambda^2 < 0.023 GeV^-2 -0.029 GeV^-2 < acz/Lambda^2 < 0.029 GeV^-2 -0.020 GeV^-2 < aow/Lambda^2 < 0.020 GeV^-2 -0.052 GeV^-2 < acw/Lambda^2 < 0.037 GeV^-2 where Lamdba is the energy scale of the new physics.	Limits found when allowing two or more parameters to vary are also presented.

The betatron amplitudes and phase advances of the projections of the normal modes on the horizontal and vertical planes are then extracted, which, combined with dispersion measurement, are used to fit the lattice model.
doc	Pulse dependence of prevalent pathways in xenon driven by an x-ray free-electron-laser pulse EOS We study the interaction of xenon with an 850 eV photon energy FEL pulse. EOS We do so by employing a Monte-Carlo technique. EOS We compute the single-photon ionisation cross sections and Auger rates, used in the Monte-Carlo technique, by adopting to atoms a formalism we previously developed for diatomic molecules. EOS We determine the yields of the ion states of driven xenon and compare with previously obtained experimental results. EOS To better understand the yields obtained, we identify the prevalent pathways leading to the formation of each final ion state of xenon.	We gain further insight into the high yields of highly-charged ion states by comparing the yields and dominant pathways of these ion states of xenon when driven by different FEL pulses that have the same energy.
doc	Interference Alignment for Line-of-Sight Channels EOS The fully connected K-user interference channel is studied in a multipath environment with bandwidth W. EOS We show that when each link consists of D physical paths, the total spectral efficiency can grow linearly with K. EOS This result holds not merely in the limit of large transmit power P, but for any fixed P, and is therefore a stronger characterization than degrees of freedom. EOS It is achieved via a form of interference alignment in the time domain. EOS A caveat of this result is that W must grow with K, a phenomenon we refer to as bandwidth scaling. EOS Our insight comes from examining channels with single path links (D=1), which we refer to as line-of-sight (LOS) links.	For such channels we build a time-indexed interference graph and associate the communication problem with finding its maximal independent set.
doc	A record of the final phase of giant planet migration fossilized in the asteroid belt's orbital structure EOS The asteroid belt is characterized by an extreme low total mass of material on dynamically excited orbits. EOS The Nice Model explains many peculiar qualities of the solar system, including the belt's excited state, by invoking an orbital instability between the outer planets. EOS However, previous studies of the Nice Model's effect on the belt's structure struggle to reproduce the innermost asteroids' orbital inclination distribution. EOS Here, we show how the final phase of giant planet migration sculpts the asteroid belt, in particular its inclination distribution.	As interactions with leftover planetesimals cause Saturn to move away from Jupiter, its rate of orbital precession slows as the two planets' mutual interactions weaken.
doc	Once-for-All: Train One Network and Specialize it for Efficient Deployment EOS We address the challenging problem of efficient inference across many devices and resource constraints, especially on edge devices. EOS Conventional approaches either manually design or use neural architecture search (NAS) to find a specialized neural network and train it from scratch for each case, which is computationally prohibitive (causing _EQN_ emission as much as 5 cars' lifetime) thus unscalable. EOS In this work, we propose to train a once-for-all (OFA) network that supports diverse architectural settings by decoupling training and search, to reduce the cost. EOS We can quickly get a specialized sub-network by selecting from the OFA network without additional training. EOS To efficiently train OFA networks, we also propose a novel progressive shrinking algorithm, a generalized pruning method that reduces the model size across many more dimensions than pruning (depth, width, kernel size, and resolution).	It can obtain a surprisingly large number of sub-networks (_EQN_) that can fit different hardware platforms and latency constraints while maintaining the same level of accuracy as training independently.
doc	The ASAS-SN Catalog of Variable Stars II: Uniform Classification of 412,000 Known Variables EOS The variable stars in the VSX catalog are derived from a multitude of inhomogeneous data sources and classification tools. EOS This inhomogeneity complicates our understanding of variable star types, statistics, and properties, and it directly affects attempts to build training sets for current (and next) generation all-sky, time-domain surveys. EOS We homogeneously analyze the ASAS-SN V-band light curves of _EQN_ variables from the VSX catalog. EOS The variables are classified using an updated random forest classifier with an _EQN_ score of 99.4% and refinement criteria for individual classifications.	We have derived periods for _EQN_ variables in the VSX catalog that lack a period, and have reclassified _EQN_ sources into new broad variability groups with high confidence.
doc	Penalized basis models for very large spatial datasets EOS Many modern spatial models express the stochastic variation component as a basis expansion with random coefficients. EOS Low rank models, approximate spectral decompositions, multiresolution representations, stochastic partial differential equations and empirical orthogonal functions all fall within this basic framework. EOS Given a particular basis, stochastic dependence relies on flexible modeling of the coefficients. EOS Under a Gaussianity assumption, we propose a graphical model family for the stochastic coefficients by parameterizing the precision matrix. EOS Sparsity in the precision matrix is encouraged using a penalized likelihood framework.	Computations follow from a majorization-minimization approach, a byproduct of which is a connection to the graphical lasso.

EOS We use a quasi-2D hopper containing photoelastic particles to obtain stress/force information. EOS We simultaneously measure the particle motion and stress. EOS We determine several properties, including discharge rates, jamming probabilities, and the number of particles in clogging arches.	For both particle types, the size of the opening, _EQN_, relative to the size of particles, _EQN_ is an important dimensionless measure.
doc	Present and Future Bounds on Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions EOS We consider Non-Standard neutrino Interactions (NSI), described by four-fermion operators of the form _EQN_, where _EQN_ is an electron or first generation quark. EOS We assume these operators are generated at dimension _EQN_, so the related vertices involving charged leptons, obtained by an SU(2) transformation _EQN_, do not appear at tree level. EOS These related vertices necessarily arise at one loop, via _EQN_ exchange. EOS We catalogue current constraints from _EQN_ measurements in neutrino scattering, from atmospheric neutrino observations, from LEP, and from bounds on the related charged lepton operators. EOS We estimate future bounds from comparing KamLAND and solar neutrino data, and from measuring _EQN_ at the near detector of a neutrino factory. EOS Operators constructed with _EQN_ and _EQN_ should not confuse the determination of oscillation parameters at a _EQN_ factory, because the processes we consider are more sensitive than oscillations at the far detector.	For operators involving _EQN_, we estimate similar sensitivities at the near and far detector.
doc	Tight-binding electronic spectra on graphs with spherical topology. I. The effect of a magnetic charge EOS This is the first of two papers devoted to tight-binding electronic spectra on graphs with the topology of the sphere. EOS In this work the one-electron spectrum is investigated as a function of the radial magnetic field produced by a magnetic charge sitting at the center of the sphere. EOS The latter is an integer multiple of the quantized magnetic charge of the Dirac monopole, that integer defining the gauge sector. EOS An analysis of the spectrum is carried out for the five Platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron), the C _EQN_ fullerene, and two families of polyhedra, the diamonds and the prisms.	Except for the fullerene, all the spectra are obtained in closed form.

doc	Transform-Based Multilinear Dynamical System for Tensor Time Series Analysis EOS We propose a novel multilinear dynamical system (MLDS) in a transform domain, named _EQN_ -MLDS, to model tensor time series. EOS With transformations applied to a tensor data, the latent multidimensional correlations among the frontal slices are built, and thus resulting in the computational independence in the transform domain. EOS This allows the exact separability of the multi-dimensional problem into multiple smaller LDS problems. EOS To estimate the system parameters, we utilize the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to determine the parameters of each LDS. EOS Further, _EQN_ -MLDSs significantly reduce the model parameters and allows parallel processing. EOS Our general _EQN_ -MLDS model is implemented based on different transforms: discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform and discrete wavelet transform. EOS Due to the nonlinearity of these transformations, _EQN_ -MLDS is able to capture the nonlinear correlations within the data unlike the MLDS REF which assumes multi-way linear correlations. EOS Using four real datasets, the proposed _EQN_ -MLDS is shown to achieve much higher prediction accuracy than the state-of-the-art MLDS and LDS with an equal number of parameters under different noise models.	In particular, the relative errors are reduced by _EQN_.

EOS The existence of a binary companion has been hinted by indirect observational evidence, such as the bipolar morphology of its nebula and a spiral-like pattern in its circumstellar material; EOS however, to date, no companion has been identified. EOS We have examined archival Hubble Space Telescope images of IRC+10216, and find that the images taken in 2011 exhibit dramatic changes in its innermost region from those taken at earlier epochs. EOS The scattered light is more spread out in 2011. EOS After proper motion correction, the brightest peak in 2011 is close to, but not coincident with, the dominant peak in previous epochs. EOS A fainter point-like object was revealed at about 0.5 arcsec from this brightest peak.	We suggest that these changes at the core of IRC+10216 are caused by dissipation of intervening circumstellar dust, as indicated by the brightening trend in the lightcurve extracted from the Catalina photometric survey.
doc	backbone: An R Package for extracting the backbone of bipartite projections EOS Bipartite projections are used in a wide range of network contexts including politics (bill co-sponsorship), genetics (gene co-expression), economics (executive board co-membership), and innovation (patent co-authorship). EOS However, because bipartite projections are always weighted graphs, which are inherently challenging to analyze and visualize, it is often useful to examine the 'backbone', an unweighted subgraph containing only the most significant edges.	In this paper, we introduce the R package backbone for extracting the backbone of weighted bipartite projections, and use bill sponsorship data from the 114th session of the United States Senate to demonstrate its functionality.
doc	Three New Results on Continuation Criteria for the 3D Relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell System EOS In this paper, we consider sufficient conditions, called continuation criteria, for global existence and uniqueness of classical solutions to the three-dimensional relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system. EOS In the compact momentum support setting, we prove that _EQN_, where _EQN_ and _EQN_ is arbitrarily small, is a continuation criteria.	The previously best known continuation criteria in the compact setting is _EQN_, where _EQN_ and _EQN_ is arbitrarily small, is due to work by Kunze.

doc	Pre-Inflation in the Presence of Conformal Coupling EOS We consider a massless scalar field, conformally coupled to the Ricci scalar curvature, in the pre-inflation era of a closed FLRW Universe. EOS The scalar field potential can be of the form of the Coleman-Weinberg one-loop potential, which is flat at the origin and drives the inflationary evolution. EOS For positive values of the conformal parameter \xi, less than the critical value xi_c=(1/6), the model admits exact solutions with non-zero scale factor and zero initial Hubble parameter. EOS Thus these solutions can be matched smoothly to the so called Pre-Big-Bang models.	At the end of this pre-inflation era one can match inflationary solutions by specifying the form of the potential and the whole solution is of the class C^(1).
doc	Notions of Centralized and Decentralized Opacity in Linear Systems EOS We formulate notions of opacity for cyberphysical systems modeled as discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. EOS A set of secret states is _EQN_ -ISO with respect to a set of nonsecret states if, starting from these sets at time _EQN_, the outputs at time _EQN_ are indistinguishable to an adversarial observer. EOS Necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that a secret specification is _EQN_ -ISO are established in terms of sets of reachable states. EOS We also show how to adapt techniques for computing under-approximations and over-approximations of the set of reachable states of dynamical systems in order to soundly approximate k-ISO. EOS Further, we provide a condition for output controllability, if _EQN_ -ISO holds, and show that the converse holds under an additional assumption.	We extend the theory of opacity for single-adversary systems to the case of multiple adversaries and develop several notions of decentralized opacity.
doc	Avoiding Latent Variable Collapse With Generative Skip Models EOS Variational autoencoders learn distributions of high-dimensional data. EOS They model data with a deep latent-variable model and then fit the model by maximizing a lower bound of the log marginal likelihood. EOS VAEs can capture complex distributions, but they can also suffer from an issue known as "latent variable collapse," especially if the likelihood model is powerful. EOS Specifically, the lower bound involves an approximate posterior of the latent variables; EOS this posterior "collapses" when it is set equal to the prior, i.e., when the approximate posterior is independent of the data. EOS While VAEs learn good generative models, latent variable collapse prevents them from learning useful representations. EOS In this paper, we propose a simple new way to avoid latent variable collapse by including skip connections in our generative model; EOS these connections enforce strong links between the latent variables and the likelihood function. EOS We study generative skip models both theoretically and empirically.	Theoretically, we prove that skip models increase the mutual information between the observations and the inferred latent variables.
doc	Grad-Shafranov equation in noncircular stationary axisymmetric spacetimes EOS A formulation is developed for general relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamics in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. EOS We reduce basic equations to a single second-order partial differential equation, the so-called Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation. EOS Our formulation is most general in the sense that it is applicable even when a stationary axisymmetric spacetime is noncircular, that is, even when it is impossible to foliate a spacetime with two orthogonal families of two-surfaces.	The GS equation for noncircular spacetimes is crucial for the study of relativistic stars with a toroidal magnetic field or meridional flow, such as magnetars, since the existence of a toroidal field or meridional flow violates the circularity of a spacetime.
doc	Image Annotation using Multi-Layer Sparse Coding EOS Automatic annotation of images with descriptive words is a challenging problem with vast applications in the areas of image search and retrieval. EOS This problem can be viewed as a label-assignment problem by a classifier dealing with a very large set of labels, i.e., the vocabulary set. EOS We propose a novel annotation method that employs two layers of sparse coding and performs coarse-to-fine labeling. EOS Themes extracted from the training data are treated as coarse labels. EOS Each theme is a set of training images that share a common subject in their visual and textual contents. EOS Our system extracts coarse labels for training and test images without requiring any prior knowledge. EOS Vocabulary words are the fine labels to be associated with images. EOS Most of the annotation methods achieve low recall due to the large number of available fine labels, i.e., vocabulary words. EOS These systems also tend to achieve high precision for highly frequent words only while relatively rare words are more important for search and retrieval purposes. EOS Our system not only outperforms various previously proposed annotation systems, but also achieves symmetric response in terms of precision and recall.	Our system scores and maintains high precision for words with a wide range of frequencies.
doc	Relative Framing of Transverse knots EOS It is well-known that a knot in a contact manifold _EQN_ transverse to a trivialized contact structure possesses the natural framing given by the first of the trivialization vectors along the knot.	If the Euler class _EQN_ of _EQN_ is nonzero, then _EQN_ is nontrvivializable and the natural framing of transverse knots does not exist.

EOS METHODS: A prostate phantom was created. EOS A three-dimensional real-time ultrasound system with a 5.9MHz probe was used, making it possible to see several reconstructed orthogonal viewing planes in real time. EOS Fourteen operators performed biopsies first under 2-D then 4-D transurethral ultrasound (TRUS) guidance (336 biopsies). EOS The biopsy path was modelled using segmentation in a 3-D ultrasonographic volume.	Special software was used to visualise the biopsy paths in a reference prostate and assess the sampled area.
doc	Clump Distance to the Magellanic Clouds and Anomalous Colors in the Galactic Bulge EOS I demonstrate that the two unexpected results in the local Universe: 1) anomalous intrinsic (V-I)_0 colors of the clump giants and RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic center, and 2) very short distances to the Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) as inferred from clump giants, are connected with each other. EOS The (V-I)_0 anomaly is partially resolved by using the photometry from the phase-II of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) rather than phase-I. EOS The need for V- or I-magnitude-based change in the bulge (V-I)_0 is one option to explain the remaining color discrepancy. EOS Such change may originate in a coefficient of selective extinction A_V/E(V-I) smaller than typically assumed. EOS Application of the (V-I)_0 correction (independent of its source) doubles the slope of the absolute magnitude - metallicity relation for clump giants, so that M_I(RC) = -0.23 + 0.19[Fe/H].	Consequently, the estimates of the clump distances to the LMC and SMC are affected.
doc	Core-collapse supernova equations of state based on neutron star observations EOS Many of the currently available equations of state for core-collapse supernova simulations give large neutron star radii and do not provide large enough neutron star masses, both of which are inconsistent with some recent neutron star observations. EOS In addition, one of the critical uncertainties in the nucleon-nucleon interaction, the nuclear symmetry energy, is not fully explored by the currently available equations of state.	In this article, we construct two new equations of state which match recent neutron star observations and provide more flexibility in studying the dependence on nuclear matter properties.
doc	The KIC 8462852 Light Curve From 2015.75 to 2018.18 Shows a Variable Secular Decline EOS The star KIC 8462852 (Boyajian's Star) displays both fast dips of up to 20% on time scales of days, plus long-term secular fading by up to 19% on time scales from a year to a century.	We report on CCD photometry of KIC 8462852 from 2015.75 to 2018.18, with 19,176 images making for 1,866 nightly magnitudes in BVRI.
doc	Kosniowski's conjecture and weights EOS The conjecture of Kosniowski asserts that if the circle acts on a compact unitary manifold _EQN_ with a non-empty fixed point set and _EQN_ does not bound a unitary manifold equivariantly, then the dimension of the manifold is bounded above by a linear function on the number of fixed points. EOS We confirm the conjecture for almost complex manifolds under an assumption on weights.	For instance, we confirm the conjecture if there is one type _EQN_ of weights, or there are two types _EQN_, _EQN_ of weights.
doc	Mitigation of the instrumental noise transient in gravitational-wave data surrounding GW170817 EOS In the coming years gravitational-wave detectors will undergo a series of improvements, with an increase in their detection rate by about an order of magnitude. EOS Routine detections of gravitational-wave signals promote novel astrophysical and fundamental theory studies, while simultaneously leading to an increase in the number of detections temporally overlapping with instrumentally- or environmentally-induced transients in the detectors (glitches), often of unknown origin.	Indeed, this was the case for the very first detection by the LIGO and Virgo detectors of a gravitational-wave signal consistent with a binary neutron star coalescence, GW170817.
doc	Considerations in the Time-Energy Uncertainty Relation from the Viewpointt of Hypothesis Testing EOS It is difficult to discriminate between the state of initial time _EQN_ and that of time _EQN_. EOS The task of discriminating between the two states can be interpreted as the hypothesis testing problem as to a state _EQN_ deciding whether _EQN_ is _EQN_ or _EQN_ We show the process of optimization of this hypotheses testing and the condition that discrimination between the two states become difficult even when optimized test was executed.	In addition, We consider time-enegy uncertainty relation from the viewpoint of optimized hypotheses testing.
doc	Background Assay and Rejection in DRIFT EOS The DRIFT-IId dark matter detector is a m _EQN_ -scale low-pressure TPC with directional sensitivity to WIMP-induced nuclear recoils. EOS Its primary backgrounds were due to alpha decays from contamination on the central cathode. EOS Efforts to reduce these backgrounds led to replacing the 20 \mu m wire central cathode with one constructed from 0.9 \mu m aluminized mylar, which is almost totally transparent to alpha particles. EOS Detailed modeling of the nature and origin of the remaining backgrounds led to an in-situ, ppt-sensitive assay of alpha decay backgrounds from the central cathode.	This led to further improvements in the thin-film cathode resulting in over 2 orders of magnitude reduction in backgrounds compared to the wire cathode.
doc	A Unifying Tool for Bounding the Quality of Non-Cooperative Solutions in Weighted Congestion Games EOS We present a general technique, based on a primal-dual formulation, for analyzing the quality of self-emerging solutions in weighted congestion games. EOS With respect to traditional combinatorial approaches, the primal-dual schema has at least three advantages: first, it provides an analytic tool which can always be used to prove tight upper bounds for all the cases in which we are able to characterize exactly the polyhedron of the solutions under analysis; EOS secondly, in each such a case the complementary slackness conditions give us an hint on how to construct matching lower bounding instances; EOS thirdly, proofs become simpler and easy to check. EOS For the sake of exposition, we first apply our technique to the problems of bounding the prices of anarchy and stability of exact and approximate pure Nash equilibria, as well as the approximation ratio of the solutions achieved after a one-round walk starting from the empty strategy profile, in the case of affine latency functions and we show how all the known upper bounds for these measures (and some of their generalizations) can be easily reobtained under a unified approach. EOS Then, we use the technique to attack the more challenging setting of polynomial latency functions. EOS In particular, we obtain the first known upper bounds on the price of stability of pure Nash equilibria and on the approximation ratio of the solutions achieved after a one-round walk starting from the empty strategy profile for unweighted players in the cases of quadratic and cubic latency functions.	We believe that our technique, thanks to its versatility, may prove to be a powerful tool also in several other applications.
doc	Magnetic Fields in Population III Star Formation EOS We study the buildup of magnetic fields during the formation of Population III star-forming regions, by conducting cosmological simulations from realistic initial conditions and varying the Jeans resolution. EOS To investigate this in detail, we start simulations from identical initial conditions, mandating 16, 32 and 64 zones per Jeans length, and studied the variation in their magnetic field amplification. EOS We find that, while compression results in some amplification, turbulent velocity fluctuations driven by the collapse can further amplify an initially weak seed field via dynamo action, provided there is sufficient numerical resolution to capture vortical motions (we find this requirement to be 64 zones per Jeans length, slightly larger than, but consistent with previous work run with more idealized collapse scenarios). EOS We explore saturation of amplification of the magnetic field, which could potentially become dynamically important in subsequent, fully-resolved calculations.	We have also identified a relatively surprising phenomena that is purely hydrodynamic: the higher-resolved simulations possess substantially different characteristics, including higher infall-velocity, increased temperatures inside 1000 AU, and decreased molecular hydrogen content in the innermost region.

doc	Line-of-sight velocity dispersions and a mass distribution model of the Sa galaxy NGC 4594 EOS In the present paper we develop an algorithm allowing to calculate line-of-sight velocity dispersions in an axisymmetric galaxy outside of the galactic plane. EOS When constructing a self-consistent model, we take into account the galactic surface brightness distribution, stellar rotation curve and velocity dispersions. EOS This algorithm is applied to a Sa galaxy NGC 4594 = M 104, for which there exist velocity dispersion measurements outside of the galactic major axis. EOS The mass distribution model is constructed in two stages. EOS In the first stage we construct a luminosity distribution model, where only galactic surface brightness distribution is taken into account. EOS Thereafter, in the second stage we develop on the basis of the Jeans equations a detailed mass distribution model and calculate line-of-sight velocity dispersions and the stellar rotation curve. EOS Here a dark matter halo is added to visible components. EOS Calculated dispersions are compared with observations along different slit positions perpendicular and parallel to the galactic major axis. EOS In the best-fitting model velocity dispersion ellipsoids are radially elongated.	Outside the galactic plane velocity dispersion behaviour is more sensitive to the dark matter density distribution and allows to estimate dark halo parameters.
doc	Mid-infrared Multi-wavelength Imaging of Ophiuchus\,IRS\,48\,Transitional Disk EOS Transitional disks around the Herbig Ae/Be stars are fascinating targets in the contexts of disk evolution and also planet formation. EOS Oph IRS 48 is one of such Herbig Ae stars, which shows an inner dust cavity and azimuthally lopsided large dust distribution. EOS We present new images of Oph IRS 48 at eight mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths from 8.59 to 24.6\, _EQN_ taken with the COMICS mounted on the 8.2\,m Subaru Telescope. EOS The N-band (7 to 13\, _EQN_) images show that the flux distribution is centrally peaked with a slight spatial extent, while the Q-band (17 to 25\, _EQN_) images show asymmetric double peaks (east and west). EOS Using 18.8 and 24.6\, _EQN_ m images, we derived the dust temperature at both east and west peaks to be 135 _EQN_ 22 K. EOS Thus, the asymmetry may not be attributed to a difference in the temperature. EOS % thus other reason is necessary to explain the asymmetry of east and west peaks in Q-band.	Comparing our results with previous modeling works, we conclude that the inner disk is aligned to the outer disk.

EOS In both cases, spectral fitting reveals two statistically acceptable continuum models: Compton reflection and partial covering.	Both spectra have strong iron K-alpha lines, with equivalent widths greater than 1.5 keV.
doc	The Southern Sky Redshift Survey EOS We report redshifts, magnitudes and morphological classifications for 5369 galaxies with _EQN_ and 57 galaxies fainter than this limit, in two regions covering a total of 1.70 steradians in the southern celestial hemisphere. EOS The galaxy catalog is drawn primarily from the list of non-stellar objects identified in the Guide Star Catalog (Lasker et al 1990, AJ 99, 2019; EOS hereafter GSC). EOS The galaxies have positions accurate to about 1 arc sec and magnitudes with an rms scatter of about 0.3 mag. EOS We compute magnitudes (_EQN_) from the relation between instrumental GSC magnitudes and the photometry by Lauberts & Valentijn (1989). EOS From a comparison with CCD photometry, we find that our system is homogeneous across the sky and corresponds to magnitudes measured at the isophotal level _EQN_ 26 mag arcsec _EQN_.	The precision of the radial velocities is of \sim 40 km/s and the redshift survey is more than 99% complete to the _EQN_ = 15.5 magnitude limit.
doc	Quantum generalizations of the polynomial hierarchy with applications to QMA(2) EOS The polynomial-time hierarchy (_EQN_) has proven to be a powerful tool for providing separations in computational complexity theory (modulo standard conjectures such as _EQN_ does not collapse). EOS Here, we study whether two quantum generalizations of _EQN_ can similarly prove separations in the quantum setting. EOS The first generalization, _EQN_, uses classical proofs, and the second, _EQN_, uses quantum proofs. EOS For the former, we show quantum variants of the Karp-Lipton theorem and Toda's theorem. EOS For the latter, we place its third level, _EQN_, into _EQN_ using the Ellipsoid Method for efficiently solving semidefinite programs. EOS These results yield two implications for _EQN_, the variant of Quantum Merlin-Arthur (_EQN_) with two unentangled proofs, a complexity class whose characterization has proven difficult.	First, if _EQN_ (i.e., alternating quantifiers are sufficiently powerful so as to make classical and quantum proofs "equivalent"), then _EQN_ is in the Counting Hierarchy (specifically, in _EQN_).
doc	The Scalar Curvature of a Causal Set EOS A one parameter family of retarded linear operators on scalar fields on causal sets is introduced. EOS When the causal set is well-approximated by 4 dimensional Minkowski spacetime, the operators are Lorentz invariant but nonlocal, are parametrised by the scale of the nonlocality and approximate the continuum scalar D'Alembertian, _EQN_, when acting on fields that vary slowly on the nonlocality scale.	The same operators can be applied to scalar fields on causal sets which are well-approximated by curved spacetimes in which case they approximate _EQN_ where _EQN_ is the Ricci scalar curvature.
doc	Semiclassical (QFT) and Quantum (String) anti - de Sitter Regimes: New Results EOS We compute the quantum string entropy S_s(m, H) from the microscopic string density of states of mass m in Anti de Sitter space-time. EOS For high m, (high Hm -->c/\alpha'), no phase transition occurs at the Anti de Sitter string temperature T_ s which is higher than the flat space (Hagedorn) temperature t_ s. EOS (the Hubble constant H acts as producing a smaller string constant and thus, a higher tension).	T_s is the precise quantum dual of the semiclassical (QFT) Anti de Sitter temperature scale.
doc	Conv-Transformer Transducer: Low Latency, Low Frame Rate, Streamable End-to-End Speech Recognition EOS Transformer has achieved competitive performance against state-of-the-art end-to-end models in automatic speech recognition (ASR), and requires significantly less training time than RNN-based models. EOS The original Transformer, with encoder-decoder architecture, is only suitable for offline ASR. EOS It relies on an attention mechanism to learn alignments, and encodes input audio bidirectionally. EOS The high computation cost of Transformer decoding also limits its use in production streaming systems. EOS To make Transformer suitable for streaming ASR, we explore Transducer framework as a streamable way to learn alignments. EOS For audio encoding, we apply unidirectional Transformer with interleaved convolution layers. EOS The interleaved convolution layers are used for modeling future context which is important to performance.	To reduce computation cost, we gradually downsample acoustic input, also with the interleaved convolution layers.

Given an Euclidean polyhedral surface, its Riemannian metric is represented as edge lengths, satisfying triangle inequalities on all faces.

However, the vast majority of research in these systems has focused on the linear domain, i.e., where inter-particle interactions do not play a role.

EOS Gromov posed the question Bound the expansion coefficient from below in terms of the observable diameter. EOS The overall aim of the current study is to demonstrate the answer to this problem. EOS To begin solving this problem, the concentration of measure phenomenon on the metric measure space must be considered. EOS The concentration function to evaluate the measure phenomenon is connected by the observable diameter and the expansion coefficient. EOS Furthermore, the procedure for our answer gives us the upper bound for the expansion coefficient in terms of the observable diameter.	Combining the desired lower bound for the expansion coefficient with its upper bound, we eventually obtain the upper bound for the observable diameter.

EOS Little is known about the histology of the liver of reptiles. EOS The aim of the current study was to elucidate the histological architecture of the liver of the Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus). EOS Liver fragments from the Nile monitor were collected in the summer season and processed for the light and electron microscopy. EOS The liver of the Nile monitor was bi-lobed and the right lobe was found to be larger than the left lobe.	Histological examination revealed indistinct lobulation of the liver, and the central vein, sinusoids and portal area were haphazardly organized.
doc	Unimodular gravity theory with external sources in a Lorentz-symmetry breaking scenario EOS This paper is dedicated to the study of interactions between stationary field sources for the linearized unimodular gravity or WTDIFF theory in a model which exhibits Lorentz symmetry breaking due to the presence of the linearized topological Chern-Simons term in _EQN_ dimensions, where the Lorentz symmetry breaking is caused by a single background vector _EQN_. EOS Since the background vector is very tiny, we treat it perturbatively up to second order and we focus on physical phenomena which have no counterpart in standard WTDIFF theory.	We consider effects related to field sources describing point-like particles and cosmic strings.
doc	Annotation Artifacts in Natural Language Inference Data EOS Large-scale datasets for natural language inference are created by presenting crowd workers with a sentence (premise), and asking them to generate three new sentences (hypotheses) that it entails, contradicts, or is logically neutral with respect to. EOS We show that, in a significant portion of such data, this protocol leaves clues that make it possible to identify the label by looking only at the hypothesis, without observing the premise. EOS Specifically, we show that a simple text categorization model can correctly classify the hypothesis alone in about 67% of SNLI (Bowman et. EOS al, 2015) and 53% of MultiNLI (Williams et.	al, 2017).
doc	Upper bound on the number of steps for solving the subset sum problem by the Branch-and-Bound method EOS We study the computational complexity of one of the particular cases of the knapsack problem: the subset sum problem. EOS For solving this problem we consider one of the basic variants of the Branch-and-Bound method in which any sub-problem is decomposed along the free variable with the maximal weight. EOS By the complexity of solving a problem by the Branch-and-Bound method we mean the number of steps required for solving the problem by this method.

doc	Testing Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity with the Effective Field Theory approach EOS We show how to fully map a specific model of modified gravity into the Einstein-Boltzmann solver EFTCAMB. EOS This approach consists in few steps and allows to obtain the cosmological phenomenology of a model with minimal effort. EOS We discuss all these steps, from the solution of the dynamical equations for the cosmological background of the model to the use of the mapping relations to cast the model into the effective field theory language and use the latter to solve for perturbations. EOS We choose the Hu-Sawicki f(R) model of gravity as our working example. EOS After solving the background and performing the mapping, we interface the algorithm with EFTCAMB and take advantage of the effective field theory framework to integrate the full dynamics of linear perturbations, returning all quantities needed to accurately compare the model with observations.	We discuss some observational signatures of this model, focusing on the linear growth of cosmic structures.

doc	Improved constraints on the mixing and mass of _EQN_ bosons from resonant diboson searches at the LHC at _EQN_ TeV and predictions for Run II EOS New neutral vector bosons _EQN_ decaying to charged gauge boson pairs _EQN_ are predicted in many scenarios of new physics, including models with an extended gauge sector such as _EQN_, left-right symmetric _EQN_ and the sequential standard model _EQN_. EOS For these benchmark models we calculate and present theoretical expectations for different values of the _EQN_ mass _EQN_ and mixing parameter _EQN_. EOS Our results are based on the narrow width approximation which allows to make a convenient comparison of experiment to theoretical benchmark models.	The diboson production allows to place stringent constraints on the _EQN_ - _EQN_ mixing angle and the _EQN_ mass, which we determine by using data from _EQN_ collisions at _EQN_ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN LHC, with integrated luminosity of _EQN_ 36 fb _EQN_.
doc	ART: Sub-Logarithmic Decentralized Range Query Processing with Probabilistic Guarantees EOS We focus on range query processing on large-scale, typically distributed infrastructures, such as clouds of thousands of nodes of shared-datacenters, of p2p distributed overlays, etc. EOS In such distributed environments, efficient range query processing is the key for managing the distributed data sets per se, and for monitoring the infrastructure's resources. EOS We wish to develop an architecture that can support range queries in such large-scale decentralized environments and can scale in terms of the number of nodes as well as in terms of the data items stored. EOS Of course, in the last few years there have been a number of solutions (mostly from researchers in the p2p domain) for designing such large-scale systems. EOS However, these are inadequate for our purposes, since at the envisaged scales the classic logarithmic complexity (for point queries) is still too expensive while for range queries it is even more disappointing. EOS In this paper we go one step further and achieve a sub-logarithmic complexity. EOS We contribute the ART, which outperforms the most popular decentralized structures, including Chord (and some of its successors), BATON (and its successor) and Skip-Graphs. EOS We contribute theoretical analysis, backed up by detailed experimental results, showing that the communication cost of query and update operations is _EQN_ hops, where the base _EQN_ is a double-exponentially power of two and _EQN_ is the total number of nodes.

Our experimental performance studies include a detailed performance comparison which showcases the improved performance, scalability, and robustness of ART.
doc	Ac susceptibility behaviour of Ce_2Pd_ 1-x Co_ x Si_3 EOS We report the results of ac susceptibility chi measurements for various compositions of the series, Ce_2Pd_ 1-x Co_xSi_3, in the polycrystalline form, which has been previously reported to undergo a transformation from magnetic ordering to non-magnetic Kondo lattice behavior as x is varied from 0 to 1. EOS A finding of emphasis here is that the features in ac chi data for the compositions, x = 0.6 and 0.7, in the close vicinity of quantum critical point (QCP), are typical of long range magnetic ordering systems, whereas the compositions far away from QCP at the Pd-end including Ce_2PdSi_3 exhibit spin-glass characteristics.	This trend is different from hitherto known behavior among Kondo alloys.
doc	Uniqueness of the fixed point of nonexpansive semidifferentiable maps EOS We consider semidifferentiable (possibly nonsmooth) maps, acting on a subset of a Banach space, that are nonexpansive either in the norm of the space or in the Hilbert's or Thompson's metric inherited from a convex cone. EOS We show that the global uniqueness of the fixed point of the map, as well as the geometric convergence of every orbit to this fixed point, can be inferred from the semidifferential of the map at this point. EOS In particular, we show that the geometric convergence rate of the orbits to the fixed point can be bounded in terms of Bonsall's nonlinear spectral radius of the semidifferential. EOS We derive similar results concerning the uniqueness of the eigenline and the geometric convergence of the orbits to it, in the case of positively homogeneous maps acting on the interior of a cone, or of additively homogeneous maps acting on an AM-space with unit.	This is motivated in particular by the analysis of dynamic programming operators (Shapley operators) of zero-sum stochastic games.

GEMs are gas-filled detectors that have the advantageous decoupling of the charge amplification structure from the charge collection and readout structure.
doc	HADES-IoT: A Practical Host-Based Anomaly Detection System for IoT Devices (Extended Version) EOS Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become ubiquitous and are spread across many application domains including the industry, transportation, healthcare, and households. EOS However, the proliferation of the IoT devices has raised the concerns about their security, especially when observing that many manufacturers focus only on the core functionality of their products due to short time to market and low-cost pressures, while neglecting security aspects.	Moreover, it does not exist any established or standardized method for measuring and ensuring the security of IoT devices.

doc	A Fault-Tolerant Integrated Vehicle Stability Control Using Adaptive Control Allocation EOS The focus of this paper is an integrated, fault-tolerant vehicle supervisory control algorithm for the overall stability of ground vehicles. EOS Vehicle control systems contain many sensors and actuators that can communicate with each other over communication networks. EOS The proposed supervisory control scheme is composed of a high-level controller that creates a virtual control input vector and a low-level control allocator that distributes the virtual control effort among redundant actuators. EOS Virtual control input incorporates the required traction force, yaw, pitch, and roll moment corrections, and the lateral force correction to ensure stability while following a maneuvering reference initiated by the driver. EOS Based on the virtual control input vector, the allocation module determines front steering angle correction, rear steering angle, traction forces at each tire, and active suspension forces. EOS The proposed control framework distinguishes itself from earlier results in the literature by its ability to adapt to failures and uncertainties by updating its parameters online, without the need for fault identification.	The control structure is validated in the simulation environment using a fourteen degree of freedom nonlinear vehicle model.

doc	A few properties of sample variance EOS A basic result is that the sample variance for i.i.d. EOS observations is an unbiased estimator of the variance of the underlying distribution (see for instance Casella and Berger (2002)). EOS But what happens if the observations are neither independent nor identically distributed. EOS What can we say? EOS Can we in particular compute explicitly the first two moments of the sample mean and hence generalize formulae provided in Tukey (1957a), Tukey (1957b) for the first two moments of the sample variance? EOS We also know that the sample mean and variance are independent if they are computed on an i.i.d. EOS normal distribution.	This is one of the underlying assumption to derive the Student distribution Student alias W.
doc	Chemical evolution of the inner 2 degrees of the Milky Way bulge: [alpha/Fe] trends and metallicity gradients EOS The structure, formation, and evolution of the Milky Way bulge is a matter of debate. EOS Important diagnostics for discriminating between bulge models include alpha-abundance trends with metallicity, and spatial abundance and metallicity gradients. EOS Due to the severe optical extinction in the inner Bulge region, only a few detailed investigations have been performed of this region. EOS Here we aim at investigating the inner 2 degrees by observing the [alpha/Fe] element trends versus metallicity, and by trying to derive the metallicity gradient. EOS [alpha/Fe] and metallicities have been determined by spectral synthesis of 2 micron spectra observed with VLT/CRIRES of 28 M-giants, lying along the Southern minor axis at (l,b)=(0,0), (0,-1), and (0,-2). EOS VLT/ISAAC spectra are used to determine the effective temperature of the stars. EOS We present the first connection between the Galactic Center and the Bulge using similar stars, high spectral resolution, and analysis techniques.	The [alpha/Fe] trends in all our 3 fields show a large similarity among each other and with trends further out in the Bulge, with a lack of an [\alpha/Fe] gradient all the way into the centre.
doc	Relativistic Hydrodynamics on Graphic Cards EOS We show how to accelerate relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using graphic cards (graphic processing units, GPUs). EOS These improvements are of highest relevance e.g. EOS to the field of high-energetic nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC where (ideal and dissipative) relativistic hydrodynamics is used to calculate the evolution of hot and dense QCD matter. EOS The results reported here are based on the Sharp And Smooth Transport Algorithm (SHASTA), which is employed in many hydrodynamical models and hybrid simulation packages, e.g.	the Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics model (UrQMD).
doc	Various Ways to Quantify BDMPs EOS A Boolean logic driven Markov process (BDMP) is a dependability analysis model that defines a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). EOS This formalism has high expressive power, yet it remains readable because its graphical representation stays close to standard fault trees. EOS The size of a BDMP is roughly speaking proportional to the size of the system it models, whereas the size of the CTMC specified by this BDMP suffers from exponential growth. EOS Thus quantifying large BDMPs can be a challenging task. EOS The most general method to quantify them is Monte Carlo simulation, but this may be intractable for highly reliable systems. EOS On the other hand, some subcategories of BDMPs can be processed with much more efficient methods. EOS For example, BDMPs without repairs can be translated into dynamic fault trees, a formalism accepted as an input of the STORM model checker, that performs numerical calculations on sparse matrices, or they can be processed with the tool FIGSEQ that explores paths going to a failure state and calculates their probabilities. EOS BDMPs with repairs can be quantified by FIGSEQ (BDMPs capturing quickly and completely repairable behaviors are solved by a different algorithm), and by the I&AB (Initiator and All Barriers) method, recently published and implemented in a prototype version of RISKSPECTRUM PSA. EOS This tool, based exclusively on Boolean representations looks for and quantifies minimal cut sets of the system, i.e., minimal combinations of component failures that induce the loss of the system. EOS This allows a quick quantification of large models with repairable components, standby redundancies and some other types of dependencies between omponents. EOS All these quantification methods have been tried on a benchmark whose definition was published at the MARS 2017 workshop: the model of emergency power supplies of a nuclear power plant.	In this paper, after a recall of the theoretical principles of the various quantification methods, we compare their performances on that benchmark.

doc	Enhancing the Performance of the T-Peel Test for Thin and Flexible Adhered Laminates EOS Symmetrically bonded thin and flexible T-peel specimens, when tested on vertical travel machines, can be subject to significant gravitational loading; EOS with the associated asymmetry and mixed-mode failure during peeling. EOS This can cause erroneously high experimental peel forces to be recorded which leads to uncertainty in estimating interfacial fracture toughness and failure mode.	To overcome these issues, a mechanical test fixture has been designed for use with vertical test machines, that supports the unpeeled portion of the test specimen and suppresses parasitic loads due to gravity from affecting the peel test.

The tip density of states is influenced by the local magnetic field of the vortex, providing for a new probe of the magnetic field at nanometric sizes.

doc	Lattice fermion models with supersymmetry EOS We investigate a family of lattice models with manifest N=2 supersymmetry. EOS The models describe fermions on a 1D lattice, subject to the constraint that no more than k consecutive lattice sites may be occupied. EOS We discuss the special properties arising from the supersymmetry, and present Bethe ansatz solutions of the simplest models.	We display the connections of the k=1 model with the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic XXZ chain at \Delta=-1/2, and the k=2 model with both the su(2|1)-symmetric tJ model in the ferromagnetic regime and the integrable spin-1 XXZ chain at \Delta=-1/\sqrt 2.
doc	Massive Autonomous UAV Path Planning: A Neural Network Based Mean-Field Game Theoretic Approach EOS This paper investigates the autonomous control of massive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for mission-critical applications (e.g., dispatching many UAVs from a source to a destination for firefighting). EOS Achieving their fast travel and low motion energy without inter-UAV collision under wind perturbation is a daunting control task, which incurs huge communication energy for exchanging UAV states in real time. EOS We tackle this problem by exploiting a mean-field game (MFG) theoretic control method that requires the UAV state exchanges only once at the initial source. EOS Afterwards, each UAV can control its acceleration by locally solving two partial differential equations (PDEs), known as the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. EOS This approach, however, brings about huge computation energy for solving the PDEs, particularly under multi-dimensional UAV states. EOS We address this issue by utilizing a machine learning (ML) method where two separate ML models approximate the solutions of the HJB and FPK equations.	These ML models are trained and exploited using an online gradient descent method with low computational complexity.
doc	Estimating Color-Concept Associations from Image Statistics EOS To interpret the meanings of colors in visualizations of categorical information, people must determine how distinct colors correspond to different concepts. EOS This process is easier when assignments between colors and concepts in visualizations match people's expectations, making color palettes semantically interpretable. EOS Efforts have been underway to optimize color palette design for semantic interpretablity, but this requires having good estimates of human color-concept associations. EOS Obtaining these data from humans is costly, which motivates the need for automated methods. EOS We developed and evaluated a new method for automatically estimating color-concept associations in a way that strongly correlates with human ratings. EOS Building on prior studies using Google Images, our approach operates directly on Google Image search results without the need for humans in the loop.	Specifically, we evaluated several methods for extracting raw pixel content of the images in order to best estimate color-concept associations obtained from human ratings.
doc	Torseurs associes a certaines relations algebriques entre polyzetas aux racines de l'unite EOS We describe in this note a torsor structure arising on the affine scheme defined by a system of rationnal algebraic relations between polyzetas at roots of unity (values of hyperlogarithmic functions on a fixed finite group of complex roots of unity). EOS When this group is reduced to 1, we call these numbers the polyzetas. EOS They generalize the values of the Riemann zeta function at odd positive integers and are also called MZVs, multizetas, multiple harmonic series or Euler/Zagier sums.	It is believed that the relations we consider here span all algebraic relations between them.
doc	Synchronization in a semiclassical Kuramoto model EOS Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon occurring in social, biological, and technological systems when the internal rhythms of their constituents are adapted to be in unison as a result of their coupling. EOS This natural tendency towards dynamical consensus has spurred a large body of theoretical and experimental research in recent decades. EOS The Kuramoto model constitutes the most studied and paradigmatic framework in which to study synchronization. EOS In particular, it shows how synchronization appears as a phase transition from a dynamically disordered state at some critical value for the coupling strength between the interacting units. EOS The critical properties of the synchronization transition of this model have been widely studied and many variants of its formulations have been considered to address different physical realizations. EOS However, the Kuramoto model has been studied only within the domain of classical dynamics, thus neglecting its applications for the study of quantum synchronization phenomena. EOS Based on a system-bath approach and within the Feynman path-integral formalism, we derive equations for the Kuramoto model by taking into account the first quantum fluctuations.	We also analyze its critical properties, the main result being the derivation of the value for the synchronization onset.

doc	De-biasing the Lasso: Optimal Sample Size for Gaussian Designs EOS Performing statistical inference in high-dimension is an outstanding challenge. EOS A major source of difficulty is the absence of precise information on the distribution of high-dimensional estimators. EOS Here, we consider linear regression in the high-dimensional regime _EQN_. EOS In this context, we would like to perform inference on a high-dimensional parameters vector _EQN_. EOS Important progress has been achieved in computing confidence intervals for single coordinates _EQN_. EOS A key role in these new methods is played by a certain debiased estimator _EQN_ that is constructed from the Lasso. EOS Earlier work establishes that, under suitable assumptions on the design matrix, the coordinates of _EQN_ are asymptotically Gaussian provided _EQN_ is _EQN_ -sparse with _EQN_. EOS The condition _EQN_ is stronger than the one for consistent estimation, namely _EQN_. EOS We study Gaussian designs with known or unknown population covariance. EOS When the covariance is known, we prove that the debiased estimator is asymptotically Gaussian under the nearly optimal condition _EQN_. EOS Note that earlier work was limited to _EQN_ even for perfectly known covariance. EOS The same conclusion holds if the population covariance is unknown but can be estimated sufficiently well, e.g. EOS under the same sparsity conditions on the inverse covariance as assumed by earlier work.	For intermediate regimes, we describe the trade-off between sparsity in the coefficients and in the inverse covariance of the design.
doc	Thermalization Processes in Interacting Anderson Insulators EOS This paper describes experiments utilizing a unique property of electron-glasses to gain information on the fundamental nature of the interacting Anderson-localized phase. EOS The methodology is based on measuring the energy absorbed by the electronic system from alternating electromagnetic fields as function of their frequency. EOS Experiments on three-dimensional (3D) amorphous indium-oxide films suggest that, in the strongly localized regime, the energy spectrum is discrete and inelastic electron-electron events are strongly suppressed. EOS These results imply that, at low temperatures, electron thermalization and finite conductivity depend on coupling to the phonon bath.	The situation is different for samples nearing the metal-insulator transition;
doc	Multilevel regression with poststratification for the national level Viber/Street poll on the 2020 presidential election in Belarus EOS Independent sociological polls are forbidden in Belarus. EOS Online polls performed without sound scientific rigour do not yield representative results. EOS Yet, both inside and outside Belarus it is of great importance to obtain precise estimates of the ratings of all candidates. EOS These ratings could function as reliable proxies for the election's outcomes. EOS We conduct an independent poll based on the combination of the data collected via Viber and on the streets of Belarus. EOS The Viber and the street data samples consist of almost 45000 and 1150 unique observations respectively. EOS Bayesian regressions with poststratification were build to estimate ratings of the candidates and rates of early voting turnout for the population as a whole and within various focus subgroups.	We show that both the officially announced results of the election and early voting rates are highly improbable.

Two extensions of this model are presented that allow to simulate the demand process.
doc	Null Killing Vector Dimensional Reduction and Galilean Geometrodynamics EOS The solutions of Einstein's equations admitting one non-null Killing vector field are best studied with the projection formalism of Geroch. EOS When the Killing vector is lightlike, the projection onto the orbit space still exists and one expects a covariant theory with degenerate contravariant metric to appear, its geometry is presented here. EOS Despite the complications of indecomposable representations of the local Euclidean subgroup, one obtains an absolute time and a canonical, Galilean and so-called Newtonian, torsionless connection. EOS The quasi-Maxwell field (Kaluza Klein one-form) that appears in the dimensional reduction is a non-separable part of this affine connection, in contrast to the reduction with a non-null Killing vector. EOS One may define the Kaluza Klein scalar (dilaton) together with the absolute time coordinate after having imposed one of the equations of motion in order to prevent the emergence of torsion.	We present a detailed analysis of the dimensional reduction using moving frames, we derive the complete equations of motion and propose an action whose variation gives rise to all but one of them.

doc	A Memory Window Expression to Predict the Scaling Trends and Endurance of FeFETs EOS The commercialization of non-volatile memories based on ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs) has remained elusive due to scaling, retention, and endurance issues. EOS Thus, it is important to develop accurate characterization tools to quantify the scaling and reliability limits of FeFETs. EOS In this work, we propose to exploit an analytical expression for the Memory Window (MW, i.e., the difference between the threshold voltages due to polarization switching) as a tool to: i) identify a universal scaling behavior of MW regardless of the ferroelectric material; EOS ii) predict endurance and explain its weak dependence on writing conditions;	iii) give an alternative explanation for MW being lower than theoretical limits;
doc	Strong experimental guarantees in ultrafast quantum random number generation EOS We describe a methodology and standard of proof for experimental claims of quantum random number generation (QRNG), analogous to well-established methods from precision measurement. EOS For appropriately constructed physical implementations, lower bounds on the quantum contribution to the average min-entropy can be derived from measurements on the QRNG output. EOS Given these bounds, randomness extractors allow generation of nearly perfect " \epsilon -random" bit streams. EOS An analysis of experimental uncertainties then gives experimentally derived confidence levels on the \epsilon randomness of these sequences. EOS We demonstrate the methodology by application to phase-diffusion QRNG, driven by spontaneous emission as a trusted randomness source. EOS All other factors, including classical phase noise, amplitude fluctuations, digitization errors and correlations due to finite detection bandwidth, are treated with paranoid caution, i.e., assuming the worst possible behaviors consistent with observations. EOS A data-constrained numerical optimization of the distribution of untrusted parameters is used to lower bound the average min-entropy. EOS Under this paranoid analysis, the QRNG remains efficient, generating at least 2.3 quantum random bits per symbol with 8-bit digitization and at least 0.83 quantum random bits per symbol with binary digitization, at a confidence level of 0.99993.	The result demonstrates ultrafast QRNG with strong experimental guarantees.
doc	Toward a Theory of Precursors EOS To better understand the possible breakdown of locality in quantum gravitational systems, we pursue the identity of precursors in the context of AdS/CFT. EOS Holography implies a breakdown of standard bulk locality which we expect to occur only at extremely high energy. EOS We consider precursors that encode bulk information causally disconnected from the boundary and whose measurement involves nonlocal bulk processes. EOS We construct a toy model of holography which encapsulates the expected properties of precursors and compare it with previous such discussions. EOS If these precursors can be identified in the gauge theory, they are almost certainly Wilson loops, perhaps with decorations, but the relevant information is encoded in the high-energy sector of the theory and should not be observable by low energy measurements.	This would be in accord with the locality bound, which serves as a criterion for situations where breakdown of bulk locality is expected.
doc	The role of symmetries in adiabatic quantum algorithms EOS Exploiting the similarity between adiabatic quantum algorithms and quantum phase transitions, we argue that second-order transitions -- typically associated with broken or restored symmetries -- should be advantageous in comparison to first-order transitions.

doc	Analysis of putative exoplanetary signatures found in light curves of two sdBV stars observed by Kepler EOS _EQN_. EOS We investigate the validity of the claim that invokes two extreme exoplanetary system candidates around the pulsating B-type subdwarfs KIC 10001893 and KIC 5807616 from the primary _EQN_ field. EOS _EQN_. EOS Our goal was to find characteristics and the source of weak signals that are observed in these subdwarf light curves. EOS _EQN_. EOS To achieve this, we analyzed short- and long-cadence _EQN_ data of the two stars by means of a Fourier transform and compared the results to Fourier transforms of simulated light curves to which we added exoplanetary signals. EOS The long-cadence data of KIC 10001893 were extracted from CCD images of a nearby star, KIC 10001898, using a point spread function reduction technique. EOS _EQN_. EOS It appears that the amplitudes of the Fourier transform signals that were found in the low-frequency region depend on the methods that are used to extract and prepare _EQN_ data. EOS We demonstrate that using a comparison star for space telescope data can significantly reduce artifacts. EOS Our simulations also show that a weak signal of constant amplitude and frequency, added to a stellar light curve, conserves its frequency in Fourier transform amplitude spectra to within 0.03 _EQN_ Hz. EOS _EQN_.	Based on our simulations, we conclude that the two low-frequency Fourier transform signals found in KIC 5807616 are likely the combined frequencies of the lower amplitude pulsating modes of the star.
doc	Warped Conformal Field Theory as Lower Spin Gravity EOS Two dimensional Warped Conformal Field Theories (WCFTs) may represent the simplest examples of field theories without Lorentz invariance that can be described holographically. EOS As such they constitute a natural window into holography in non AdS space-times, including the near horizon geometry of generic extremal black holes. EOS It is shown in this paper that WCFTs posses a type of boost symmetry.	Using this insight, we discuss how to couple these theories to background geometry.
doc	Semi-analytic modeling of the EBL and consequences for extragalactic gamma-ray spectra EOS Attenuation of high-energy gamma rays by pair-production with UV, optical and IR extragalactic background light (EBL) photons provides a link between the history of galaxy formation and high-energy astrophysics. EOS We present results from our latest semi-analytic models (SAMs), which employ the main ingredients thought to be important to galaxy formation and evolution, as well as an improved model for reprocessing of starlight by dust to mid- and far-IR wavelengths. EOS These SAMs are based upon a Lambda-CDM hierarchical structural formation scenario, and are successful in reproducing a large variety of observational constraints such as number counts, luminosity and mass functions, and color bimodality.	Our fiducial model is based upon a WMAP5 cosmology, and treats dust emission using empirical templates.

doc	On the Mass Distribution of the Intra-Cluster Light in Galaxy Groups and Clusters EOS We take advantage of a semi-analytic model with a state-of-art implementation of the formation of the intra-cluster light (ICL) to study the mass distribution of the ICL in galaxy groups and clusters, at different redshifts. EOS We assume the ICL to follow a NFW profile with a different concentration, linked to that of the dark matter by the relation _EQN_, where the parameter _EQN_ is set to reproduce the observed relation between the stellar mass in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and ICL in the innermost 100 kpc and the halo mass (_EQN_), at _EQN_. EOS The model is then tested against several theoretical and observational results, from the present time to _EQN_. EOS Our analysis shows that the fraction of stellar mass in the BCG and ICL within the innermost 100 kpc is an increasing function of redshift, parameter _EQN_, and a decreasing function of the halo mass. EOS The value of _EQN_ required to match the observed _EQN_ is _EQN_ at _EQN_, but there are hints that it might be a function of redshift and halo mass.	This result indicates that the distribution of the ICL is more concentrated than the dark matter one, but less concentrated than previously found by other studies.
doc	Symplectically knotted codimension-zero embeddings of domains in _EQN_ EOS We show that many toric domains _EQN_ in _EQN_ admit symplectic embeddings _EQN_ into dilates of themselves which are knotted in the strong sense that there is no symplectomorphism of the target that takes _EQN_ to _EQN_. EOS For instance _EQN_ can be taken equal to a polydisk _EQN_, or to any convex toric domain that both is contained in _EQN_ and properly contains a ball _EQN_ ;	by contrast a result of McDuff shows that _EQN_ (or indeed any four-dimensional ellipsoid) cannot have this property.

doc	Long-Lived Distributed Relative Localization of Robot Swarms EOS This paper studies the problem of having mobile robots in a multi-robot system maintain an estimate of the relative position and relative orientation of near-by robots in the environment. EOS This problem is studied in the context of large swarms of simple robots which are capable of measuring only the distance to near-by robots. EOS We present two distributed localization algorithms with different trade-offs between their computational complexity and their coordination requirements. EOS The first algorithm does not require the robots to coordinate their motion. EOS It relies on a non-linear least squares based strategy to allow robots to compute the relative pose of near-by robots. EOS The second algorithm borrows tools from distributed computing theory to coordinate which robots must remain stationary and which robots are allowed to move. EOS This coordination allows the robots to use standard trilateration techniques to compute the relative pose of near-by robots.	Both algorithms are analyzed theoretically and validated through simulations.

doc	Quantifying Observational Projection Effects Using Molecular Cloud Simulations EOS The physical properties of molecular clouds are often measured using spectral-line observations, which provide the only probes of the clouds' velocity structure. EOS It is hard, though, to assess whether and to what extent intensity features in position-position-velocity (PPV) space correspond to "real" density structures in position-position-position (PPP) space. EOS In this paper, we create synthetic molecular cloud spectral-line maps of simulated molecular clouds, and present a new technique for measuring the reality of individual PPV structures. EOS Our procedure projects density structures identified in PPP space into corresponding intensity structures in PPV space and then measures the geometric overlap of the projected structures with structures identified from the synthetic observation. EOS The fractional overlap between a PPP and PPV structure quantifies how well the synthetic observation recovers information about the 3D structure.	Applying this machinery to a set of synthetic observations of CO isotopes, we measure how well spectral-line measurements recover mass, size, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter for a simulated star-forming region.

Our objective is to maximize the communication system throughput by jointly optimizing the subcarrier allocation policy and the trajectory of the UAV, while taking into account the minimum required data rate for each user node, no-fly zones (NFZs), the maximum UAV cruising speed, and initial/final UAV locations.

doc	Outage Analysis of Offloading in Heterogeneous Networks: Composite Fading Channels EOS Small cells deployment is one of the most significant long-term strategic policies of the mobile network operators. EOS In heterogeneous networks (HetNets), small cells serve as offloading spots in the radio access network to offload macro users (MUs) and their associated traffic from congested macrocells.	In this paper, we perform analytical analysis and investigate how the radio propagation effects such as multipath and shadowing and small cell base station density affect MUs' offloading to small cell network (SCN).
doc	Open clusters in AurOB2 EOS We study the area around the HII region Sh 2-234, including the young open cluster Stock 8, to investigate the extent and definition of the association Aur OB2 and the possible role of triggering in massive cluster formation.

EOS We took spectroscopy of 33 early-type stars in the area, including the brightest cluster members. EOS We calculate a common distance of _EQN_ kpc for the three open clusters and surrounding association.	We derive an age 4-6 Ma for Stock 8, and do not find a significantly different age for the other clusters or the association.
doc	Unblind Your Apps: Predicting Natural-Language Labels for Mobile GUI Components by Deep Learning EOS According to the World Health Organization(WHO), it is estimated that approximately 1.3 billion people live with some forms of vision impairment globally, of whom 36 million are blind. EOS Due to their disability, engaging these minority into the society is a challenging problem. EOS The recent rise of smart mobile phones provides a new solution by enabling blind users' convenient access to the information and service for understanding the world. EOS Users with vision impairment can adopt the screen reader embedded in the mobile operating systems to read the content of each screen within the app, and use gestures to interact with the phone. EOS However, the prerequisite of using screen readers is that developers have to add natural-language labels to the image-based components when they are developing the app. EOS Unfortunately, more than 77% apps have issues of missing labels, according to our analysis of 10,408 Android apps. EOS Most of these issues are caused by developers' lack of awareness and knowledge in considering the minority. EOS And even if developers want to add the labels to UI components, they may not come up with concise and clear description as most of them are of no visual issues. EOS To overcome these challenges, we develop a deep-learning based model, called LabelDroid, to automatically predict the labels of image-based buttons by learning from large-scale commercial apps in Google Play.	The experimental results show that our model can make accurate predictions and the generated labels are of higher quality than that from real Android developers.
doc	On the self-similarity of line segments in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence EOS The self-similarity of a passive scalar in homogeneous isotropic decaying turbulence is investigated by the method of line segments (M. EOS Gauding et al, Physics of Fluids 27.9 (2015): 095102). EOS The analysis is based on a highly resolved direct numerical simulation of decaying turbulence. EOS The method of line segments is used to perform a decomposition of the scalar field into smaller sub-units based on the extremal points of the scalar along a straight line. EOS These sub-units (the so-called line segments) are parameterized by their length _EQN_ and the difference _EQN_ of the scalar field between the ending points. EOS Line segments can be understood as thin local convective-diffusive structures in which diffusive processes are enhanced by compressive strain. EOS From DNS, it is shown that the marginal distribution function of the length~ _EQN_ assumes complete self-similarity when re-scaled by the mean length _EQN_. EOS The joint statistics of _EQN_ and _EQN_, from which the local gradient _EQN_ can be defined, play an important role in understanding the turbulence mixing and flow structure. EOS Large values of _EQN_ occur at a small but finite length scale. EOS Statistics of _EQN_ are characterized by rare but strong deviations that exceed the standard deviation by more than one order of magnitude.	It is shown that these events break complete self-similarity of line segments, which confirms the standard paradigm of turbulence that intense events (which are known as internal intermittency) are not self-similar.

doc	Scaling K2. II. Assembly of a Fully Automated C5 Planet Candidate Catalog Using EDI-Vetter EOS We present a uniform transiting exoplanet candidate list for Campaign 5 of the K2 mission. EOS This catalog contains 75 planets with 7 multi-planet systems (5 double, 1 triple, and 1 quadruple planet system). EOS Within the range of our search, we find 8 previously undetected candidates with the remaining 66 candidates overlapping 51% of the Kruse et al study that manually vet Campaign 5 candidates. EOS In order to vet our potential transit signals, we introduce the Exoplanet Detection Identification Vetter (EDI-Vetter), which is a fully automated program able to determine if a transit signal should be labeled as a false positive or a planet candidate. EOS This automation allows us to create a statistically uniform catalog, ideal for planet occurrence rate measurements.	When tested, the vetting software is able to ensure our sample is 94.2% reliable against systematic false positives.

doc	The 80 Ms follow-up of the X-ray afterglow of GRB 130427A challenges the standard forward shock model EOS GRB 130427A was the brightest gamma-ray burst detected in the last 30 years. EOS With an equivalent isotropic energy output of _EQN_ erg and redshift _EQN_, it uniquely combined very high energetics with a relative proximity to Earth. EOS As a consequence, its X-ray afterglow has been detected by sensitive X-ray observatories such as XMM-Newton and Chandra for a record-breaking baseline longer than 80 million seconds.	We present the X-ray light-curve of this event over such an interval.
doc	Monobrick, a uniform approach to torsion-free classes and wide subcategories EOS For a length abelian category, we show that all torsion-free classes can be classified by using only the information on bricks, including non functorially-finite ones. EOS The idea is to consider the set of simple objects in a torsion-free class, which has the following property: it is a set of bricks where every non-zero map between them is an injection. EOS We call such a set a monobrick. EOS In this paper, we provide a uniform method to study torsion-free classes and wide subcategories via monobricks. EOS We show that monobricks are in bijection with left Schur subcategories, which contains all subcategories closed under extensions, kernels and images, thus unifies torsion-free classes and wide subcategories. EOS Then we show that torsion-free classes bijectively correspond to cofinally closed monobricks. EOS Using monobricks, we deduce several known results on torsion(-free) classes and wide subcategories (e.g.	finiteness result and bijections) in length abelian categories, without using _EQN_ -tilting theory.
doc	Calibration of the distance scale from galactic Cepheids:II Use of the HIPPARCOS calibration EOS New estimate of the distances of 36 nearby galaxies is presented. EOS It is based on the calibration of the V- and I-band Period-Lumi- nosity relations for galactic Cepheids measured by the HIPPARCOS mission. EOS The distance moduli are obtained in a classical way. EOS The statistical bias due to the incompleteness of the sample is corrected according to the precepts introduced by Teerikorpi (1987). EOS We adopt a constant slope (the one obtained with LMC Cepheids). EOS The correction for incompleteness bias introduce an uncertainty which depends on each galaxy. EOS On the mean, this uncertainty is small (0.04 mag) but it may reach 0.3 mag. EOS We show that the un- certainty due to the correction of the extinction is small (propably less than 0.05 mag.). EOS The correlation between the metallicity and the morphological type of the host galaxy sug- gests us to reduce the application to spiral galaxies in order to bypass the problem of metallicity. EOS We suspect that the adopted PL slopes are not valid for all morphological types of galaxies.	This may induce a mean systematic shift of 0.1 mag on distance moduli.

doc	Following the ground-states of full-RSB spherical spin glasses EOS We focus on spherical spin glasses whose Parisi distribution has support of the form _EQN_. EOS For such models we construct paths from the origin to the sphere which consistently remain close to the ground-state energy on the sphere of corresponding radius. EOS The construction uses a greedy strategy, which always follows a direction corresponding to the most negative eigenvalues of the Hessian of the Hamiltonian. EOS For finite mixtures _EQN_ it provides an algorithm of time complexity _EQN_ to find w.h.p. EOS points with the ground-state energy, up to a small error. EOS For the pure spherical models, the same algorithm reaches the energy _EQN_, the conjectural terminal energy for gradient descent.	Using the TAP formula for the free energy, for full-RSB models with support _EQN_, we are able to prove the correct lower bound on the free energy (namely, prove the lower bound from Parisi's formula), assuming the correctness of the Parisi formula only in the replica symmetric case.
doc	Investigating Constraint Programming and Hybrid Methods for Real World Industrial Test Laboratory Scheduling EOS In this paper we deal with a complex real world scheduling problem closely related to the well-known Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). EOS The problem concerns industrial test laboratories in which a large number of tests has to be performed by qualified personnel using specialised equipment, while respecting deadlines and other constraints. EOS We present different constraint programming models and search strategies for this problem. EOS Furthermore, we propose a Very Large Neighborhood Search approach based on our CP methods. EOS Our models are evaluated using CP solvers and a MIP solver both on real-world test laboratory data and on a set of generated instances of different sizes based on the real-world data. EOS Further, we compare the exact approaches with VLNS and a Simulated Annealing heuristic.	We could find feasible solutions for all instances and several optimal solutions and we show that using VLNS we can improve upon the results of the other approaches.

doc	Timing analysis techniques at large core distances for multi-TeV gamma ray astronomy EOS We present an analysis technique that uses the timing information of Cherenkov images from extensive air showers (EAS). EOS Our emphasis is on distant, or large core distance gamma-ray induced showers at multi-TeV energies. EOS Specifically, combining pixel timing information with an improved direction reconstruction algorithm, leads to improvements in angular and core resolution as large as ~40% and ~30%, respectively, when compared with the same algorithm without the use of timing. EOS Above 10 TeV, this results in an angular resolution approaching 0.05 degrees, together with a core resolution better than ~15 m. EOS The off-axis post-cut gamma-ray acceptance is energy dependent and its full width at half maximum ranges from 4 degrees to 8 degrees. EOS For shower directions that are up to ~6 degrees off-axis, the angular resolution achieved by using timing information is comparable, around 100 TeV, to the on-axis angular resolution. EOS The telescope specifications and layout we describe here are geared towards energies above 10 TeV.	However, the methods can in principle be applied to other energies, given suitable telescope parameters.

doc	Towards Global Remote Discharge Estimation: Using the Few to Estimate The Many EOS Learning hydrologic models for accurate riverine flood prediction at scale is a challenge of great importance. EOS One of the key difficulties is the need to rely on in-situ river discharge measurements, which can be quite scarce and unreliable, particularly in regions where floods cause the most damage every year. EOS Accordingly, in this work we tackle the problem of river discharge estimation at different river locations. EOS A core characteristic of the data at hand (e.g. EOS satellite measurements) is that we have few measurements for many locations, all sharing the same physics that underlie the water discharge. EOS We capture this scenario in a simple but powerful common mechanism regression (CMR) model with a local component as well as a shared one which captures the global discharge mechanism. EOS The resulting learning objective is non-convex, but we show that we can find its global optimum by leveraging the power of joining local measurements across sites.	In particular, using a spectral initialization with provable near-optimal accuracy, we can find the optimum using standard descent methods.

EOS We study a framework in which, due to such manipulation, data becomes less informative when decisions depend more strongly on data.	We formalize why and how a decisionmaker should commit to underutilizing data.
doc	Microlensing Parallax for Observers in Heliocentric Motion EOS Motivated by the ongoing Spitzer observational campaign, and the forecoming K2 one, we revisit, working in an heliocentric reference frame, the geometrical foundation for the analysis of the microlensing parallax, as measured with the simultaneous observation of the same microlensing event from two observers with relative distance of order AU. EOS For the case of observers at rest we discuss the well known fourfold microlensing parallax degeneracy and determine an equation for the degenerate directions of the lens trajectory.	For the case of observers in motion, we write down an extension of the Gould (1994) relationship between the microlensing parallax and the observable quantities and, at the same time, we highlight the functional dependence of these same quantities from the timescale of the underlying microlensing event.
doc	Likelihood-based semi-supervised model selection with applications to speech processing EOS In conventional supervised pattern recognition tasks, model selection is typically accomplished by minimizing the classification error rate on a set of so-called development data, subject to ground-truth labeling by human experts or some other means. EOS In the context of speech processing systems and other large-scale practical applications, however, such labeled development data are typically costly and difficult to obtain. EOS This article proposes an alternative semi-supervised framework for likelihood-based model selection that leverages unlabeled data by using trained classifiers representing each model to automatically generate putative labels.	The errors that result from this automatic labeling are shown to be amenable to results from robust statistics, which in turn provide for minimax-optimal censored likelihood ratio tests that recover the nonparametric sign test as a limiting case.
doc	Multivariate limit theorems in the context of long-range dependence EOS We study the limit law of a vector made up of normalized sums of functions of long-range dependent stationary Gaussian series. EOS Depending on the memory parameter of the Gaussian series and on the Hermite ranks of the functions, the resulting limit law may be (a) a multivariate Gaussian process involving dependent Brownian motion marginals, or (b) a multivariate process involving dependent Hermite processes as marginals, or (c) a combination.	We treat cases (a), (b) in general and case (c) when the Hermite components involve ranks 1 and 2.
doc	Harnessing elasticity to generate self-oscillation via an electrohydrodynamic instability EOS Under a steady DC electric field of sufficient strength, a weakly conducting dielectric sphere in a dielectric solvent with higher conductivity can undergo spontaneous spinning (Quincke rotation) through a pitchfork bifurcation. EOS We design an object composed of a dielectric sphere and an elastic filament. EOS By solving an elasto-electro-hydrodynamic (EEH) problem numerically, we uncover an EEH instability exhibiting diverse dynamic responses.	Varying the bending stiffness of the filament, the composite object displays three behaviours: a stationary state, undulatory swimming and steady spinning, where the swimming results from a self-oscillatory instability through a Hopf bifurcation.

doc	The Origin and Mechanisms of CP Violation In the Two-Higgs Doublet Model and Masses of the Exotic Scalars EOS I rebuild a conventional two-Higgs doublet model by relaxing the spontaneous CP violation and considering approximate global U(1) family symmetries. EOS So that the domain-wall problem does not explicitly arise at the weak scale, but CP violation still solely originates from a single CP-phase in the vacuum after spontaneous symmetry breaking. EOS With this phase four types of CP-violating mechanism are induced in the model. EOS In particular, by a new type of the mechanism, both the indirect- and direct- CP violation (i.e.	_EQN_ and _EQN_) in kaon decay and the neutron electric dipole moment can be consistently accommodated.
doc	Anyons, Monopole and Coulomb Problem EOS The monopole systems with hidden symmetry of the two-dimensional Coulomb problem are considered. EOS One of them, the "charge-charged magnetic vortex" with a half-spin, is constructed by reducing the quantum circular oscillator with respect to the action of the parity operator. EOS The other two systems are constructed by reduction from the two-dimensional complex space.	The first system is a particle on the sphere in the presence of the exterior constant magnetic field (generated by Dirac's monopole located in its center).

doc	Cosmological Constraints from Weak Lensing Surveys EOS Focusing on the well motivated aperture mass statistics _EQN_, we study the possibility of constraining cosmological parameters using future space based SNAP class weak lensing missions. EOS Using completely analytical results we construct the covariance matrix for estimators based on two-point and three-point statistics. EOS Our approach incorporates an accurate modelling of higher-order statistics to describe cosmic variance as well as various sources of discrete noise at small angular scales. EOS These results are then fed into a Fisher matrix based analysis to study cosmological parameter degeneracies. EOS Joint and independent analysis, with or without redshift binning, for various parameter combinations are presented.	An analytical modelling of the covariance matrix opens up the possibility of testing various approximations which are often used in derivations of semi-analytical results.

EOS Cross-bifix-free codes arise in the study of distributed sequences for frame synchronization. EOS We provide a new construction of cross-bifix-free codes which generalizes the construction in Bajic (2007) to longer code lengths and to any alphabet size. EOS The codes are shown to be nearly optimal in size.	We also establish new results on Fibonacci sequences, that are used in estimating the size of the cross-bifix-free codes.
doc	Orbit Design for Space Atom-Interferometer AIGSO EOS Atom Interferometric Gravitational-wave (GW) Space Observatory (AIGSO) is a mission concept mainly aimed at the middle-frequency (0.1 Hz - 10 Hz) GW detection. EOS AIGSO proposes to have three spacecraft in linear formation with extension of 10 km. EOS The three spacecraft need to maintain 5 km + 5 km constant arm-length formation. EOS In this study, we address the issue of orbit design and thruster requirement. EOS The acceleration to maintain the formation can be designed to be less than 30 pm/s _EQN_ and the thruster requirement is in the 30 nN range.	Application to other arm-length-maintaining missions is also discussed.

EOS The analysis of these events requires working with the full measure-valued process describing the system.	This is the first algorithm that is shown to be asymptotically optimal, in the rare-event simulation context, under the setting of many-server queues involving a full measure-valued descriptor.
doc	Confirmatory Factor Analysis -- A Case study EOS Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is a particular form of factor analysis, most commonly used in social research. EOS In confirmatory factor analysis, the researcher first develops a hypothesis about what factors they believe are underlying the used measures and may impose constraints on the model based on these a priori hypotheses. EOS For example, if two factors are accounting for the covariance in the measures, and these factors are unrelated to one another, we can create a model where the correlation between factor X and factor Y is set to zero. EOS Measures could then be obtained to assess how well the fitted model captured the covariance between all the items or measures in the model. EOS Thus, if the results of statistical tests of the model fit indicate a poor fit, the model will be rejected.	If the fit is weak, it may be due to a variety of reasons.
doc	Domination related parameters in the generalized lexicographic product of graphs EOS In this paper we begin an exploration of several domination-related parameters (among which are the total, restrained, total restrained, paired, outer connected and total outer connected domination numbers) in the generalized lexicographic product (GLP for short) of graphs. EOS We prove that for each GLP of graphs there exist several equality chains containing these parameters. EOS Some known results on standard lexicographic product of two graphs are generalized or/and extended. EOS We also obtain results on well _EQN_ -dominated GLP of graphs, where _EQN_ stands for any of the above mentioned domination parameters.	In particular, we present a characterization of well _EQN_ -dominated GLP of graphs in the cases when _EQN_ is the domination number or the total domination number.

doc	An introduction to reconstructing ancestral genomes EOS Recent advances in high-throughput genomics technologies have resulted in the sequencing of large numbers of (near) complete genomes. EOS These genome sequences are being mined for important functional elements, such as genes. EOS They are also being compared and contrasted in order to identify other functional sequences, such as those involved in the regulation of genes. EOS In cases where DNA sequences from different organisms can be determined to have originated from a common ancestor, it is natural to try to infer the an- cestral sequences.	The reconstruction of ancestral genomes can lead to insights about genome evolution, and the origins and diversity of function.

doc	Large-sample study of the kernel density estimators under multiplicative censoring EOS The multiplicative censoring model introduced in Vardi [Biometrika 76 (1989) 751--761] is an incomplete data problem whereby two independent samples from the lifetime distribution _EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_, are observed subject to a form of coarsening. EOS Specifically, sample _EQN_ is fully observed while _EQN_ is observed instead of _EQN_, where _EQN_ and _EQN_ is an independent sample from the standard uniform distribution. EOS Vardi [Biometrika 76 (1989) 751--761] showed that this model unifies several important statistical problems, such as the deconvolution of an exponential random variable, estimation under a decreasing density constraint and an estimation problem in renewal processes.	In this paper, we establish the large-sample properties of kernel density estimators under the multiplicative censoring model.
doc	Decoupling of Translations from Homogeneous Transformations in Inhomogeneous Quantum Groups EOS We briefly report on our result that, if there exists a realization of a Hopf algebra _EQN_ in a _EQN_ -module algebra _EQN_, then their cross-product is equal to the product of _EQN_ itself with a subalgebra isomorphic to _EQN_ and commuting with _EQN_.

doc	Interplay between spin-density-wave and superconducting states in quasi-one-dimensional conductors EOS The interference between spin-density-wave and superconducting instabilities in quasi-one-dimensional correlated metals is analyzed using the renormalization group method. EOS At the one-loop level, we show how the interference leads to a continuous crossover from a spin-density-wave state to unconventional superconductivity when deviations from perfect nesting of the Fermi surface exceed a critical value. EOS Singlet pairing between electrons on neighboring stacks is found to be the most favorable symmetry for superconductivity.	The consequences of non uniform spin-density-wave pairing on the structure of phase diagram within the crossover region is also discussed.

doc	Migration of Planets Into and Out of Mean Motion Resonances in Protoplanetary Disks: Analytical Theory of Second-Order Resonances EOS Recent observations of Kepler multi-planet systems have revealed a number of systems with planets very close to second-order mean motion resonances (MMRs, with period ratio _EQN_, _EQN_, etc.) We present an analytic study of resonance capture and its stability for planets migrating in gaseous disks. EOS Resonance capture requires slow convergent migration of the planets, with sufficiently large eccentricity damping timescale _EQN_ and small pre-resonance eccentricities. EOS We quantify these requirements and find that they can be satisfied for super-Earths under protoplanetary disk conditions. EOS For planets captured into resonance, an equilibrium state can be reached, in which eccentricity excitation due to resonant planet-planet interaction balances eccentricity damping due to planet-disk interaction. EOS We show that this "captured" equilibrium can be overstable, leading to partial or permanent escape of the planets from the resonance.	In general, the stability of the captured state depends on the inner to outer planet mass ratio _EQN_ and the ratio of the eccentricity damping times.
doc	PhD thesis "Extreme value statistics of strongly correlated systems: fermions, random matrices and random walks" EOS In this thesis, we study three physically relevant models of strongly correlated random variables: trapped fermions, random matrices and random walks. EOS In the first part, we show several exact mappings between the ground state of a trapped Fermi gas and ensembles of random matrix theory.	The Fermi gas is inhomogeneous in the trapping potential and in particular there is a finite edge beyond which its density vanishes.
doc	Dissipative and nonaxisymmetric standard-MRI in Kepler disks EOS Deviations from axial symmetry are necessary to maintain self-sustained MRI-turbulence. EOS We define the parameters region where nonaxisymmetric MRI is excited and study dependence of the unstable modes structure and growth rates on the relevant parameters. EOS We solve numerically the linear eigenvalue problem for global axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric modes of standard-MRI in Keplerian disks with finite diffusion. EOS For small magnetic Prandtl number the microscopic viscosity completely drops out from the analysis so that the stability maps and the growth rates expressed in terms of the magnetic Reynolds number Rm and the Lundquist number S do not depend on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm.	The minimum magnetic field for onset of nonaxisymmetric MRI grows with Rm.
doc	Extending OMNeT++ Towards a Platform for the Design of Future In-Vehicle Network Architectures EOS In-vehicle communication technologies are evolving. EOS While today's cars are equipped with fieldbusses to interconnect the various electronic control units, next generation vehicles have timing and bandwidth requirements that exceed the capacities. EOS In particular Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and automated driving using high bandwidth sensors such as cameras, LIDAR or radar will challenge the in-car network. EOS Automotive Ethernet is the most promising candidate to solve the upcoming challenges. EOS But to design and evaluate new protocols, concepts, and architectures suitable analysis tools are required. EOS Especially in the interim period with architectures using automotive Ethernet and legacy fieldbusses together, careful planning and design is of vital importance. EOS Simulation can provide a good understanding of the expectable network metrics in an early development phase. EOS This paper contributes a workflow as well as the required toolchain to evaluate new real-time Ethernet communication architectures using event based simulation in OMNeT++.	We introduce a domain specific language (DSL) - the Abstract Network Description Language (ANDL) - to describe and configure the simulation and present the required simulation models for real-time Ethernet and fieldbus technologies such as CAN and FlexRay.
doc	ReadsClean: a new approach to error correction of sequencing reads based on alignments clustering EOS Motivation: Next generation methods of DNA sequencing produce relatively high rate of reading errors, which interfere with de novo genome assembly of newly sequenced organisms and particularly affect the quality of SNP detection important for diagnostics of many hereditary diseases. EOS There exists a number of programs developed for correcting errors in NGS reads. EOS Such programs utilize various approaches and are optimized for different specific tasks, but all of them are far from being able to correct all errors, especially in sequencing reads that crossing by repeats and DNA from di/polyploid eukaryotic genomes. EOS Results: This paper describes a novel method of error correction based on clustering of alignments of similar reads. EOS This method is implemented in ReadsClean program, which is designed for cleaning Illumina HiSeq sequencing reads. EOS We compared ReadsClean to other reads cleaning programs recognized to be the best by several publications.	Our sequence assembly tests using actual and simulated sequencing reads show superior results achieved by ReadsClean.
doc	Polarizable Molecular Simulations Reveal How Silicon-containing Functional Groups Govern the Desalination Mechanism in Nanoporous Graphene EOS We report a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of reverse osmosis desalination using nanoporous monolayer graphene passivated by SiH _EQN_ and Si(OH) _EQN_ functional groups. EOS A highly accurate and detailed polarizable molecular mechanics force field model was developed for simulating graphene nanopores of various sizes and geometries. EOS The simulated water fluxes and ion rejection percentages are explained using detailed atomistic mechanisms derived from analysis of the simulation trajectories. EOS Our main findings are: (1) The Si(OH) _EQN_ pores possess superior ion rejection rates due to selective electrostatic repulsion of Cl _EQN_ ions, but Na _EQN_ ions are attracted to the pore and block water transfer. EOS (2) By contrast, the SiH _EQN_ pores operate via a steric mechanism that excludes ions based on the size and flexibility of their hydration layers. EOS (3) In absence of ions, water flux is directly proportional to the solvent accessible area within the pore;	however, simulated fluxes are lower than those inferred from recent experimental work.
doc	Fluctuations of Brownian Motions on GL_N EOS We consider a two parameter family of unitarily invariant diffusion processes on the general linear group _EQN_ of _EQN_ invertible matrices, that includes the standard Brownian motion as well as the usual unitary Brownian motion as special cases. EOS We prove that all such processes have Gaussian fluctuations in high dimension with error of order _EQN_ ; EOS this is in terms of the finite dimensional distributions of the process under a large class of test functions known as trace polynomials. EOS We give an explicit characterization of the covariance of the Gaussian fluctuation field, which can be described in terms of a fixed functional of three freely independent free multiplicative Brownian motions.	These results generalize earlier work of L\'evy and Ma\"ida, and Diaconis and Evans, on unitary groups.

doc	Quantifying nonequlibrium thermodynamic operations in a multi-terminal mesoscopic system EOS We investigate a multi-terminal mesoscopic conductor in the quantum Hall regime, subject to temperature and voltage biases. EOS The device can be considered as a nonequilibrium resource acting on a working substance. EOS We previously showed that cooling and power production can occur in the absence of energy and particle currents from a nonequilibrium resource (calling this an N-demon).	Here we allow energy or particle currents from the nonequilibrium resource, and find that the device seemingly operates at a better efficiency than a Carnot engine.

doc	Untangling the Galaxy I: Local Structure and Star Formation History of the Milky Way EOS Gaia DR2 provides unprecedented precision in measurements of the distance and kinematics of stars in the solar neighborhood.	Through applying unsupervised machine learning on DR2's 5-dimensional dataset (3d position + 2d velocity), we identify a number of clusters, associations, and co-moving groups within 1 kpc and _EQN_ (many of which have not been previously known).
doc	Can NRQCD explain the _EQN_ transition form factor data? EOS Unlike the bewildering situation in the _EQN_ form factor, a widespread view is that perturbative QCD can decently account for the recent \textsc BaBar measurement of _EQN_ transition form factor. EOS The next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) perturbative correction to the _EQN_ form factor, is investigated in the NRQCD factorization framework for the first time. EOS As a byproduct, we obtain by far the most precise order- _EQN_ NRQCD matching coefficient for the _EQN_ process. EOS After including the substantial negative order- _EQN_ correction, the good agreement between NRQCD prediction and the measured _EQN_ form factor is completely ruined over a wide range of momentum transfer squared.	This eminent discrepancy casts some doubts on the applicability of NRQCD approach to hard exclusive reactions involving charmonium.
doc	The Stacked Lyman-Alpha Emission Profile from the Circum-Galactic Medium of z~2 Quasars EOS In the context of the FLASHLIGHT survey, we obtained deep narrow band images of 15 _EQN_ quasars with GMOS on Gemini-South in an effort to measure Ly _EQN_ emission from circum- and inter-galactic gas on scales of hundreds of kpc from the central quasar. EOS We do not detect bright giant Ly _EQN_ nebulae (SB~10 _EQN_ erg s _EQN_ cm _EQN_ arcsec _EQN_ at distances >50 kpc) around any of our sources, although we routinely (_EQN_ %) detect smaller scale <50 kpc Ly _EQN_ emission at this SB level emerging from either the extended narrow emission line regions powered by the quasars or by star-formation in their host galaxies.	We stack our 15 deep images to study the average extended Ly _EQN_ surface brightness profile around _EQN_ quasars, carefully PSF-subtracting the unresolved emission component and paying close attention to sources of systematic error.

EOS We detect the system as a point source with coordinates (J2000) RA = 07:37:51.23, Decl. EOS = -30:39:40.9, making this the first double neutron star system to be detected at X-ray energies.	Only 77 source counts are detected.
doc	Macroscopic Chirality Fluctuations in Heavy Ion Collisions should induce CP forbidden Decays EOS f large fluctuations of quark chirality occur in heavy ion collisions, they result in macroscopic CP-odd "spots" of the so called theta-vacua, with a non-zero _EQN_.

doc	Pseudogap and zero-bias anomaly due to fluctuation suppression of quasiparticle tunneling EOS We study the effect of superconducting fluctuations on the tunnel current-voltage characteristics of disordered superconducting films placed in a perpendicular magnetic field, _EQN_, in the whole _EQN_ - _EQN_ phase diagram outside the superconducting region.	This tunnel-current is experimentally accessible by STM measurements.
doc	Deformation and cluster structures in _EQN_ C studied with configuration mixing using Skyrme interactions EOS We report an investigation of the structure of _EQN_ C nucleus employing a newly developed configuration-mixing method. EOS In the three-dimensional coordinate-space representation, we generate a number of Slater determinants with various correlated structures using the imaginary-time algorithm. EOS We then diagonalize a many-body Hamiltonian with the Skyrme interaction in the space spanned by the Slater determinants with parity and angular momentum projections. EOS Our calculation reasonably describes the ground and excited states of _EQN_ C nucleus, both for shell-model-like and cluster-like states. EOS The excitation energies and transition strengths of the ground-state rotational band are well reproduced. EOS Negative parity excited states, _EQN_, _EQN_, and _EQN_, are also reasonably described.	The second and third _EQN_ states, _EQN_ and _EQN_, appear at around 8.8 MeV and 15 MeV, respectively.
doc	Generalized synchronization of chaos in autonomous systems EOS We extend the concept of generalized synchronization of chaos, a phenomenon that occurs in driven dynamical systems, to the context of autonomous spatiotemporal systems. EOS It means a situation where the chaotic state variables in an autonomous system can be synchronized to each other but not to a coupling function defined from them.	The form of the coupling function is not crucial;
doc	Approximate Integration of streaming data EOS We approximate analytic queries on streaming data with a weighted reservoir sampling. EOS For a stream of tuples of a Datawarehouse we show how to approximate some OLAP queries. EOS For a stream of graph edges from a Social Network, we approximate the communities as the large connected components of the edges in the reservoir. EOS We show that for a model of random graphs which follow a power law degree distribution, the community detection algorithm is a good approximation. EOS Given two streams of graph edges from two Sources, we define the Community Correlation as the fraction of the nodes in communities in both streams. EOS Although we do not store the edges of the streams, we can approximate the Community Correlation and define the Integration of two streams.	We illustrate this approach with Twitter streams, associated with TV programs.

doc	Angular Momentum in Disk Wind Revealed in the Young Star MWC349A EOS Disk winds are thought to play a critical role in star birth. EOS As winds extract excess angular momentum from accretion disks, matter in the disk can be transported inward to the star to fuel mass growth. EOS However, the observational evidence of wind carrying angular momentum has been very limited.	We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations of the young star MWC349A in the H26 _EQN_ and H30 _EQN_ recombination lines.

doc	Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Empowered Downlink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access EOS Power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising technology to exploit the new dimension of the power domain to enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless networks. EOS However, most existing NOMA schemes rely on the strong assumption that users' channel gains are quite different, which may be invalid in practice. EOS To unleash the potential of power-domain NOMA, we will propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered NOMA network to introduce desirable channel gain differences among the users by adjusting the phase shifts at RIS. EOS Our goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors at the base station and the phase-shift matrix at the RIS. EOS To address the highly coupled optimization variables, we present an alternating optimization framework to decompose the non-convex bi-quadratically constrained quadratic problem into two rank-one constrained matrices optimization problems via matrix lifting. EOS At the same time, to accurately detect the feasibility of the non-convex rank-one constraints and improve performance by avoiding early stopping in the alternating optimization procedure, we equivalently represent the rank-one constraint as the difference between nuclear norm and spectral norm. EOS A difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC programs via successive convex relaxation, followed by establishing the convergence of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method.	We further propose an efficient user ordering scheme with closed-form expressions, considering both the channel conditions and users' target data rates.
doc	Slow manifold reduction for plasma science EOS The classical Chapman-Enskog procedure admits a substantial geometrical generalization known as slow manifold reduction. EOS This generalization provides a paradigm for deriving and understanding most reduced models in plasma physics that are based on controlled approximations applied to problems with multiple timescales. EOS In this Review we develop the theory of slow manifold reduction with a plasma physics audience in mind. EOS In particular we illustrate (a) how the slow manifold concept may be used to understand ph breakdown of a reduced model over sufficiently-long time intervals, and (b) how a discrete-time analogue of slow manifold theory provides a useful framework for developing implicit integrators for temporally-stiff plasma models. EOS For readers with more advanced mathematical training we also use slow manifold reduction to explain the phenomenon of inheritance of Hamiltonian structure in dissipation-free reduced plasma models.	Various facets of the theory are illustrated in the context of the Abraham-Lorentz model of a single charged particle experiencing its own radiation drag.
doc	Separation of the Alfv\' e n mode from a turbulent velocity field using wavelets EOS We report the first attempt to mode decomposition of the velocity field using wavelet transforms in the application to the magnetized turbulence analysis. EOS We compare results of the separation with respect to the global and local mean magnetic field for models with a strong and weak external magnetic field. EOS We show, that for models with a strong external magnetic field our results are relatively consistent for both methods.	However, for superAlfv\' e nic turbulence with spatially variable direction of the local mean magnetic field the differences are substantial.
doc	Dependency Recurrent Neural Language Models for Sentence Completion EOS Recent work on language modelling has shifted focus from count-based models to neural models. EOS In these works, the words in each sentence are always considered in a left-to-right order. EOS In this paper we show how we can improve the performance of the recurrent neural network (RNN) language model by incorporating the syntactic dependencies of a sentence, which have the effect of bringing relevant contexts closer to the word being predicted. EOS We evaluate our approach on the Microsoft Research Sentence Completion Challenge and show that the dependency RNN proposed improves over the RNN by about 10 points in accuracy.	Furthermore, we achieve results comparable with the state-of-the-art models on this task.
doc	The Hamiltonian Approach to Yang-Mills (2+1): An Expansion Scheme and Corrections to String Tension EOS We carry out further analysis of the Hamiltonian approach to Yang-Mills theory in 2+1 dimensions which helps to place the calculation of the vacuum wave function and the string tension in the context of a systematic expansion scheme. EOS The solution of the Schrodinger equation is carried out recursively. EOS The computation of correlators is re-expressed in terms of a two-dimensional chiral boson theory. EOS The effective action for this theory is calculated to first order in our expansion scheme and to the fourth order in a kinematic expansion parameter.	The resulting corrections to the string tension are shown to be very small, in the range -0.3% to -2.8%, moving our prediction closer to the recent lattice estimates.
doc	Spin Disorder and Magnetic Anisotropy in Fe3O4 Nanoparticles EOS We have studied the magnetic behavior of dextran-coated magnetite (Fe _EQN_ O _EQN_) nanoparticles with median particle size _EQN_ _EQN_. EOS Magnetization curves and in-field M\"ossbauer spectroscopy measurements showed that the magnetic moment _EQN_ of the particles was much smaller than the bulk material. EOS However, we found no evidence of magnetic irreversibility or non-saturating behavior at high fields, usually associated to spin canting. EOS The values of magnetic anisotropy _EQN_ from different techniques indicate that surface or shape contributions are negligible.	It is proposed that these particles have bulk-like ferrimagnetic structure with ordered A and B sublattices, but nearly compensated magnetic moments.
doc	Comparison of performance of van der Waals-corrected exchange-correlation functionals for interlayer interaction in graphene and hexagonal boron nitride EOS Exchange-correlation functionals with corrections for van der Waals interactions (PBE-D2, PBE-D3, PBE-D3(BJ), PBE-TS, optPBE-vdW and vdW-DF2) are tested for graphene and hexagonal boron nitride, both in the form of bulk and bilayer. EOS The characteristics of the potential energy surface, such as the barrier to relative sliding of the layers and magnitude of corrugation, and physically measurable properties associated with relative in-plane and out-of-plane motion of the layers including the shear modulus and modulus for axial compression, shear mode frequency and frequency of out-of-plane vibrations are considered. EOS The PBE-D3(BJ) functional gives the best results for the stackings of hexagonal boron nitride and graphite that are known to be ground-state from the experimental studies. EOS However, it fails to describe the order of metastable states of boron nitride in energy.	The PBE-D3 and vdW-DF2 functionals, which reproduce this order correctly, are identified as the optimal choice for general studies.
doc	Memory effects and active Brownian diffusion EOS A self-propelled artificial microswimmer is often modeled as a ballistic Brownian particle moving with constant speed aligned along one of its axis, but changing direction due to random collisions with the environment. EOS Similarly to thermal noise, its angular randomization is described as a memoryless stochastic process. EOS Here, we speculate that finite-time correlations in the orientational dynamics can affect the swimmer's diffusivity. EOS To this purpose we propose and solve two alternative models. EOS In the first one we simply assume that the environmental fluctuations governing the swimmer's propulsion are exponentially correlated in time, whereas in the second one we account for possible damped fluctuations of the propulsion velocity around the swimmer's axis. EOS The corresponding swimmer's diffusion constants are predicted to get, respectively, enhanced or suppressed upon increasing the model memory time.	Possible consequences of this effect on the interpretation of the experimental data are discussed.
doc	Effects of Baryon Dissipation on the Dark Matter Virial Scaling Relation EOS We investigate effects of baryon dissipation on the dark matter virial scaling relation between total mass and velocity dispersion and the velocity bias of galaxies in groups and clusters using self-consistent cosmological simulations. EOS We show that the baryon dissipation increases the velocity dispersion of dark matter within the virial radius by 5% - 10%. EOS The effect is mainly driven by the change in density and gravitational potential in inner regions of cluster, and it is larger in lower mass systems where gas cooling and star formation are more efficient.	We also show that the galaxy velocity bias depends on how galaxies are selected.

In this article, we review some of our recent results regarding the application of atom interferometry to inertial measurements using compact, mobile sensors.

Two decay modes of the Z boson are investigated.

doc	Complex Kerr Geometry and Nonstationary Kerr Solutions EOS In the frame of the Kerr-Schild approach, we consider the complex structure of Kerr geometry which is determined by a complex world line of a complex source. EOS The real Kerr geometry is represented as a real slice of this complex structure. EOS The Kerr geometry is generalized to the nonstationary case when the current geometry is determined by a retarded time and is defined by a retarded-time construction via a given complex world line of source. EOS A general exact solution corresponding to arbitrary motion of a spinning source is obtained. EOS The acceleration of the source is accompanied by a lightlike radiation along the principal null congruence.	It generalizes to the rotating case the known Kinnersley class of "photon rocket" solutions.
doc	A non-monotonic constitutive model is not necessary to obtain shear banding phenomena in entangled polymer solutions EOS In 1975 Doi and Edwards predicted that entangled polymer melts and solutions can have a constitutive instability, signified by a decreasing stress for shear rates greater than the inverse of the reptation time. EOS Experiments did not support this, and more sophisticated theories incorporated Marrucci's idea (1996) of removing constraints by advection;	this produced a monotonically increasing stress and thus stable constitutive behavior.
doc	Liquid-gas transitions in steady heat conduction EOS We study liquid-gas transitions of heat conduction systems in contact with two heat baths under constant pressure in the linear response regime. EOS On the basis of local equilibrium thermodynamics, we propose an equality with a global temperature, which determines the volume near the equilibrium liquid-gas transition.	We find that the formation of the liquid-gas interface is accompanied by a discontinuous change in the volume when increasing the mean temperature of the baths.

doc	A Coherent Unsupervised Model for Toponym Resolution EOS Toponym Resolution, the task of assigning a location mention in a document to a geographic referent (i.e., latitude/longitude), plays a pivotal role in analyzing location-aware content. EOS However, the ambiguities of natural language and a huge number of possible interpretations for toponyms constitute insurmountable hurdles for this task. EOS In this paper, we study the problem of toponym resolution with no additional information other than a gazetteer and no training data. EOS We demonstrate that a dearth of large enough annotated data makes supervised methods less capable of generalizing. EOS Our proposed method estimates the geographic scope of documents and leverages the connections between nearby place names as evidence to resolve toponyms. EOS We explore the interactions between multiple interpretations of mentions and the relationships between different toponyms in a document to build a model that finds the most coherent resolution. EOS Our model is evaluated on three news corpora, two from the literature and one collected and annotated by us; EOS then, we compare our methods to the state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised techniques. EOS We also examine three commercial products including Reuters OpenCalais, Yahoo! EOS YQL Placemaker, and Google Cloud Natural Language API.	The evaluation shows that our method outperforms the unsupervised technique as well as Reuters OpenCalais and Google Cloud Natural Language API on all three corpora;
doc	Methods to study event-by-event fluctuations in the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS EOS Theoretical calculations locate the critical point of strongly interacting matter (CP) at energies accessible at the CERN SPS. EOS Event-by-event transverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations are considered as one of the most important tools to search for the CP. EOS Pilot studies of the energy dependence and the system size dependence of both _EQN_ and multiplicity fluctuations were performed by the NA49 experiment.	The NA61/SHINE ion program is a continuation of these efforts.
doc	High energy emission of GRB 130427A: evidence for inverse Compton radiation EOS A nearby super-luminous burst GRB 130427A was simultaneously detected by six _EQN_ -ray space telescopes (Swift, Fermi-GBM/LAT, Konus-Wind, SPI-ACS/INTEGRAL, AGILE and RHESSI) and by three RAPTOR full-sky persistent monitors. EOS The isotropic _EQN_ ray energy release is of _EQN_ erg, rendering it the most powerful explosion among the GRBs with a redshift _EQN_. EOS The emission above 100 MeV lasted about one day and four photons are at energies greater than 40 GeV. EOS We show that the count rate of 100 MeV-100 GeV emission may be mainly accounted for by the forward shock synchrotron radiation and the inverse Compton radiation likely dominates at GeV-TeV energies.	In particular, an inverse Compton radiation origin is established for the _EQN_ GeV photons arriving at _EQN_ s after the trigger of Fermi-GBM.
doc	On the Robust superhedging of measurable claims EOS The problem of robust hedging requires to solve the problem of superhedging under a nondominated family of singular measures.

doc	Planetesimal collisions as a chondrule forming event EOS Chondritic meteorites contain unique spherical materials named chondrules: sub-mm sized silicate grains once melted in a high temperature condition in the solar nebula. EOS We numerically explore one of chondrule forming processes, planetesimal collisions. EOS Previous studies found that impact jetting via protoplanet-planetesimal collisions make chondrules with an amount of 1 % of impactors' mass, when impact velocity exceeds 2.5 km s _EQN_. EOS Based on the mineralogical data of chondrules, undifferentiated planetesimals would be more suitable for chondrule-forming collisions than potentially differentiated protoplanets. EOS We examine planetesimal-planetesimal collisions using a shock physics code and find two things: one is that planetesimal-planetesimal collisions produce the nearly same amount of chondrules as protoplanet-planetesimal collisions (_EQN_ 1 %). EOS The other is that the amount of produced chondrules becomes larger as the impact velocity increases when two planetesimals collide with each other.	We also find that progenitors of chondrules can be ejected from deeper regions of large targets (planetesimals or protoplanets) than small impactors (planetesimals).
doc	Robustness of Link-prediction Algorithm Based on Similarity and Application to Biological Networks EOS Many algorithms have been proposed to predict missing links in a variety of real networks.

doc	Galaxy Zoo: The properties of merging galaxies in the nearby Universe - local environments, colours, masses, star-formation rates and AGN activity EOS Following the study of Darg et al (2009; EOS hereafter D09a) we explore the environments, optical colours, stellar masses, star formation and AGN activity in a sample of 3003 pairs of merging galaxies drawn from the SDSS using visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project. EOS While D09a found that the spiral-to-elliptical ratio in (major) mergers appeared higher than that of the global galaxy population, no significant differences are found between the environmental distributions of mergers and a randomly selected control sample. EOS This makes the high occurrence of spirals in mergers unlikely to be an environmental effect and must, therefore, arise from differing time-scales of detectability for spirals and ellipticals. EOS We find that merging galaxies have a wider spread in colour than the global galaxy population, with a significant blue tail resulting from intense star formation in spiral mergers. EOS Galaxies classed as star-forming using their emission-line properties have average star-formation rates approximately doubled by the merger process though star formation is negligibly enhanced in merging elliptical galaxies. EOS We conclude that the internal properties of galaxies significantly affect the time-scales over which merging systems can be detected (as suggested by recent theoretical studies) which leads to spirals being `over-observed' in mergers.	We also suggest that the transition mass _EQN_, noted by REF kauffmann1, below which ellipticals are rare could be linked to disc survival/destruction in mergers.
doc	Some estimates for the stable manifold theorem EOS We investigate the standard stable manifold theorem in the context of a partially hyperbolic singu-larity of a vector field depending on a parameter.	We prove some estimates on the size of the neighbourhood where the local stable manifold is known to be the graph of a function, and some estimates about the derivatives of all orders of this function.
doc	Towards a No-Lose Theorem for NMSSM Higgs Discovery at the LHC EOS We scan the parameter space of the NMSSM for the observability of a Higgs boson at the LHC with _EQN_ integrated luminosity per detector, taking the present LEP constraints into account. EOS We focus on the regions of parameter space for which none of the usually considered LHC detection modes are viable due to the fact that the only light non-singlet (and, therefore, potentially visible) Higgs boson, _EQN_, decays mainly to two CP-odd light Higgs bosons, _EQN_. EOS We simulate the _EQN_ detection mode. EOS We find that this signal may be detectable at the LHC as a signal/background _EQN_ bump in the tail of a rapidly falling mass distribution. EOS If further study gives us confidence that the shape of the background tail is predictable, then we can conclude that NMSSM Higgs detection at the LHC will be possible throughout all of parameter space by combining this signal with the usual detection modes previously simulated by ATLAS and CMS. EOS We also show that this _EQN_ signal will be highly visible at the LC due to its cleaner environment and high luminosity.	We present a study of the production modes and decay channels of interest at the LC.

doc	Atomistic mechanism of perfect alignment of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond EOS Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have attracted a great deal of attention because of their possible use in information processing and electromagnetic sensing technologies. EOS We examined theatomistic generation mechanism for the NV defect aligned in the  direction of C(111) substrates. EOS We found that N is incorporated in the C bilayers during the lateral growth arising from a sequence of kink propagation along the step edge down to [-1,-1,2]. EOS As a result, the atomic configuration with the N-atom lone-pair pointing in the  direction is formed, which causes preferential alignment of NVs.	Our model is consistent with recent experimental data for perfect NV alignment in C(111) substrates.

We have repeated the analysis of the IC's using our own code and the code provided by the authors of astro-ph/0109199, obtaining results that disprove the criticisms.
doc	Controlling Canard Cycles EOS Canard cycles are periodic orbits that appear as special solutions of fast-slow systems (or singularly perturbed Ordinary Differential Equations). EOS It is well known that canard cycles are difficult to detect, hard to reproduce numerically, and that they are sensible to exponentially small changes in parameters.	In this paper we combine techniques from geometric singular perturbation theory, the blow-up method, and control theory, to design controllers that stabilize canard cycles of planar fast-slow systems with a folded critical manifold.

EOS It is shown that if the steady state response is perturbative in the spin-orbit coupling parameter _EQN_, then the precession term--vital for Dyakonov-Perel relaxation and the key to the spin Hall effect in previous similar Boltzmann studies--must be left out to first order in spin-orbit coupling.	In such a case one would have that to lowest order in the parameters electric field, spin-orbit coupling, impurity strength and impurity concentration there is no intrinsic contribution to the spin Hall effect, not only for a Rashba coupling but for a general spin-orbit coupling.

EOS More precisely, if _EQN_ and _EQN_ are _EQN_ weights, and _EQN_ is defined as _EQN_ then the following estimate \[uw\left(\left\ x\in \mathbb R ^n: \frac M_\Phi(fv)(x) v(x) > t\right\ \right) \leq C\int_ \mathbb R ^n \Phi\left(\frac |f(x)|v(x) t \right)u(x) \,dx\] holds for every positive _EQN_. EOS This extends mixed estimates to a wider class of maximal operators, since when we put _EQN_ and _EQN_ we recover a previous result for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator.	This inequality generalizes some previous results proved by Cruz Uribe, Martell and P\'erez in (Int.
doc	Global regularity, and wave breaking phenomena in a class of nonlocal dispersive equations EOS This paper is concerned with a class of nonlocal dispersive models -- the _EQN_ -equation proposed by H. EOS Liu [ On discreteness of the Hopf equation, Acta Math. EOS Appl. EOS Sin. EOS Engl. EOS Ser. EOS 24 (3)(2008)423--440]: _EQN_ including integrable equations such as the Camassa-Holm equation, _EQN_, and the Degasperis-Procesi equation, _EQN_, as special models. EOS We investigate both global regularity of solutions and wave breaking phenomena for _EQN_. EOS It is shown that as _EQN_ increases regularity of solutions improves: (i) _EQN_, the solution will blow up when the momentum of initial data satisfies certain sign conditions; EOS (ii) _EQN_, the solution will blow up when the slope of initial data is negative at one point; EOS (iii) _EQN_ and _EQN_, global existence of strong solutions is ensured. EOS Moreover, if the momentum of initial data has a definite sign, then for any _EQN_ global smoothness of the corresponding solution is proved. EOS Proofs are either based on the use of some global invariants or based on exploration of favorable sign conditions of quantities involving solution derivatives. EOS Existence and uniqueness results of global weak solutions for any _EQN_ are also presented.

doc	Superfluid critical velocity of an elongated harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate EOS We numerically model experiments on the superfluid critical velocity of an elongated, harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate as reported by [P. EOS Engels and C. EOS Atherton, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS 99, 160405 (2007)]. EOS These experiments swept an obstacle formed by an optical dipole potential through the long axis of the condensate at constant velocity. EOS Their results found an increase in the resulting density fluctuations of the condensate above an obstacle velocity of _EQN_ mm/s, suggestive of a superfluid critical velocity substantially less than the average speed of sound.	However, our analysis shows that the that the experimental observations of Engels and Atherton are in fact consistent with a superfluid critical velocity equal to the local speed of sound.
doc	Discrepancies between observational data and theoretical forecast in single field slow roll inflation EOS The PLANCK collaboration has determined values for the spectral parameters of the CMB radiation, namely the spectral index _EQN_, its running _EQN_, the running of the running _EQN_, using a growing body of measurements of CMB anisotropies by the Planck satellite and other missions. EOS These values do not follow the hierarchy of sizes predicted by single field, slow roll inflationary theory, and are thus difficult to fit for such inflation models. EOS In this work we present first a study of 49 single field, slow roll inflationary potentials in which we assess the likelyhood of these models fitting the spectral parameters to their currently most accurate determination given by the PLANCK collaboration. EOS We check numerically with a MATLAB program the spectral parameters that each model can yield for a very broad, comprehensive list of possible parameter and field values. EOS The comparison of spectral parameter values supported by the models with their determinations by the PLANCK collaboration leads to the conclusion that the data provided by PLANCK2015 TT+lowP and PLANCK2015 TT,TE,EE+lowP taking into account the running of the running disfavours 40 of the 49 models with confidence level at least 92.8\%.	Next, we discuss the reliability of the current computations of these spectral parameters.

doc	On the Effectiveness of Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks EOS Unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has proven to be hugely successful. EOS Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier with the sigmoid cross entropy loss function. EOS However, we found that this loss function may lead to the vanishing gradients problem during the learning process. EOS To overcome such a problem, we propose in this paper the Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt the least squares loss for both the discriminator and the generator. EOS We show that minimizing the objective function of LSGAN yields minimizing the Pearson _EQN_ divergence. EOS We also show that the derived objective function that yields minimizing the Pearson _EQN_ divergence performs better than the classical one of using least squares for classification. EOS There are two benefits of LSGANs over regular GANs. EOS First, LSGANs are able to generate higher quality images than regular GANs. EOS Second, LSGANs perform more stably during the learning process. EOS For evaluating the image quality, we conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments, and the experimental results show that LSGANs can generate higher quality images than regular GANs. EOS Furthermore, we evaluate the stability of LSGANs in two groups.	One is to compare between LSGANs and regular GANs without gradient penalty.
doc	Single/Few Bunch Space Charge Effects at 8-GeV in the Fermilab Main Injector EOS For Project X, it is planned to inject a beam of 3x10**11 particles per bunch into the Main Injector. EOS Therefore, at 8-GeV, there will be increased space charge tune shifts and an increased incoherent tune spread. EOS In preparation for these higher intensity bunches exploratory studies have commenced looking at the transmission of different intensity bunches at different tunes. EOS An experiment is described with results for bunch intensities between 20 and 300 10**9 particles. EOS To achieve the highest intensity bunches coalescing at 8-GeV is required, resulting in a longer bunch length.	Comparisons show that similar transmission curves are obtained when the intensity and bunch length have increased by factors of 3.2 and 3.4 respectively, indicating the incoherent tune shifts are similar, as expected from theory.
doc	3D printed beam splitter for polar neutral molecules EOS We describe a macroscopic beam splitter for polar neutral molecules. EOS A complex electrode structure is required for the beam splitter which would be very difficult to produce with traditional manufacturing methods. EOS Instead, we make use of a nascent manufacturing technique: 3D printing of a plastic piece, followed by electroplating. EOS This fabrication method opens a plethora of avenues for research, since 3D printing imposes practically no limitations on possible shapes, and the plating produces chemically robust, conductive construction elements with an almost free choice of surface material; EOS it has the added advantage of dramatically reduced production cost and time.	Our beam splitter is an electrostatic hexapole guide that smoothly transforms into two bent quadrupoles.

doc	A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis of the CMSSM EOS We perform a comprehensive exploration of the Constrained MSSM parameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique and a Bayesian analysis. EOS We compute superpartner masses and other collider observables as well as a cold dark matter abundance, and compare them with experimental data. EOS We include uncertainties arising from theoretical approximations as well as from residual experimental errors on relevant SM parameters. EOS We delineate probability distributions of the CMSSM parameters, the collider and cosmological observables as well as a dark matter direct detection cross section. EOS The 68% probability intervals of the CMSSM parameters are: 0.52 TeV < m_ 1/2 < 1.26 TeV, m_0 <2.10 TeV, -0.34 TeV < A_0 < 2.41 TeV and 38.5< tan(beta) <54.6. EOS Generally, large fractions of high probability ranges of the superpartner masses will be probed at the LHC. EOS We highlight a complementarity between LHC and WIMP dark matter searches in exploring the CMSSM parameter space. EOS We further expose a number of correlations among the observables, in particular between BR(B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-) and BR(\bar B \to X_s\gamma) or sigma_p^ SI. EOS Once SUSY is discovered, this and other correlations may prove helpful in distinguishing the CMSSM from other supersymmetric models.	The robustness of our results is investigated in terms of the assumed ranges of CMSSM parameters and the effect of the (g-2)_mu anomaly which shows some tension with the other observables.

doc	Detecting Colorized Images via Convolutional Neural Networks: Toward High Accuracy and Good Generalization EOS Image colorization achieves more and more realistic results with the increasing computation power of recent deep learning techniques. EOS It becomes more difficult to identify the fake colorized images by human eyes. EOS In this work, we propose a novel forensic method to distinguish between natural images (NIs) and colorized images (CIs) based on convolutional neural network (CNN). EOS Our method is able to achieve high classification accuracy and cope with the challenging scenario of blind detection, i.e., no training sample is available from "unknown" colorization algorithm that we may encounter during the testing phase. EOS This blind detection performance can be regarded as a generalization performance. EOS First, we design and implement a base network, which can attain better performance in terms of classification accuracy and generalization (in most cases) compared with state-of-the-art methods. EOS Furthermore, we design a new branch, which analyzes smaller regions of extracted features, and insert it into the above base network.	Consequently, our network can not only improve the classification accuracy, but also enhance the generalization in the vast majority of cases.
doc	A falling Corona model for the anomalous behavior of the broad emission lines in NGC 5548 EOS NGC 5548 has been intensively monitored by the AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping collaboration. EOS Approximately after half of the light curves, the correlation between the broad emission lines and the lag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. EOS This anomalous behavior is accompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. EOS We propose a simple model to understand this anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby increasing the covering fraction of the inner disk.	Therefore, X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations.

EOS However, _EQN_ -symmetry is broken in the Higgs sector by an explicit and/or effective _EQN_ -term.	This causes a mass splitting between Dirac states in the fermion sector and the neutralinos, which provide the dark matter candidate, become pseudo-Dirac states.

EOS A pair of ultracold spin-polarized _EQN_ helium atoms is excited into a molecular bound state in the purely long range _EQN_ potential connected to the _EQN_ asymptote.	The shift arises from the optical coupling of the molecular excited bound state with the scattering states and the bound states of two colliding _EQN_ atoms.

EOS We analyze its complexity under the assumption that the smooth part of the objective function is partially block separable, and show that the degree of separability directly influences the complexity. EOS This extends the results in [Richtarik, Takac: Parallel coordinate descent methods for big data optimization] to a distributed environment. EOS We first show that partially block separable functions admit an expected separable overapproximation (ESO) with respect to a distributed sampling, compute the ESO parameters, and then specialize complexity results from recent literature that hold under the generic ESO assumption.	We describe several approaches to distribution and synchronization of the computation across a cluster of multi-core computers and provide promising computational results.

doc	SDSS-IV MaNGA: Spatially resolved star formation histories in galaxies as a function of galaxy mass and type EOS We study the internal gradients of stellar population properties within _EQN_ for a representative sample of 721 galaxies with stellar masses ranging between _EQN_ to _EQN_ from the SDSS-IV MaNGA IFU survey. EOS Through the use of our full spectral fitting code FIREFLY, we derive light and mass-weighted stellar population properties and their radial gradients, as well as full star formation and metal enrichment histories. EOS We also quanfify the impact that different stellar population models and full spectral fitting routines have on the derived stellar population properties, and the radial gradient measurements. EOS In our analysis, we find that age gradients tend to be shallow for both early-type and late-type galaxies. EOS Mass-weighted age gradients of early-types are positive (_EQN_) pointing to "outside-in" progression of star formation, while late-type galaxies have negative light-weighted age gradients (_EQN_), suggesting an "inside-out" formation of discs. EOS We detect negative metallicity gradients in both early and late-type galaxies, but these are significantly steeper in late-types, suggesting that radial dependence of chemical enrichment processes and the effect of gas inflow and metal transport are far more pronounced in discs. EOS Metallicity gradients of both morphological classes correlate with galaxy mass, with negative metallicity gradients becoming steeper with increasing galaxy mass. EOS The correlation with mass is stronger for late-type galaxies, with a slope of _EQN_, compared to _EQN_ for early-types.	This result suggests that the merger history plays a relatively small role in shaping metallicity gradients of galaxies.

EOS Hyperon-separation energies of about forty Lambda(_EQN_), three Lambda-Lambda(_EQN_), one Sigma(_EQN_) and seven Cascade(_EQN_) hypernuclei have been experimentally found. EOS Many of these nuclei are of light masses. EOS We prescribe a new mass formula, called BWMH, which describes the normal and hypernuclei on the same footing.

EOS First, it is shown that a purely one-dimensional model can not reproduce the correct order of magnitude of the observed currents. EOS For 2D systems, going beyond first order pertubative calculations, we show that the second harmonic of the current is strongly suppressed in the case of spinless fermion models but significantly enhanced for the Hubbard model. EOS This reduction (resp. EOS increase) of the second harmonic is related to a strong increase (resp.	reduction) of the spacial charge density fluctuations.

EOS We thus develop a novel path integral formulation for the overdamped Langevin equation with the multiplicative noise. EOS The present path integral leads to the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, and naturally gives a normalized transition probability consistently in examples for general stochastic interpretations.	Our result can be applied to study the fluctuation theorems and numerical calculations based on the path integral framework.

doc	DeepSignals: Predicting Intent of Drivers Through Visual Signals EOS Detecting the intention of drivers is an essential task in self-driving, necessary to anticipate sudden events like lane changes and stops. EOS Turn signals and emergency flashers communicate such intentions, providing seconds of potentially critical reaction time.	In this paper, we propose to detect these signals in video sequences by using a deep neural network that reasons about both spatial and temporal information.
doc	Bell Inequalities for Continuously Emitting Sources EOS A common experimental strategy for demonstrating non-classical correlations is to show violation of a Bell inequality by measuring a continuously emitted stream of entangled photon pairs. EOS The measurements involve the detection of photons by two spatially separated parties. EOS The detection times are recorded and compared to quantify the violation. EOS The violation critically depends on determining which detections are coincident. EOS Because the recorded detection times have "jitter", coincidences cannot be inferred perfectly. EOS In the presence of settings-dependent timing errors, this can allow a local-realistic system to show apparent violation--the so-called "coincidence loophole". EOS Here we introduce a family of Bell inequalities based on signed, directed distances between the parties' sequences of recorded timetags. EOS Given that the timetags are recorded for synchronized, fixed observation periods and that the settings choices are random and independent of the source, violation of these inequalities unambiguously shows non-classical correlations violating local realism. EOS Distance-based Bell inequalities are generally useful for two-party configurations where the effective size of the measurement outcome space is large or infinite.	We show how to systematically modify the underlying Bell functions to improve the signal to noise ratio and to quantify the significance of the violation.
doc	The TRAPPIST-1 system: Orbital evolution, tidal dissipation, formation and habitability EOS We study the dynamical evolution of the TRAPPIST-1 system under the influence of orbital circularization through tidal interaction with the central star. EOS We find that systems with parameters close to the observed one evolve into a state where consecutive planets are linked by first order resonances and consecutive triples, apart from planets c, d and e, by connected three body Laplace resonances. EOS The system expands with period ratios increasing and mean eccentricities decreasing with time. EOS This evolution is largely driven by tides acting on the innermost planets which then influence the outer ones. EOS In order that deviations from commensurability become significant only on _EQN_ time scales or longer, we require that the tidal parameter associated with the planets has to be such that _EQN_ At the same time, if we start with two subsystems, with the inner three planets comprising the inner one, _EQN_ associated with the planets has to be on the order (and not significantly exceeding) _EQN_ for the two subsystems to interact and end up in the observed configuration.	This scenario is also supported by modelling of the evolution through disk migration which indicates that the whole system cannot have migrated inwards together.
doc	Explosion Dynamics of Methane Clusters Irradiated by 38 nm XUV Laser Pulses EOS We have studied the explosion dynamics of methane clusters irradiated by intense, femtosecond, 38 nm (32.6 eV) XUV laser pulses. EOS The ion time-of-flight spectrum measured with a Wiley-McLaren-type time-of-flight spectrometer reveals undissociated molecular _EQN_ ions, fragments which are missing hydrogen atoms due to the breakage of one or more C-H bonds _EQN_ and the recombination product _EQN_. EOS Also visible on the time-of-flight traces are atomic and molecular hydrogen ions _EQN_, carbon ions, and larger hydrocarbons such as _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS No doubly-charged parent ions _EQN_ were detected. EOS The time-of-flight results show that total and relative ion yields depend strongly on cluster size. EOS The absolute yields of _EQN_ and _EQN_ scale linearly with the yields of the other generated fragments up to a cluster size of _EQN_, then begin to decrease, whereas the yields of the _EQN_ fragments plateau at this cluster size. EOS The behavior of _EQN_ may be understood through the electron recombination rate, which depends on the electron temperature and the cluster average charge.	Moreover, the _EQN_ behavior is explained by the depletion of both _EQN_ and _EQN_ via electron-ion recombination in the expanding nanoplasma.
doc	Discovery of Quantum Hidden Variable EOS The first clue, in the theory of relativity, the 4-vector force acting on a particle is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle, this orthogonality means that there is some difference between the orthogonality and the usual statement: the Coulomb's force (or gravitational force) acts along the line joining a couple of particles (in usual 3D space), so the direction of 4-vector Coulomb's force is carefully investigated, it is found that Maxwell's equations can be derived from classical Coulomb's force and the orthogonality. EOS The second clue, a 4-vector force has 4 components, because of the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity, the number of independent components of the 4-vector force reduces to 3, however we prove that 4-vector Coulomb's force can merely provide 2 independent components, this situation means that there is an undefined component accompanying the 4-vector Coulomb's force, hinting that this missing undefined component is a hidden variable. EOS The third clue, the best way to study the hidden variable is to establish a new concept: Z-space, in which the undefined component of 4-vector Coulomb's force can be clearly defined as the hidden variable for the quantum mechanics.	At the last, the undefined component is regarded as a fluctuating source that contributes to Lorentz force, so that the quantum wave equation can be derived out in the ensemble space of particle motion from the relativistic Newton's second law.
doc	Associating vectors in _EQN_ with rank 2 projections in _EQN_: with applications	We will see that vectors in _EQN_ have natural analogs as rank 2 projections in _EQN_ and that this association transfers many vector properties into properties of rank two projections on _EQN_.
doc	A covariance equation EOS Let _EQN_ be a commutative semigroup with identity _EQN_ and let _EQN_ be a compact subset in the pointwise convergence topology of the space _EQN_ of all non-zero multiplicative functions on _EQN_ Given a continuous function _EQN_ and a complex regular Borel measure _EQN_ on _EQN_ such that _EQN_ It is shown that _EQN_ for all _EQN_ if and only if for some _EQN_ the support of _EQN_ is contained is contained in _EQN_. EOS Several applications of this characterization are derived. EOS In particular, the reduction of our theorem to the semigroup of non-negative integers _EQN_ solves a problem posed by El Fallah, Klaja, Kellay, Mashregui and Ransford in a more general context.	More consequences of our results are given, some of them illustrate the probabilistic flavor behind the problem studied herein and others establish extremal properties of analytic kernels.
doc	Blue luminous stars in nearby galaxies - UIT005: a possible link to the luminous blue variable stage EOS (abridged) A detailed study of the blue supergiant UIT005 (B2-2.5Ia+) in M33 is presented. EOS The results of our quantitative spectral analysis indicate that the star is a very luminous, log(L/Lsun)~5.9 dex, and massive, M~50 Msun, object, showing a very high nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio in its surface (N/O~8, by mass).	Based on the derived Mg and Si abundances, we argue that this high N/O ratio cannot be the result of an initial low O content due to its location on the disk of M33, known to present a steep metallicity gradient.

The physical quark masses together with the lattice spacing is determined with _EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_ as physical inputs.
doc	Self-reference Upfront: A Study of Self-referential G\"odel Numberings EOS In this paper we examine various requirements on the formalisation choices under which self-reference can be adequately formalised in arithmetic. EOS In particular, we study self-referential numberings, which immediately provide a strong notion of self-reference even for expressively weak languages.	The results of this paper suggest that the question whether truly self-referential reasoning can be formalised in arithmetic is more sensitive to the underlying coding apparatus than usually believed.
doc	Search for time-independent neutrino emission from astrophysical sources with 3 years of IceCube data EOS We present the results of a search for neutrino point sources using the IceCube data collected between April 2008 and May 2011 with three partially completed configurations of the detector: the 40-, 59- and 79-string configurations. EOS The live-time of this data set are 1,040 days. EOS An unbinned maximum likelihood ratio test was used to search for an excess of neutrinos above the atmospheric background at any given direction in the sky.	By adding two more years of data with improved event selection and reconstruction techniques, the sensitivity was improved by a factor 3.5 or more with respect to the previously published results obtained with the 40-string configuration of IceCube.
doc	Non-equilibrium melting of colloidal crystals in confinement EOS We report on a novel and flexible experiment to investigate the non-equilibrium melting behaviour of model crystals made from charged colloidal spheres. EOS In a slit geometry polycrystalline material formed in a low salt region is driven by hydrostatic pressure up an evolving gradient in salt concentration and melts at large salt concentration. EOS Depending on particle and initial salt concentration, driving velocity and the local salt concentration complex morphologic evolution is observed. EOS Crystal-melt interface positions and the melting velocity are obtained quantitatively from time resolved Bragg- and polarization microscopic measurements.	A simple theoretical model predicts the interface to first advance, then for balanced drift and melting velocities to become stationary at a salt concentration larger than the equilibrium melting concentration.

doc	A hybrid setup for fundamental unknowns in neutrino oscillations using T2HK (_EQN_) and _EQN_ -DAR (_EQN_) EOS Neutrino mass hierarchy, CP-violation, and octant of _EQN_ are the fundamental unknowns in neutrino oscillations. EOS In order to address all these three unknowns, we study the physics reach of a setup, where we replace the antineutrino run of T2HK with antineutrinos from muon decay at rest (_EQN_ -DAR). EOS This approach has the advantages of having higher statistics in both neutrino and antineutrino modes, and lower beam-on backgrounds for antineutrino run with reduced systematics. EOS We find that a hybrid setup consisting of T2HK (_EQN_) and _EQN_ -DAR (_EQN_) in conjunction with full exposure from T2K and NO _EQN_ A can resolve the issue of mass hierarchy at greater than 3 _EQN_ C.L. EOS irrespective of the choices of hierarchy, _EQN_, and _EQN_.	This hybrid setup can also establish the CP-violation at 5 _EQN_ C.L.

doc	Resonance peak in underdoped cuprates EOS The magnetic susceptibility measured in neutron scattering experiments in underdoped YBa _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ O _EQN_ is interpreted based on the self-consistent solution of the t-J model of a Cu-O plane. EOS The calculations reproduce correctly the frequency and momentum dependencies of the susceptibility and its variation with doping and temperature in the normal and superconducting states. EOS This allows us to interpret the maximum in the frequency dependence -- the resonance peak -- as a manifestation of the excitation branch of localized Cu spins and to relate the frequency of the maximum to the size of the spin gap. EOS The low-frequency shoulder well resolved in the susceptibility of superconducting crystals is connected with a pronounced maximum in the damping of the spin excitations.	This maximum is caused by intense quasiparticle peaks in the hole spectral function for momenta near the Fermi surface and by the nesting.
doc	Large Nuclear shape transition at finite temperature in a relativistic mean field approach EOS The relativistic Hartree-BCS theory is applied to study the temperature dependence of nuclear shape and pairing gap for _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS For both the nuclei, we find that as temperature increases the pairing gap vanishes leading to phase transition from superfluid to normal phase as is observed in nonrelativistic calculation. EOS The deformation evolves from prolate shapes to spherical shapes at _EQN_ MeV.	Comparison of our results for heat capacity with the ones obtained in the non-relativistic mean field framework indicates that in the relativistic mean field theory the shape transition occurs at a temperature about 0.9 MeV higher and is relatively weaker.

doc	Heavy Fields and Gravity EOS We study the effects of heavy fields on 4D spacetimes with flat, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter asymptotics. EOS At low energies, matter generates specific, calculable higher derivative corrections to the GR action which perturbatively alter the Schwarzschild- _EQN_ family of solutions. EOS The effects of massive scalars, Dirac spinors and gauge fields are each considered. EOS The six-derivative operators they produce, such as _EQN_ terms, generate the leading corrections. EOS The induced changes to horizon radii, Hawking temperatures and entropies are found. EOS Modifications to the energy of large _EQN_ black holes are derived by imposing the first law. EOS An explicit demonstration of the replica trick is provided, as it is used to derive black hole and cosmological horizon entropies. EOS Considering entropy bounds, it's found that scalars and fermions increase the entropy one can store inside a region bounded by a sphere of fixed size, but vectors lead to a decrease, oddly. EOS We also demonstrate, however, that many of the corrections fall below the resolving power of the effective field theory and are therefore untrustworthy.	Defining properties of black holes, such as the horizon area and Hawking temperature, prove to be remarkably robust against higher derivative gravitational corrections.
doc	Local Electron Beam Excitation and Substrate Effect on the Plasmonic Response of Single Gold Nanostars EOS We performed Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy and imaging in a high resolution scanning electron microscope to locally and selectively excite and investigate the plasmonic property of a multibranched gold nanostar on silicon substrate. EOS This method allows us to map the local density of optical states from the nanostar with a spatial resolution down to a few nanometers. EOS We resolve both in spatial and spectral domain, different plasmon modes associated with the nanostar. EOS Finite- difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical simulations are performed to support the experimental observations. EOS We investigate the effect of substrate on the plasmonic property of these complex shaped nanostars.	The powerful CL-FDTD combination helps us to understand the effect of the substrate on plasmonic response of branched nanoparticles.
doc	On Sidorenko's conjecture for determinants and Gaussian Markov random fields EOS We study a class of determinant inequalities that are closely related to Sidorenko's famous conjecture (Also conjectured by Erd\H os and Simonovits in a different form). EOS Our main result can also be interpreted as an entropy inequality for Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF). EOS We call a GMRF on a finite graph _EQN_ homogeneous if the marginal distributions on the edges are all identical. EOS We show that if _EQN_ is bipartite then the differential entropy of any homogeneous GMRF on _EQN_ is at least _EQN_ times the edge entropy plus _EQN_ times the point entropy. EOS We also show that in the case of non-negative correlation on edges, the result holds for an arbitrary graph _EQN_. EOS The connection between Sidorenko's conjecture and GMRF's is established via a large deviation principle on high dimensional spheres combined with graph limit theory.	Connection with Ihara zeta function and the number of spanning trees is also discussed.
doc	On magnetic monopoles, the anomalous g-factor of the electron and the spin-orbit coupling in the Dirac theory EOS We discuss the algebra and the interpretation of the anomalous Zeeman effect and the spin-orbit coupling within the Dirac theory. EOS Whereas the algebra for the anomalous Zeeman effect is impeccable and therefore in excellent agreement with experiment, the physical interpretation of that algebra uses images that are based on macroscopic intuition but do not correspond to the meaning of this algebra. EOS The interpretation violates the Lorentz symmetry. EOS We give an alternative intuitive description of the meaning of this effect, which respects the symmetry and is exact. EOS It can be summarized by stating that a magnetic field makes any charged particle spin. EOS We show also that the traditional discussion about magnetic monopoles confuses two issues, viz. EOS the symmetry of the Maxwell equations and the quantization of charge. EOS These two issues define each a different concept of magnetic monopole. EOS They cannot be merged together into a unique all-encompassing issue. EOS We also generalize the minimal substitution for a charged particle, and provide some intuition for the magnetic vector potential. EOS We finally explore the algebra of the spin-orbit coupling, which turns out to be badly wrong. EOS The traditional theory that is claimed to reproduce the Thomas half is based on a number of errors. EOS An error-free application of the Dirac theory cannot account for the Thomas precession, because it only accounts for the instantaneous local boosts, not for the rotational component of the Lorentz transformation. EOS This runs contrary to established beliefs, but Thomas precession can be understood in terms of the Berry phase on a path through the velocity space of the Lorentz group manifold.	These results clearly reveal the limitations of the prevailing working philosophy to "shut up and calculate".

doc	Cayley-Dicksonia Revisited EOS In the theory of the hypercomplex, the laws governing the algebra are based on units that are naturally associated with an orthogonal vector space, a requirement that is far from mandatory in many algebraic formulations arising in the context of the reals or the complex numbers.In this article the complementing view is held, in that the laws of hypercomplex algebra are recast in terms of quite generally posited units. EOS Proceeding in this manner, a generalized form of the Cayley-Dickson process is examined.	The representations given are regular bimodular;
doc	Statistical estimation and testing via the sorted L1 norm EOS We introduce a novel method for sparse regression and variable selection, which is inspired by modern ideas in multiple testing. EOS Imagine we have observations from the linear model y = X beta + z, then we suggest estimating the regression coefficients by means of a new estimator called SLOPE, which is the solution to minimize 0.5 ||y - Xb\|_2^2 + lambda_1 |b|_(1) + lambda_2 |b|_(2) +... EOS + lambda_p |b|_(p); EOS here, lambda_1 >= \lambda_2 >=... EOS >= \lambda_p >= 0 and |b|_(1) >= |b|_(2) >=... EOS >= |b|_(p) is the order statistic of the magnitudes of b. EOS The regularizer is a sorted L1 norm which penalizes the regression coefficients according to their rank: the higher the rank, the larger the penalty. EOS This is similar to the famous BHq procedure [Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995], which compares the value of a test statistic taken from a family to a critical threshold that depends on its rank in the family. EOS SLOPE is a convex program and we demonstrate an efficient algorithm for computing the solution.	We prove that for orthogonal designs with p variables, taking lambda_i = F^ -1 (1-q_i) (F is the cdf of the errors), q_i = iq/(2p), controls the false discovery rate (FDR) for variable selection.
doc	Rotational dependence of turbulent transport coefficients in global convective dynamo simulations of solar-like stars EOS For moderate and slow rotation, magnetic activity of solar-like stars is observed to strongly depend on rotation. EOS These observations do not yet have a solid explanation in terms of dynamo theory. EOS We aim to find such an explanation by numerically investigated the rotational dependency of dynamo drivers in solar-like stars. EOS We ran semi-global convection simulations of stars with rotation rates from 0 to 30 times the solar value, corresponding to Coriolis numbers, Co, of 0 to 110. EOS We measured the turbulent transport coefficients describing the magnetic field evolution with the help of the test-field method, and compared with the dynamo effect arising from the differential rotation. EOS The trace of the _EQN_ tensor increases for moderate rotation rates with Co _EQN_ and levels off for rapid rotation. EOS This behavior agrees with the kinetic _EQN_, if one considers the decrease of the convective scale with increasing rotation. EOS The _EQN_ tensor becomes highly anisotropic for Co _EQN_. EOS Furthermore, _EQN_ dominates for moderate rotation (1<Co<10), and _EQN_ for rapid rotation (Co _EQN_). EOS The turbulent pumping effect is dominating the meridional transport of the magnetic field. EOS Taking all dynamo effects into account, we find three distinct regimes. EOS For slow rotation, the _EQN_ and R\"adler effects are dominating in the presence of anti-solar differential rotation.	For moderate rotation, _EQN_ and _EQN_ effects are dominant, indicative of _EQN_ or _EQN_ dynamos in operation, producing equatorward-migrating dynamo waves with a qualitatively solar-like rotation profile.
doc	European Option Pricing of electricity under exponential functional of L\'evy processes with Price-Cap principle EOS We propose a new model for electricity pricing based on the price cap principle.

Algorithms that have been proposed are typically centralized and involve multiple graph-theoretic constructions or sampling mechanisms that make them difficult to implement and analyze.
doc	Toward a VLBI resolution of the Pleiades distance controversy EOS The Pleiades is the best studied open cluster in the sky. EOS It is one of the primary open clusters used to define the `zero-age main sequence,' and hence it serves as a cornerstone for programs which use main-sequence fitting to derive distances.	This role is called into question by the `Pleiades distance controversy' - the distance to the Pleiades from Hipparcos of approximately 120 pc is significantly different from the distance of 133 pc derived from other techniques.

In this article we improve the bound given by Gyarmati on family complexity of binary Legendre sequences.

EOS Here we obtain multiband Fermi-surface topology of CeCu _EQN_ Si _EQN_ via first-principles calculations, and study the problem within an effective two hybridization band model including detailed band-structure.	Within T-matrix approximation, our calculations reveal that different pairing candidates could yield qualitatively distinct features characterised by impurity-induced bound states.

doc	An MDL framework for sparse coding and dictionary learning EOS The power of sparse signal modeling with learned over-complete dictionaries has been demonstrated in a variety of applications and fields, from signal processing to statistical inference and machine learning.

As a result, the success of sparse modeling depends on hand-tuning critical parameters for each data and application.

doc	Markov Logic Networks in the Analysis of Genetic Data EOS Complex, non-additive genetic interactions are common and can be critical in determining phenotypes. EOS Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and similar statistical studies of linkage data, however, assume additive models of gene interactions in looking for genotype-phenotype associations. EOS These statistical methods view the compound effects of multiple genes on a phenotype as a sum of partial influences of each individual gene and can often miss a substantial part of the heritable effect. EOS Such methods do not use any biological knowledge about underlying genotype-phenotype mechanisms. EOS Modeling approaches from the AI field that incorporate deterministic knowledge into models to perform statistical analysis can be applied to include prior knowledge in genetic analysis. EOS We chose to use the most general such approach, Markov Logic Networks (MLNs), as a framework for combining deterministic knowledge with statistical analysis. EOS Using simple, logistic regression-type MLNs we have been able to replicate the results of traditional statistical methods. EOS Moreover, we show that even with simple models we are able to go beyond finding independent markers linked to a phenotype by using joint inference that avoids an independence assumption. EOS The method is applied to genetic data on yeast sporulation, a phenotype governed by non-linear gene interactions. EOS In addition to detecting all of the previously identified loci associated with sporulation, our method is able to identify four loci with small effects. EOS Since their effect on sporulation is small, these four loci were not detected with methods that do not account for dependence between markers due to gene interactions.	We show how gene interactions can be detected using more complex models, which can be used as a general framework for incorporating systems biology with genetics.

EOS We use data resampling techniques to thoroughly explore the Bayesian posterior distribution of the extracted functions, and use _EQN_ -means clustering on the parameter samples to identify the configurations that give the best description across all reactions.	Inclusion of the semi-inclusive data reveals a strong suppression of the strange quark distribution at parton momentum fractions _EQN_, in contrast with the ATLAS observation of enhanced strangeness in _EQN_ and _EQN_ production at the LHC.
doc	Sharp changes of solar wind ion flux and density within and outside current sheets EOS Analysis of the Interball-1 spacecraft data (1995-2000) has shown that the solar wind ion flux sometimes increases or decreases abruptly by more than 20% over a time period of several seconds or minutes. EOS Typically, the amplitude of such sharp changes in the solar wind ion flux (SCIFs) is larger than 0.5x10^8 cm^-2 s^-1. EOS These sudden changes of the ion flux were also observed by the Solar Wind Experiment (SWE), on board the WIND spacecraft, as the solar wind density increases and decreases with negligible changes in the solar wind velocity. EOS SCIFs occur irregularly at 1 AU, when plasma flows with specific properties come to the Earth's orbit. EOS SCIFs are usually observed in slow, turbulent solar wind with increased density and interplanetary magnetic field strength. EOS The number of times SCIFs occur during a day is simulated using the solar wind density, magnetic field, and their standard deviations as input parameters for a period of 5 years. EOS A correlation coefficient of ~0.7 is obtained between the modelled and the experimental data. EOS It is found that SCIFs are not associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), corotating interaction regions (CIRs), or interplanetary shocks; EOS however, 85% of the sector boundaries are surrounded by SCIFs.	The properties of the solar wind plasma for days with 5 or more SCIF observations are the same as those of the solar wind plasma at the sector boundaries.
doc	Tempered ultrafunctions EOS Ultrafunctions are a particular class of functions defined on some non- Archimedean field.

doc	Hypergraph Categories EOS Hypergraph categories have been rediscovered at least five times, under various names, including well-supported compact closed categories, dgs-monoidal categories, and dungeon categories. EOS Perhaps the reason they keep being reinvented is two-fold: there are many applications---including to automata, databases, circuits, linear relations, graph rewriting, and belief propagation---and yet the standard definition is so involved and ornate as to be difficult to find in the literature. EOS Indeed, a hypergraph category is, roughly speaking, a "symmetric monoidal category in which each object is equipped with the structure of a special commutative Frobenius monoid, satisfying certain coherence conditions". EOS Fortunately, this description can be simplified a great deal: a hypergraph category is simply a "cospan-algebra". EOS The goal of this paper is to remove the scare-quotes and make the previous statement precise.	We prove two main theorems.

EOS The synoptic wideband orbiting radio detector (SWORD) mission's high event statistics at these energies combined with the pointing capabilities of a space-borne antenna array could enable charged particle astronomy.	The detector concept is based on ANITA's successful detection UHECRs where the geosynchrotron radio signal produced by the extended air shower is reflected off the Earth's surface and detected in flight.

doc	The AKARI FU-HYU galaxy evolution program: First results from the GOODS-N field EOS The AKARI FU-HYU mission program carried out mid-infrared imaging of several well studied Spitzer fields preferentially selecting fields already rich in multi-wavelength data from radio to X-ray wavelengths filling in the wavelength desert between the Spitzer IRAC and MIPS bands.We present the initial results for the FU-HYU survey in the GOODS-N field.We utilize the supreme multiwavelength coverage in the GOODS-N field to produce a multiwavelength catalogue from infrared to ultraviolet wavelengths, containing more than 4393 sources, including photometric redshifts. EOS Using the FU-HYU catalogue we present colour-colour diagrams that map the passage of PAH features through our observation bands.	We find that the longer mid-infrared bands from AKARI (IRC-L18W 18 micron band) and Spitzer (MIPS24 24 micron band) provide an accurate measure of the total MIR emission of the sources and therefore their probable total mid-infrared luminosity.

doc	Towards Methods for Model-Based Software Development EOS Software engineering is a young discipline. EOS Despite efforts in recent years, some elements still require further development, research, and systematization. EOS One of these elements are methods. EOS They consist of a set of well-defined activities used in a software development to guide how the work should be performed to achieve the expected results. EOS However, there is a lack of systematic knowledge that effectively guide how work should be done in a variety of areas. EOS Despite the knowledge available in Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), only the classical methods are comprised there, while emerging topics such as Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE), Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD), and Model-Based Software Development (MBSE) are only briefly mentioned.	We claim that it is also necessary to investigate methods for those emerging software engineering subtracks.
doc	Control variate selection for Monte Carlo integration EOS Monte Carlo integration with variance reduction by means of control variates can be implemented by the ordinary least squares estimator for the intercept in a multiple linear regression model with the integrand as response and the control variates as covariates. EOS Even without special knowledge on the integrand, significant efficiency gains can be obtained if the control variate space is sufficiently large. EOS Incorporating a large number of control variates in the ordinary least squares procedure may however result in (i) a certain instability of the ordinary least squares estimator and (ii) a possibly prohibitive computation time. EOS Regularizing the ordinary least squares estimator by preselecting appropriate control variates via the Lasso turns out to increase the accuracy without additional computational cost.	The findings in the numerical experiment are confirmed by concentration inequalities for the integration error.

EOS In the cases considered the normalized Lommel and Struve functions are _EQN_ uniformly convex functions of order _EQN_ on the determined disks.	The basic tool of this study is Lommel and Struve functions in series.
doc	On Heterotic Orbifolds, M Theory and Type I' Brane Engineering EOS Horava--Witten M theory -- heterotic string duality poses special problems for the twisted sectors of heterotic orbifolds. EOS In  we explained how in M theory the twisted states couple to gauge fields apparently living on M9 branes at both ends of the eleventh dimension at the same time. EOS The resolution involves 7D gauge fields which live on fixed planes of the (T^4/Z_N) x (S^1/Z_2) x R^ 5,1 orbifold and lock onto the 10D gauge fields along the intersection planes. EOS The physics of such intersection planes does not follow directly from the M theory but there are stringent kinematic constraints due to duality and local consistency, which allowed us to deduce the local fields and the boundary conditions at each intersection. EOS In this paper we explain various phenomena at the intersection planes in terms of duality between HW and type I' superstring theories. EOS The orbifold fixed planes are dual to stacks of D6 branes, the M9 planes are dual to O8 orientifold planes accompanied by D8 branes, and the intersections are dual to brane junctions. EOS We engineer several junction types which lead to distinct patterns of 7D/10D gauge field locking, 7D symmetry breaking and/or local 6D fields.	Another aspect of brane engineering is putting the junctions together;

doc	Pressure-induced superconductivity in topological semimetal NbAs2 EOS Topological superconductivity with Majorana bound states, which are critical to implement nonabelian quantum computation, may be realized in three-dimensional semimetals with nontrivial topological feature, when superconducting transition occurs in the bulk. EOS Here, we report pressure-induced superconductivity in a transition-metal dipnictide NbAs2. EOS The emergence of superconductivity is not accompanied by any structural phase transition up to the maximum experimental pressure of 29.8 GPa, as supported by pressure-dependent synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. EOS Intriguingly, the Raman study reveals rapid phonon mode hardening and broadening above 10 GPa, in coincident with the superconducting transition. EOS Using first principle calculations, we determine Fermi surface change induced by pressure, which steadily increases the density of states without breaking the electron-hole compensation.	Noticeably, the main hole pocket of NbAs2 encloses one time-reversal-invariant momenta of the monoclinic lattice, suggesting NbAs2 as a candidate of topological superconductors.
doc	Bridging Mode Connectivity in Loss Landscapes and Adversarial Robustness EOS Mode connectivity provides novel geometric insights on analyzing loss landscapes and enables building high-accuracy pathways between well-trained neural networks. EOS In this work, we propose to employ mode connectivity in loss landscapes to study the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks, and provide novel methods for improving this robustness. EOS Our experiments cover various types of adversarial attacks applied to different network architectures and datasets. EOS When network models are tampered with backdoor or error-injection attacks, our results demonstrate that the path connection learned using limited amount of bonafide data can effectively mitigate adversarial effects while maintaining the original accuracy on clean data. EOS Therefore, mode connectivity provides users with the power to repair backdoored or error-injected models. EOS We also use mode connectivity to investigate the loss landscapes of regular and robust models against evasion attacks.	Experiments show that there exists a barrier in adversarial robustness loss on the path connecting regular and adversarially-trained models.

EOS An X-ray stacking analysis of 23 candidates in the central CDF-S region using the 4 Ms Chandra data reveals a hard X-ray signal with an effective power-law photon index of Gamma=0.6_ -0.4 ^ +0.3, indicating a significant contribution from obscured AGNs. EOS Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that 74+-25% of the selected galaxies host obscured AGNs, within which ~95% are heavily obscured and ~80% are Compton-thick (CT; EOS NH>1.5x10^ 24 cm^ -2).	The heavily obscured objects in our sample are of moderate intrinsic X-ray luminosity [ ~ (0.9-4)x10^ 42 erg/s in the 2-10 keV band].

The buses are driven in a preferred direction and are slowed down by the presence of passengers who arrive with rate lambda.
doc	The Future of Search and Discovery in Big Data Analytics: Ultrametric Information Spaces EOS Consider observation data, comprised of n observation vectors with values on a set of attributes. EOS This gives us n points in attribute space. EOS Having data structured as a tree, implied by having our observations embedded in an ultrametric topology, offers great advantage for proximity searching. EOS If we have preprocessed data through such an embedding, then an observation's nearest neighbor is found in constant computational time, i.e. EOS O(1) time. EOS A further powerful approach is discussed in this work: the inducing of a hierarchy, and hence a tree, in linear computational time, i.e.	O(n) time for n observations.
doc	Unparticle-Higgs Mixing: MSW Resonances, See-saw Mechanism and Spinodal Instabilities EOS Motivated by slow-roll inflationary cosmology we study a scalar unparticle weakly coupled to a Higgs field in the broken symmetry phase. EOS The mixing between the unparticle and the Higgs field results in a seesaw type matrix and the mixing angles feature a Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect as a consequence of the unparticle field being noncanonical. EOS We find two (MSW) resonances for small and large spacelike momenta. EOS The unparticlelike mode features a nearly flat potential with spinodal instabilities and a large expectation value.	An effective potential for the unparticlelike field is generated from the Higgs potential, but with couplings suppressed by a large power of the small seesaw ratio.

doc	Klein-Gordon and Dirac particles in non-constant scalar-curvature background EOS The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are considered in a semi-infinite lab (_EQN_) in the presence of background metrics _EQN_ and _EQN_ with _EQN_. EOS These metrics have non-constant scalar-curvatures. EOS Various aspects of the solutions are studied. EOS For the first metric with _EQN_, it is shown that the spectrums are discrete, with the ground state energy _EQN_ for spin-0 particles. EOS For _EQN_, the spectrums are found to be continuous. EOS For the second metric with _EQN_, each particle, depends on its transverse-momentum, can have continuous or discrete spectrum. EOS For Klein-Gordon particles, this threshold transverse-momentum is _EQN_, while for Dirac particles it is _EQN_. EOS There is no solution for _EQN_ case.	Some geometrical properties of these metrics are also discussed.

EOS The emphasis is on the representation-theoretic aspect.	For nilpotent Lie groups, the connection is made with a scalar quantization of the cotangent bundle _EQN_ and with a Quantum Mechanical theory of observables in the presence of variable magnetic fields.
doc	Variational study of mass generation and deconfinement in Yang-Mills theory EOS A very simple variational approach to pure SU(_EQN_) Yang-Mills theory is proposed, based on the Gaussian effective potential in a linear covariant gauge. EOS The method provides an analytical variational argument for mass generation. EOS The method can be improved order by order by a perturbative massive expansion around the optimal trial vacuum. EOS At finite temperature, a weak first-order transition is found (at _EQN_ MeV for _EQN_) where the mass scale drops discontinuously.	Above the transition the optimal mass increases linearly as expected for deconfined bosons.

doc	Spatially Varying X-ray Synchrotron Emission in SN 1006 EOS A growing number of both galactic and extragalactic supernova remnants show non-thermal (non-plerionic) emission in the X-ray band. EOS New synchrotron models, realized as SRESC and SRCUT in XSPEC 11, which use the radio spectral index and flux as inputs and include the full single-particle emissivity, have demonstrated that synchrotron emission is capable of producing the spectra of dominantly non-thermal supernova remnants with interesting consequences for residual thermal abundances and acceleration of particles. EOS In addition, these models deliver a much better-constrained separation between the thermal and non-thermal components, whereas combining an unconstrained powerlaw with modern thermal models can produce a range of acceptable fits. EOS While synchrotron emission can be approximated by a powerlaw over small ranges of energy, the synchrotron spectrum is in fact steepening over the X-ray band. EOS Having demonstrated that the integrated spectrum of SN 1006, a remnant dominated by non-thermal emission, is well described by synchrotron models I now turn to spatially resolved observations of this well studied remnant.	The synchrotron models make both spectral and spatial predictions, describing how the non-thermal emission varies across the remnant.

The theory predicts scaling instability of the buckling load due to imperfections of load.
doc	Electric-Dipole Effect of Defects on Energy Band Alignment of Rutile and Anatase TiO2 EOS Titanium dioxide materials have been studied intensively and extensively due to photocatalytic applications. EOS A long-standing open question is the energy band alignment of rutile and anatase TiO2 phases, which can affect the photocatalytic process in the composite system. EOS There are basically two contradictory viewpoints about the alignment of these two TiO2 phases supported by respective experiments: 1) straddling type and 2) staggered type. EOS In this work, our DFT plus U calculations find that the perfect rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces have the straddling type band alignment, whereas the surfaces with defects can turn the band alignment into the staggered type.	The electric dipoles induced by defects are responsible for the reversal of band alignment.

EOS In our contribution to the Challenge, we focus on the Elderly Emotion and the Mask sub-challenges. EOS Besides utilizing standard or close-to-standard features such as ComParE functionals, Bag-of-Audio-Words and Fisher vectors, we exploit that emotion is related to the velocity of speech (i.e. EOS speech rate). EOS To utilize this, we perform phone-level recognition using an ASR system, and extract features from the output such as articulation tempo, speech tempo, and various attributes measuring the amount of pauses.	We also hypothesize that wearing a surgical mask makes the speaker feel uneasy, leading to a slower speech rate and more hesitations;
doc	Detecting Dependencies in Sparse, Multivariate Databases Using Probabilistic Programming and Non-parametric Bayes EOS Datasets with hundreds of variables and many missing values are commonplace. EOS In this setting, it is both statistically and computationally challenging to detect true predictive relationships between variables and also to suppress false positives. EOS This paper proposes an approach that combines probabilistic programming, information theory, and non-parametric Bayes. EOS It shows how to use Bayesian non-parametric modeling to (i) build an ensemble of joint probability models for all the variables; EOS (ii) efficiently detect marginal independencies;	and (iii) estimate the conditional mutual information between arbitrary subsets of variables, subject to a broad class of constraints.

doc	Dynamic Partial Sufficient Dimension Reduction EOS Sufficient dimension reduction aims for reduction of dimensionality of a regression without loss of information by replacing the original predictor with its lower-dimensional subspace. EOS Partial (sufficient) dimension reduction arises when the predictors naturally fall into two sets, X and W, and we seek dimension reduction on X alone while considering all predictors in the regression analysis.	Though partial dimension reduction is a very general problem, only very few research results are available when W is continuous.
doc	The Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence, Higgs pairs and surface group representations EOS We develop a complete Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence for twisted pairs on a compact Riemann surface X.

Our results allow us to establish rigorously the homemomorphism between the moduli space of polystable G-Higgs bundles on X and the character variety for representations of the fundamental group of X in G.

doc	Predicting the growth rate of helium bubbles in metal tritide EOS Helium bubbles nucleation and growth in metals or metal tritide is a long-standing problem attracting considerable attention in nuclear industry but the mechanism remains indistinct and predicting the growth rate of helium bubble is inexistence still up to new. EOS Here, the rate of helium bubbles nucleation and growth in metal tritide is developed based on a dynamical model, which describes the diameter of helium bubbles increasing linearly as t**(1/3) in titanium tritide at room temperature, agreeing quite well with the experimental phenomenon. EOS The way of reducing storage temperature from 300 to 225 K or increasing the helium atoms diffusion barrier from 0.81 to 1.1 eV can effectively restrain bubbles growth and prolong lifetime of titanium tritide more than 4 times, which provides a useful reference to relevant experiment exploration and applications.	This model also can be used to predict lifetime of new tritium-storage materials and plasma facing materials in nuclear industry.

However, the variational method proposed allows to study many other problems like dislocation core regularisation, role of elastic anharmonicity and dislocation--solute atom interaction.
doc	Trajectory and distribution of suspended non-Brownian particles moving past a fixed spherical or cylindrical obstacle EOS We investigate the motion of a suspended non-Brownian sphere past a fixed cylindrical or spherical obstacle in the limit of zero Reynolds number for arbitrary particle-obstacle aspect ratios. EOS We consider both a suspended sphere moving in a quiescent fluid under the action of a uniform force as well as a uniform ambient velocity field driving a freely suspended particle. EOS We determine the distribution of particles around a single obstacle and solve for the individual particle trajectories to comment on the transport of dilute suspensions past an array of fixed obstacles. EOS First, we obtain an expression for the probability density function governing the distribution of a dilute suspension of particles around an isolated obstacle, and we show that it is isotropic. EOS We then present an analytical expression -- derived using both Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches -- for the minimum particle-obstacle separation attained during the motion, as a function of the incoming impact parameter, i.e. EOS the initial offset between the line of motion far from the obstacle and the coordinate axis parallel to the driving field. EOS Further, we derive the asymptotic behaviour for small initial offsets and show that the minimum separation decays exponentially.	Finally we use this analytical expression to define an effective hydrodynamic surface roughness based on the net lateral displacement experienced by a suspended sphere moving past an obstacle.

In both cases we find the degeneracy is in accord with expectation.

Since four-dimensional N=2 gauge theories can be engineered by non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds, this implies that it is possible to obtain exact gauge theory Kahler potentials from two-sphere partition functions.
doc	The Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey EOS Until now, investigating the early stages of galaxy formation has been primarily the realm of theoretical modeling and computer simulations, which require many physical ingredients and are challenging to test observationally. EOS However, the latest Hubble Space Telescope observations in the near infrared are shedding new light on the properties of galaxies within the first billion years after the Big Bang, including our recent discovery of the most distant proto-cluster of galaxies at redshift z~8. EOS Here, I compare predictions from models of primordial and metal-enriched star formation during the dark ages with the latest Hubble observations of galaxies during the epoch of reionization. EOS I focus in particular on the luminosity function and on galaxy clustering as measured from our Hubble Space Telescope Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) survey.	BoRG has the largest area coverage to find luminous and rare z~8 sources that are among the first galaxies to have formed in the Universe.

doc	Coded Caching for Heterogeneous Systems: An Optimization Perspective EOS In cache-aided networks, the server populates the cache memories at the users during low-traffic periods, in order to reduce the delivery load during peak-traffic hours. EOS In turn, there exists a fundamental trade-off between the delivery load on the server and the cache sizes at the users.	In this paper, we study this trade-off in a multicast network where the server is connected to users with unequal cache sizes and the number of users is less than or equal to the number of library files.
doc	Crowdsourcing accurately and robustly predicts Supreme Court decisions EOS Scholars have increasingly investigated "crowdsourcing" as an alternative to expert-based judgment or purely data-driven approaches to predicting the future. EOS Under certain conditions, scholars have found that crowdsourcing can outperform these other approaches. EOS However, despite interest in the topic and a series of successful use cases, relatively few studies have applied empirical model thinking to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of crowdsourcing in real-world contexts. EOS In this paper, we offer three novel contributions. EOS First, we explore a dataset of over 600,000 predictions from over 7,000 participants in a multi-year tournament to predict the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. EOS Second, we develop a comprehensive crowd construction framework that allows for the formal description and application of crowdsourcing to real-world data. EOS Third, we apply this framework to our data to construct more than 275,000 crowd models. EOS We find that in out-of-sample historical simulations, crowdsourcing robustly outperforms the commonly-accepted null model, yielding the highest-known performance for this context at 80.8% case level accuracy.	To our knowledge, this dataset and analysis represent one of the largest explorations of recurring human prediction to date, and our results provide additional empirical support for the use of crowdsourcing as a prediction method.

EOS Here we present a classification method by Artificial Neural Networks. EOS We also show results from a comparative study we carried out using a new sample of 830 APM digitised galaxy images. EOS These galaxy images were classified by 6 experts independently. EOS It is shown that the ANNs can replicate the classification by a human expert almost to the same degree of agreement as that between two human experts, to within 2 _EQN_ -type units. EOS Similar methods can be applied to automatic classification of galaxy spectra.	We illustrate it by Principal Component Analysis of galaxy spectra, and discuss future large surveys.

EOS 22 ULX were detected, i.e. EOS with L_x > 1 x 10^ 39 erg s^ -1 (L_10), and 39 other sources were detected with L_x > 5 x 10^ 38 erg s^ -1 (L_5). EOS We also use radial intensity profiles to remove extended sources from the sample. EOS The majority of sources are not extended, which for a typical distance constrains the emission region size to less than 50 pc. EOS X-ray colour-colour diagrams and spectral fitting results were examined for indicators of the ULX nature. EOS In the case of the brighter sources, spectral fitting generally requires two-component models.	In only a few cases do colour-colour diagrams or spectral fitting provide evidence of black hole nature.
doc	Many-body effects on the resistivity of a multiorbital system beyond Landau's Fermi-liquid theory EOS I review many-body effects on the resistivity of a multiorbital system beyond Landau's Fermi-liquid (FL) theory. EOS Landau's FL theory succeeds in describing electronic properties of some correlated electron systems at low temperatures. EOS However, the behaviors deviating from the temperature dependence in the FL, non-FL-like behaviors, emerge near a magnetic quantum-critical point. EOS These indicate the importance of many-body effects beyond Landau's FL theory. EOS Those effects in multiorbital systems have been little understood, although their understanding is important to deduce ubiquitous properties of correlated electron systems and characteristic properties of multiorbital systems.	To improve this situation, I formulate the resistivity of a multiorbital Hubbard model using the extended \' E liashberg theory and adopt this method to the inplane resistivity of quasi-two-dimensional paramagnetic ruthenates in combination with the fluctuation-exchange approximation including the current vertex corrections arising from the self-energy and Maki-Thompson term.
doc	Domino plasmons for subwavelength terahertz circuitry EOS A new approach for the spatial and temporal modulation of electromagnetic fields at terahertz frequencies is presented. EOS The waveguiding elements are based on plasmonic and metamaterial notions and consist of an easy-to-manufacture periodic chain of metallic box-shaped elements protruding out of a metallic surface.	It is shown that the dispersion relation of the corresponding electromagnetic modes is rather insensitive to the waveguide width, preserving tight confinement and reasonable absorption loss even when the waveguide transverse dimensions are well in the subwavelength regime.
doc	The cyclo-synchrotron process and particle heating through the absorption of photons EOS We propose a new approximation for the cyclo-synchrotron emissivity of a single electron. EOS In the second part of this work, we discuss a simple application for our approximation, and investigate the heating of electrons through the self-absorption process. EOS Finally, we investigate the self-absorbed part of the spectrum produced by a power-law population of electrons. EOS In comparison to earlier approximations, our formula provides a few significant advantages. EOS Integration of the emissivity over the whole frequency range, starting from the proper minimal emitting frequency, gives the correct cooling rate for any energy particle. EOS Further, the spectrum of the emission is well approximated over the whole frequency range, even for relatively low particle energies (beta << 0.1), where most of the power is emitted in the first harmonic. EOS In order to test our continuous approximation, we compare it with a recently derived approximation of the first ten harmonics. EOS Finally, our formula connects relatively smooth to the synchrotron emission at beta=0.9. EOS We show that the self-absorption is a very efficient heating mechanism for low energy particles, independent of the shape of the particle distribution responsible for the self-absorbed synchrotron emission. EOS We find that the energy gains for low energy particles are always higher than energy losses by cyclo-synchrotron emission.	We show also that the spectral index of the self-absorbed part of the spectrum at very low frequencies differs significantly from the well known standard relation I(nu) ~ nu^(5/2).

doc	Indirect to direct gap crossover in two-dimensional InSe revealed by ARPES EOS Atomically thin films of III-VI post-transition metal chalcogenides (InSe and GaSe) form an interesting class of two-dimensional semiconductor that feature strong variations of their band gap as a function of the number of layers in the crystal [1-4] and, specifically for InSe, an earlier predicted crossover from a direct gap in the bulk [5,6] to a weakly indirect band gap in monolayers and bilayers [7-11]. EOS Here, we apply angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy with submicrometer spatial resolution (_EQN_ ARPES) to visualise the layer-dependent valence band structure of mechanically exfoliated crystals of InSe. EOS We show that for 1 layer and 2 layer InSe the valence band maxima are away from the _EQN_ -point, forming an indirect gap, with the conduction band edge known to be at the _EQN_ -point. EOS In contrast, for six or more layers the bandgap becomes direct, in good agreement with theoretical predictions. EOS The high-quality monolayer and bilayer samples enables us to resolve, in the photoluminescence spectra, the band-edge exciton (A) from the exciton (B) involving holes in a pair of deeper valence bands, degenerate at _EQN_, with the splitting that agrees with both _EQN_ ARPES data and the results of DFT modelling.	Due to the difference in symmetry between these two valence bands, light emitted by the A-exciton should be predominantly polarised perpendicular to the plane of the two-dimensional crystal, which we have verified for few-layer InSe crystals.
doc	A characterization of a class of optimal three-weight cyclic codes of dimension 3 over any finite field EOS It is well known that the problem of determining the weight distributions of families of cyclic codes is, in general, notoriously difficult. EOS An even harder problem is to find characterizations of families of cyclic codes in terms of their weight distributions. EOS On the other hand, it is also well known that cyclic codes with few weights have a great practical importance in coding theory and cryptography. EOS In particular, cyclic codes having three nonzero weights have been studied by several authors, however, most of these efforts focused on cyclic codes over a prime field. EOS In this work we present a characterization of a class of optimal three-weight cyclic codes of dimension 3 over any finite field. EOS The codes under this characterization are, indeed, optimal in the sense that their lengths reach the Griesmer lower bound for linear codes. EOS Consequently, these codes reach, simultaneously, the best possible coding capacity, and also the best possible capabilities of error detection and correction for linear codes. EOS But because they are cyclic in nature, they also possess a rich algebraic structure that can be utilized in a variety of ways, particularly, in the design of very efficient coding and decoding algorithms. EOS What is also worth pointing out, is the simplicity of the necessary and sufficient numerical conditions that characterize our class of optimal three-weight cyclic codes. EOS As we already pointed out, it is a hard problem to find this kind of characterizations. EOS However, for this particular case the fundamental tool that allowed us to find our characterization was the characterization for all two-weight irreducible cyclic codes that was introduced by B.	Schmidt and C.

EOS Furthermore, we discuss radiative corrections for the Dalitz decays _EQN_ beyond the soft-photon approximation.	The corrections inevitably depend on the _EQN_ transition form factors.
doc	Galam's bottom-up hierarchical system and public debate model revisited EOS This article is concerned with the bottom-up hierarchical system and public debate model proposed by Galam, as well as a spatial version of the public debate model. EOS In all three models, there is a population of individuals who are characterized by one of two competing opinions, say opinion -1 and opinion +1. EOS This population is further divided into groups of common size s. EOS In the bottom-up hierarchical system, each group elects a representative candidate, whereas in the other two models, all the members of each group discuss at random times until they reach a consensus. EOS At each election/discussion, the winning opinion is chosen according to Galam's majority rule: the opinion with the majority of representants wins when there is a strict majority while one opinion, say opinion -1, is chosen by default in case of a tie. EOS For the public debate models, we also consider the following natural updating rule that we shall call proportional rule: the winning opinion is chosen at random with a probability equal to the fraction of its supporters in the group.	The three models differ in term of their population structure: in the bottom-up hierarchical system, individuals are located on a finite regular tree, in the non-spatial public debate model, they are located on a complete graph, and in the spatial public debate model, they are located on the _EQN_ -dimensional regular lattice.

doc	De-Health: All Your Online Health Information Are Belong to Us EOS In this paper, we study the privacy of online health data. EOS We present a novel online health data De-Anonymization (DA) framework, named De-Health. EOS De-Health consists of two phases: Top-K DA, which identifies a candidate set for each anonymized user, and refined DA, which de-anonymizes an anonymized user to a user in its candidate set. EOS By employing both candidate selection and DA verification schemes, De-Health significantly reduces the DA space by several orders of magnitude while achieving promising DA accuracy. EOS Leveraging two real world online health datasets WebMD (89,393 users, 506K posts) and HealthBoards (388,398 users, 4.7M posts), we validate the efficacy of De-Health. EOS Further, when the training data are insufficient, De-Health can still successfully de-anonymize a large portion of anonymized users. EOS We develop the first analytical framework on the soundness and effectiveness of online health data DA. EOS By analyzing the impact of various data features on the anonymity, we derive the conditions and probabilities for successfully de-anonymizing one user or a group of users in exact DA and Top-K DA. EOS Our analysis is meaningful to both researchers and policy makers in facilitating the development of more effective anonymization techniques and proper privacy polices.	We present a linkage attack framework which can link online health/medical information to real world people.
doc	Complexity and the Limits of Revolution: What Will Happen to the Arab Spring? EOS The recent social unrest across the Middle East and North Africa has deposed dictators who had ruled for decades. EOS While the events have been hailed as an "Arab Spring" by those who hope that repressive autocracies will be replaced by democracies, what sort of regimes will eventually emerge from the crisis remains far from certain. EOS Here we provide a complex systems framework, validated by historical precedent, to help answer this question. EOS We describe the dynamics of governmental change as an evolutionary process similar to biological evolution, in which complex organizations gradually arise by replication, variation and competitive selection.	Different kinds of governments, however, have differing levels of complexity.
doc	SDL based validation of a node monitoring protocol EOS Mobile ad hoc network is a wireless, self-configured, infrastructureless network of mobile nodes. EOS The nodes are highly mobile, which makes the application running on them face network related problems like node failure, link failure, network level disconnection, scarcity of resources, buffer degradation, and intermittent disconnection etc. EOS Node failure and Network fault are need to be monitored continuously by supervising the network status. EOS Node monitoring protocol is crucial, so it is required to test the protocol exhaustively to verify and validate the functionality and accuracy of the designed protocol. EOS This paper presents a validation model for Node Monitoring Protocol using Specification and Description Llanguage (SDL) using both Static Agent (SA) and Mobile Agent (MA). EOS We have verified properties of the Node Monitoring Protocol (NMP) based on the global states with no exits, deadlock states or proper termination states using reachability graph.	Message Sequence Chart (MSC) gives an intuitive understanding of the described system behavior with varying node density and complex behavior etc.

doc	Levy walk with multiple internal states EOS Levy walk is a fundamental model with applications ranging from quantum physics to paths of animal foraging. EOS Taking animal foraging as an example, a natural idea that comes to one's mind is to introduce the multiple internal states for dealing with the dependence of the PDF of waiting time on the energy of the animal and richness of the food at a particular location, etc; EOS the framework can also be used to model the moving trajectories of smart animals without returning to the directions or locations which they come from immediately.	After building the Levy walk model with multiple internal states and deriving the governing equation of the distribution of the positions of the particles, some applications are discussed with specific transition matrices.

doc	Big Bang nucleosynthesis and physics beyond the Standard Model EOS The Hubble expansion of galaxies, the _EQN_ blackbody radiation background and the cosmic abundances of the light elements argue for a hot, dense origin of the universe --- the standard Big Bang cosmology --- and enable its evolution to be traced back fairly reliably to the nucleosynthesis era when the temperature was of _EQN_ MeV corresponding to an expansion age of _EQN_ sec. EOS All particles, known and hypothetical, would have been created at higher temperatures in the early universe and analyses of their possible effects on the abundances of the synthesized elements enable many interesting constraints to be obtained on particle properties.	These arguments have usefully complemented laboratory experiments in guiding attempts to extend physics beyond the Standard _EQN_ Model, incorporating ideas such as supersymmetry, compositeness and unification.

doc	Shape Dynamics of Interfacial Front in Rotating Cylinders EOS The evolution of the interface propagation in a slowly rotating half-filled horizontal cylinder is studied using MRI. EOS Initially, the cylinder contains two axially segregated bands of small and large particles with a sharp interface. EOS The process of the formation of the radial core is clearly captured, and the shape and the velocity of the propagating front are calculated by assuming a one-dimensional diffusion process along the rotation axis of the cylinder and a separation of time scales associated with segregation in the radial and axial directions.	We found that the interfacial dynamics are best described when a concentration dependent diffusion process is assumed.
doc	Bursts from internal shocks: is it really synchrotron emission? EOS Within the standard internal shock scenario, synchrotron emission would produce a spectrum with slope F(v) proportional to v^(-1/2), as immediate consequence of the cooling timescale being shorter than the integration time. EOS This is in disagreement with the harder observed spectra, indicating that a different mechanism is responsible for the burst emission.	Furthermore in this scenario pair production is expected when photons produced by inverse Compton emission are taken into account.

doc	Interpolated inequalities between exponential and Gaussian, Orlicz hypercontractivity and isoperimetry EOS We introduce and study a notion of Orlicz hypercontractive semigroups. EOS We analyze their relations with general _EQN_ -Sobolev inequalities, thus extending Gross hypercontractivity theory. EOS We provide criteria for these Sobolev type inequalities and for related properties. EOS In particular, we implement in the context of probability measures the ideas of Maz'ja's capacity theory, and present equivalent forms relating the capacity of sets to their measure. EOS Orlicz hypercontractivity efficiently describes the integrability improving properties of the Heat semigroup associated to the Boltzmann measures _EQN_, when _EQN_. EOS As an application we derive accurate isoperimetric inequalities for their products.	This completes earlier works by Bobkov-Houdr\'e and Talagrand, and provides a scale of dimension free isoperimetric inequalities as well as comparison theorems.
doc	Theoretical limits on magnetic field strengths in low-mass stars EOS Observations have suggested that some low-mass stars have larger radii than predicted by 1-D structure models. EOS Some theoretical models have invoked very strong interior magnetic fields (of order 1 MG or more) as a possible cause of such large radii. EOS Whether fields of that strength could in principle by generated by dynamo action in these objects is unclear, and we do not address the matter directly. EOS Instead, we examine whether such fields could remain in the interior of a low mass object for a significant time, and whether they would have any other obvious signatures. EOS First, we estimate timescales for the loss of strong fields by magnetic buoyancy instabilities. EOS We consider a range of field strengths and simple morphologies, including both idealized flux tubes and smooth layers of field. EOS We confirm some of our analytical estimates using thin flux tube magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the rise of buoyant fields in a fully-convective M-dwarf.	Separately, we consider the Ohmic dissipation of such fields.
doc	Exploiting Sparse Dynamics For Bandwidth Reduction In Cooperative Sensing Systems EOS Recently, there has been a significant interest in developing cooperative sensing systems for certain types of wireless applications. EOS In such systems, a group of sensing nodes periodically collect measurements about the signals being observed in the given geographical region and transmit these measurements to a central node, which in turn processes this information to recover the signals.	For example, in cognitive radio networks, the signals of interest are those generated by the primary transmitters and the sensing nodes are the secondary users.

In particular, we recover some results regarding short, and stretched, Gorenstein Artin rings.
doc	Protein Structure Prediction by Protein Alignments EOS Proteins are the basic building blocks of life. EOS They usually perform functions by folding to a particular structure. EOS Understanding the folding process could help the researchers to understand the functions of proteins and could also help to develop supplemental proteins for people with deficiencies and gain more insight into diseases associated with troublesome folding proteins. EOS Experimental methods are both expensive and time consuming. EOS In this thesis I introduce a new machine learning based method to predict the protein structure. EOS The new method improves the performance from two directions: creating accurate protein alignments and predicting accurate protein contacts. EOS First, I present an alignment framework MRFalign which goes beyond state-of-the-art methods and uses Markov Random Fields to model a protein family and align two proteins by aligning two MRFs together. EOS Compared to other methods, that can only model local-range residue correlation, MRFs can model long-range residue interactions and thus, encodes global information in a protein. EOS Secondly, I present a Group Graphical Lasso method for contact prediction that integrates joint multi-family Evolutionary Coupling analysis and supervised learning to improve accuracy on proteins without many sequence homologs.	Different from single-family EC analysis that uses residue co-evolution information in only the target protein family, our joint EC analysis uses residue co-evolution in both the target family and its related families, which may have divergent sequences but similar folds.

doc	Dynamics of fracturing saturated porous media and self-organization of rupture EOS Analytical solutions and a vast majority of numerical ones for fracture propagation in saturated porous media yield smooth behavior while experiments, field observations and a few numerical solutions reveal stepwise crack advancement and pressure oscillations. EOS To explain this fact, we invoke self-organization of rupture observed in fracturing solids, both dry and fully saturated, when two requirements are satisfied: i) the external drive has a much slower timescale than fracture propagation; EOS and ii) the increment of the external load (drive) is applied only when the internal rearrangement of fracture is over. EOS These requirements are needed to obtain clean Self Organised Criticality (SOC) in quasi-static situations. EOS They imply that there should be no restriction on the fracture velocity i.e. EOS algorithmically the fracture advancement rule should always be independent of the crack velocity. EOS Generally, this is not the case when smooth answers are obtained which are often unphysical. EOS Under the above conditions hints of Self Organized Criticality are evident in heterogeneous porous media in quasi-static conditions using a lattice model, showing stepwise advancement of the fracture and pressure oscillations. EOS We extend this model to incorporate inertia forces and show that this behavior still holds.	By incorporating the above requirements in numerical fracture advancement algorithms for cohesive fracture in saturated porous continua we also reproduce stepwise advancements and pressure oscillations both in quasi-static and dynamic situations.
doc	The XXL Survey VIII: MUSE characterisation of intracluster light in a z _EQN_ 0.53 cluster of galaxies EOS Within a cluster, gravitational effects can lead to the removal of stars from their parent galaxies. EOS Gas hydrodynamical effects can additionally strip gas and dust from galaxies. EOS The properties of the ICL can therefore help constrain the physical processes at work in clusters by serving as a fossil record of the interaction history. EOS The present study is designed to characterise this ICL in a ~10^14 M_odot and z~0.53 cluster of galaxies from imaging and spectroscopic points of view. EOS By applying a wavelet-based method to CFHT Megacam and WIRCAM images, we detect significant quantities of diffuse light. EOS These sources were then spectroscopically characterised with MUSE. EOS MUSE data were also used to compute redshifts of 24 cluster galaxies and search for cluster substructures. EOS An atypically large amount of ICL has been detected in this cluster. EOS Part of the detected diffuse light has a very weak optical stellar component and apparently consists mainly of gas emission, while other diffuse light sources are clearly dominated by old stars.	Furthermore, emission lines were detected in several places of diffuse light.

Calibration of Synthetic Photometry EOS We present a new calibration of optical (UBV, Stromgren, uvby-beta, and Geneva) and near IR (Johnson RIJHK and 2MASS) photometry for B and early A stars derived from Kurucz (1991) Atlas model atmospheres. EOS Our sample of stars consists of 45 normal, nearby B and early A stars which have high quality, low resolution IUE spectra and accurate Hipparcos parallaxes. EOS The calibration is unique because it relies only on the UV spectral energy distributions, the absolute flux calibration of the V filter and the Hipparcos distances to determine the appropriate model atmospheres for the program stars. EOS These models are then used to calibrate the synthetic photometry.	We compare our results with previous, well accepted results and provide a thorough discussion of the random errors and systematic effects affecting the calibration.
doc	Radical increase of the parametric X-ray intensity under condition of extremely asymmetric diffraction EOS Parametric X-ray radiation (PXR) from relativistic electrons moving in a crystal along the crystal-vacuum interface is considered. EOS In this geometry the emission of photons is happening in the regime of extremely asymmetric diffraction (EAD). EOS In the EAD case the whole crystal length contributes to the formation of X-ray radiation opposed to Laue and Bragg geometries, where the emission intensity is defined by the X-ray absorption length. EOS We demonstrate that this phenomenon should be described within the dynamical theory of diffraction and predict a radical increase of the PXR intensity.	In particular, under realistic electron-beam parameters, an increase of two orders of magnitude in PXR-EAD intensity can be obtained in comparison with conventional experimental geometries of PXR.

doc	Energy Confused Adversarial Metric Learning for Zero-Shot Image Retrieval and Clustering EOS Deep metric learning has been widely applied in many computer vision tasks, and recently, it is more attractive in ph zero-shot image retrieval and clustering (ZSRC) where a good embedding is requested such that the unseen classes can be distinguished well. EOS Most existing works deem this 'good' embedding just to be the discriminative one and thus race to devise powerful metric objectives or hard-sample mining strategies for leaning discriminative embedding. EOS However, in this paper, we first emphasize that the generalization ability is a core ingredient of this 'good' embedding as well and largely affects the metric performance in zero-shot settings as a matter of fact. EOS Then, we propose the Energy Confused Adversarial Metric Learning(ECAML) framework to explicitly optimize a robust metric. EOS It is mainly achieved by introducing an interesting Energy Confusion regularization term, which daringly breaks away from the traditional metric learning idea of discriminative objective devising, and seeks to 'confuse' the learned model so as to encourage its generalization ability by reducing overfitting on the seen classes. EOS We train this confusion term together with the conventional metric objective in an adversarial manner.	Although it seems weird to 'confuse' the network, we show that our ECAML indeed serves as an efficient regularization technique for metric learning and is applicable to various conventional metric methods.
doc	Impact of single and double oxygen vacancies on electronic transport in Fe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junctions EOS To study the impact of oxygen vacancies on spin-polarized transport, we have computed the electronic and transport properties of single (F centers) and paired (M centers) oxygen vacancies using density functional theory. EOS These point defects can generate barrier heights as low as 0.4V for FeCo electrodes irrespective of the defect's spatial position within the barrier, and of the orientation of the M center. EOS These defects promote a strong decrease in the conductance of the spin up channel in the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ)'s parallel (P) magnetic state that mainly accounts for an order-of-magnitude drop in TMR, from about 10000 _EQN_ in the ideal case toward values more in line with experiment.	When placed in the middle layer of the MgO barrier, the F center introduces additional P _EQN_ transmission away from the _EQN_ point.

EOS The source was first detected over the course of five Chandra observations in 2007, reaching an unabsorbed outburst luminosity of 1-2*10^38 erg/s in the 0.5-7.0 keV band before returning to quiescence.

We discuss the quantum-confinement-induced interplay between bulk-material and orbital effects, which is nontrivial due to the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling.
doc	Exploring the Fairness and Resource Distribution in an Apache Mesos Environment EOS Apache Mesos, a cluster-wide resource manager, is widely deployed in massive scale at several Clouds and Data Centers. EOS Mesos aims to provide high cluster utilization via fine grained resource co-scheduling and resource fairness among multiple users through Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) based allocation. EOS DRF takes into account different resource types (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O) requested by each application and determines the share of each cluster resource that could be allocated to the applications. EOS Mesos has adopted a two-level scheduling policy: (1) DRF to allocate resources to competing frameworks and (2) task level scheduling by each framework for the resources allocated during the previous step. EOS We have conducted experiments in a local Mesos cluster when used with frameworks such as Apache Aurora, Marathon, and our own framework Scylla, to study resource fairness and cluster utilization. EOS Experimental results show how informed decision regarding second level scheduling policy of frameworks and attributes like offer holding period, offer refusal cycle and task arrival rate can reduce unfair resource distribution.

EOS Our use of short-wavelength photometry affords us an exceedingly clear view of stellar motions into the very center of the crowded core, yielding proper motions for _EQN_ 50,000 stars in the central 2'.	We model the velocity dispersion profile of the cluster using an isotropic Jeans model.

doc	The effects of three-dimensional defects on one-way surface plasmon propagation for photonic topological insulators comprised of continuous media EOS We have investigated the one-way surface plasmon-polariton (SPP) at the interface of a continuous magneto-plasma material and metal. EOS We demonstrated that TM modes inside a continuous material can be assigned non-trivial Chern numbers analogous to those of topological photonic crystals; EOS moreover these Chern numbers can be calculated analytically. EOS This leads to the appearance of topologically protected surface modes propagating at frequencies inside the bandgap of the magneto-plasma. EOS Previous works considered 2D structures; EOS here we consider the effects of 3D defects, and show that, although backward propagation/reflection cannot occur, side scattering does take place and it has significant effect on the propagation of the surface mode.	Several different waveguiding geometries are considered for reducing the effects of side-scattering, and we also consider the effects of metal loss.
doc	Automated Aggregator -- Rewriting with the Counting Aggregate EOS Answer set programming is a leading declarative constraint programming paradigm with wide use for complex knowledge-intensive applications. EOS Modern answer set programming languages support many equivalent ways to model constraints and specifications in a program. EOS However, so far answer set programming has failed to develop systematic methodologies for building representations that would uniformly lend well to automated processing. EOS This suggests that encoding selection, in the same way as algorithm selection and portfolio solving, may be a viable direction for improving performance of answer-set solving.	The necessary precondition is automating the process of generating possible alternative encodings.
doc	Modular inequalities for the maximal operator in variable Lebesgue spaces EOS A now classical result in the theory of variable Lebesgue spaces due to Lerner [A. EOS K. EOS Lerner, On modular inequalities in variable _EQN_ spaces, Archiv der Math. EOS 85 (2005), no.

EOS We work in ZFC except when noted, as several constructions appeal to complete ultrafilters thus assume a measurable cardinal.	The main results are as follows.

EOS The original method (F. EOS Bagnoli, A. EOS Berrones and F. EOS Franci. EOS Physica A 332 (2004) 509-518) was formulated in the context of opinion formation. EOS The opinions expressed over a set of topic originate a ``knowledge network'' among individuals, where two individuals are nearer the more similar their expressed opinions are. EOS Assuming that individuals' opinions are stored in a database, the authors show that it is possible to anticipate an opinion using the correlations in the database.	This corresponds to approximating the overlap between the tastes of two individuals with the correlations of their expressed opinions.

doc	Simultaneous monitoring of fluxonium qubits in a waveguide EOS Most quantum-error correcting codes assume that the decoherence of each physical qubit is independent of the decoherence of any other physical qubit.

Here, we investigate the correlations between fluxonium qubits located in a single waveguide.
doc	Assessment of research frameworks for on-farm experimentation through a simulation study of wheat yield in Japan EOS On-farm experiments can provide farmers with information on more efficient crop management in their own fields. EOS Recent developments in precision agricultural technologies, such as yield monitoring and variable-rate application technology, allow farmers to implement on-farm experiments easily. EOS Research frameworks including the experimental design, data collection and preprocessing steps, and the statistical analysis method strongly influences the precision of the experiment. EOS Conventional statistical approaches (e.g., ordinary least squares regression) may not be appropriate for on-farm experiments because they are not capable of accurately accounting for the underlying spatial variations in a particular response variable (e.g., yield data). EOS We explored the effect of sensor types, data preprocessing, experimental designs, and statistical approaches on the type I error rates and estimation accuracy through a simulation study hypothesized to conduct on-farm experiments in 3 wheat fields in Japan. EOS Isotropic and anisotropic spatial linear mixed models were established for comparison with ordinary least squares regression models. EOS The repeated designs were not sufficient to reduce both the risk of a type I error and the estimation bias. EOS A combination of a repeated design and an anisotropic model is required to improve the precision of the experiments.	Although the anisotropic model sometimes did not contribute to reducing the bias efficiently, the results of the anisotropic model showed large standard errors, especially when the estimates had large biases.
doc	Variations of Independence in Boolean Algebras EOS We give a definition of some classes of boolean algebras generalizing free boolean algebras; EOS they satisfy a universal property that certain functions extend to homomorphisms. EOS We give a combinatorial property of generating sets of these algebras, which we call n -independent. EOS The properties of these classes (n-free and omega-free boolean algebras) are investigated. EOS These include connections to hypergraph theory and cardinal invariants on these algebras. EOS Related cardinal functions, n Ind, which is the supremum of the cardinalities of n-independent subsets; EOS i_n, the minimum size of a maximal n -independent subset; EOS and i_omega, the minimum size of an omega-independent subset, are introduced and investigated. EOS The values of i_n and i_omega on P(omega)/fin are shown to be independent of ZFC.	Ideal-independence is also considered, and it is shown that the cardinal function p <= s_mm for infinite boolean algebras.
doc	Observations of Classical and Recurrent Novae with X-ray Gratings EOS X-ray grating spectra have opened a new window on the nova physics.

EOS They offer the only way to probe the temperature, effective gravity and chemical composition of the hydrogen burning white dwarf before it turns off. EOS These spectra also allow an analysis of the ejecta, which can be photoionized by the hot white dwarf, but more often seem to undergo collisional ionization.	The long observations required for the gratings have revealed semi-regular and irregular variability in X-ray flux and spectra.

EOS The expansion of matter in the magma chamber which takes place during its heating, leads to elastic stresses in the solid shell surrounding the magma chamber. EOS The elastic energy of such stresses can be as high as 10^17 J per 1 km3 of the melt.	The magma flow rate has been assessed according to available data, which agrees well with the observation data.
doc	Piecewise Linear Valued CSPs Solvable by Linear Programming Relaxation EOS Valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) are a large class of combinatorial optimisation problems. EOS The computational complexity of VCSPs depends on the set of allowed cost functions in the input. EOS Recently, the computational complexity of all VCSPs for finite sets of cost functions over finite domains has been classified. EOS Many natural optimisation problems, however, cannot be formulated as VCSPs over a finite domain. EOS We initiate the systematic investigation of infinite-domain VCSPs by studying the complexity of VCSPs for piecewise linear homogeneous cost functions. EOS Such VCSPs can be solved in polynomial time if the cost functions are improved by fully symmetric fractional operations of all arities.	We show this by reducing the problem to a finite-domain VCSP which can be solved using the basic linear program relaxation.
doc	_EQN_ nuclei: A laboratory for neutron-proton collective mode EOS The neutron-neutron and proton-proton pairing correlations have long been recognised to be the dominant many-body correlation beyond the nuclear mean field since the introduction of pairing mechanism by Bohr, Mottelson and Pines nearly 60 year ago. EOS Nevertheless, few conclusion has been reached concerning the existence of analogous neutron-proton (np) pair correlated state. EOS One can see a renaissance in np correlation studies in relation to the significant progress in radioactive ion beam facilities and detection techniques. EOS The np pairs can couple isospin T = 1 (isovector) or 0 (isoscalar). EOS In the isovector channel, the angular momentum zero component is expected to be the most importance one. EOS On the other hand, as one may infer from the general properties of the np two-body interaction, in the isoscalar channel, both the np pairs with minimum (J=1) and maximum (J=2j) spin values can be important. EOS In this contribution, we will discuss the possible evidence for np pair coupling from different perspective and analyze its influence on interesting phenomena including the Wigner effect and mass correlations in odd-odd nuclei.	In particular, we will explain the spin-aligned pair coupling scheme and quartet coupling involving pairs with maximum (J=2j) spin values.
doc	Ionization front-driven turbulence in the clumpy interstellar medium EOS We present 3D radiation-gasdynamical simulations of an ionization front running into a dense clump. EOS In our setup, a B0 star irradiates an overdensity which is at a distance of 10 pc and modelled as a supercritical 100 M_sol Bonnor-Ebert sphere. EOS The radiation from the star heats up the gas and creates a shock front that expands into the interstellar medium. EOS The shock compresses the clump material while the ionizing radiation heats it up. EOS The outcome of this "cloud-crushing" process is a fully turbulent gas in the wake of the clump.	In the end, the clump entirely dissolves.
doc	Deep-Learning Jets with Uncertainties and More EOS Bayesian neural networks allow us to keep track of uncertainties, for example in top tagging, by learning a tagger output together with an error band.

Altogether, Bayesian networks offer many new handles to understand and control deep learning at the LHC without introducing a visible prior effect and without compromising the network performance.
doc	Spectroscopy of MACHO 97-SMC-1: self-lensing within the SMC EOS More than a dozen microlensing events have been detected so far towards the LMC and 2 towards the SMC. EOS If all the lenses are in the Galactic halo, both the LMC and the SMC events are expected to have similar time scales. EOS However, the first event towards the SMC, MACHO 97-SMC-1, had a time scale of 123 days which is much larger than the typical time scale for the LMC events. EOS From optical depth estimates, we first show that the stars within the SMC play a dominant role as gravitational lenses and can fully account for the observed microlensing events, mainly due to its large physical depth.	We also show that if the lenses are within the Magellanic Clouds, then the SMC events should be longer in duration than the LMC events, a fact that is consistent with the observations.
doc	Comparing transverse momentum balance of b jet pairs in pp and PbPb collisions at _EQN_ 5.02 TeV EOS The transverse momentum balance of pairs of back-to-back b quark jets in PbPb and pp collisions recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC is reported. EOS The center-of-mass energy in both collision systems is 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair. EOS Compared to the pp collision baseline, b quark jets have a larger imbalance in the most central PbPb collisions, as expected from the jet quenching effect.	The data are also compared to the corresponding measurement with inclusive dijets.
doc	Near constant loss dielectric response in 2Bi2O3-B2O3 glasses EOS Electrical conduction and relaxation phenomena in bismuth borate glasses in the composition 2Bi2O3-B2O3 (Bi4B2O9) were investigated. EOS Dielectric studies carried out on these glasses revealed near constant loss (NCL) response in the 1 kHz to 1MHz frequency range at moderately high temperatures (300-450K) associated with relatively low loss (D=0.006) and high dielectric constant (\epsilon r'=37) at 1kHz,300K.	The variation in AC conductivity with temperature at different frequencies showed a cross over from NCL response characterized by local ion vibration within the potential well to universal Joncher's power law dependence triggered by ion hopping between potential wells or cages.

doc	Increasing Indoor Spectrum Sharing Capacity using Smart Reflect-Array EOS The radio frequency (RF) spectrum becomes overly crowded in some indoor environments due to the high density of users and bandwidth demands. EOS To accommodate the tremendous wireless data demands, efficient spectrum-sharing approaches are highly desired. EOS To this end, this paper introduces a new spectrum sharing solution for indoor environments based on the usage of a reconfigurable reflect-array in the middle of the wireless channel. EOS By optimally controlling the phase shift of each element on the reflect-array, the useful signals for each transmission pair can be enhanced while the interferences can be canceled.	As a result, multiple wireless users in the same room can access the same spectrum band at the same time without interfering each other.

A near-resonant magnetic field is applied to mix the hyperfine singlet and triplet components of the initial wave function and enhance the photoassociation rate, before the population is transferred to the ground state by a second pulse.
doc	Monitoring Air Moisture with Laser Absorption Spectroscopy EOS Determination of air density and the quantitative estimates of water vapour adsorbed or desorbed by the surface of mass standard, remain the principals sources of uncertainties when weighing mass standard made from stainless steel or super alloy. EOS The classical method, for air density determination, use the so called CIPM-1981/91 formula and the measured air parameters. EOS An other approach is based only on the results of comparisons, realized successively in air and in vacuum, between special artefacts. EOS The distribution and the state of water molecules inside the chamber of mass comparator influence the results of weighing. EOS Also, the instruments used for air moisture measurement are either, not very sensitive (capacitive hygrometer) or disturbing for environment (dew-point hygrometer). EOS To control that, a proposal method is given and observations of water vapour behaviour inside the enclosure for different conditions are reported.	Keywords.
doc	Isolating signatures of major cloud-cloud collisions using position-velocity diagrams EOS Collisions between giant molecular clouds are a potential mechanism for triggering the formation of massive stars, or even super star clusters. EOS The trouble is identifying this process observationally and distinguishing it from other mechanisms. EOS We produce synthetic position-velocity diagrams from models of: cloud-cloud collisions, non-interacting clouds along the line of sight, clouds with internal radiative feedback and a more complex cloud evolving in a galactic disc, to try and identify unique signatures of collision. EOS We find that a broad bridge feature connecting two intensity peaks, spatially correlated but separated in velocity, is a signature of a high velocity cloud-cloud collision. EOS We show that the broad bridge feature is resilient to the effects of radiative feedback, at least to around 2.5Myr after the formation of the first massive (ionising) star. EOS However for a head on 10km/s collision we find that this will only be observable from 20-30 per cent of viewing angles.	Such broad-bridge features have been identified towards M20, a very young region of massive star formation that was concluded to be a site of cloud-cloud collision by Torii et al (2011), and also towards star formation in the outer Milky Way by Izumi et al (2014).

doc	Economic Properties of Multi-Product Supply Chains EOS We interpret multi-product supply chains (SCs) as coordinated markets; EOS under this interpretation, a SC optimization problem is a market clearing problem that allocates resources and associated economic values (prices) to different stakeholders that bid into the market (suppliers, consumers, transportation, and processing technologies). EOS The market interpretation allows us to establish fundamental properties that explain how physical resources (primal variables) and associated economic values (dual variables) flow in the SC. EOS We use duality theory to explain why incentivizing markets by forcing stakeholder participation (e.g., by imposing demand satisfaction or service provision constraints) yields artificial price behavior, inefficient allocations, and economic losses. EOS To overcome these issues, we explore market incentive mechanisms that use bids; EOS here, we introduce the concept of a stakeholder graph (a product-based representation of a supply chain) and show that this representation allows us to naturally determine minimum bids that activate the market. EOS These results provide guidelines to design SC formulations that properly remunerate stakeholders and to design policy that foster market transactions.	The results are illustrated using an urban waste management problem for a city of 100,000 residents.
doc	Coupled Classical and Quantum Oscillators EOS Some of the most enduring questions in physics--including the quantum measurement problem and the quantization of gravity--involve the interaction of a quantum system with a classical environment. EOS Two linearly coupled harmonic oscillators provide a simple, exactly soluble model for exploring such interaction.

doc	Trojan resonant dynamics, stability, and chaotic diffusion, for parameters relevant to exoplanetary systems EOS We investigate the dynamics of small trojan exoplanets in domains of secondary resonances within the tadpole domain of motion. EOS We consider the limit of a massless trojan companion of a giant planet. EOS Without other planets, this is a case of the elliptic restricted three body problem (ERTBP). EOS The presence of more planets (the restricted multi-planet problem, RMPP) induces new direct and indirect secular effects on the trojan's dynamics. EOS In the theoretical part of this paper, we develop a Hamiltonian formalism in action-angle variables, which allows to treat in a unified way resonant dynamics and secular effects on the trojan body in both the ERTBP or the RMPP. EOS Our formalism leads to a decomposition of the Hamiltonian in two parts, _EQN_. EOS _EQN_, called the basic model, describes resonant dynamics in the short-period (epicyclic) and synodic (libration) degrees of freedom. EOS _EQN_ contains only terms depending on slow (secular) angles. EOS _EQN_ is formally identical in the ERTBP and the RMPP, apart from a re-definition of angular variables.	An important physical consequence is that the slow chaotic diffusion proceeds in both the ERTBP and the RMPP by a qualitatively similar dynamical mechanism better approximated by the paradigm of `modulational diffusion'.
doc	The stability and rapid exponential stabilization of heat equation in non-cylindrical domain EOS This paper is devoted to the study of the stability and stabilizability of heat equation in non-cylindrical domain.

EOS The system is only polynomially stable or only analogously exponentially stable.	Then, the rapid exponential stabilization of the system is obtained by the backstepping method.

The typical period increase rates are of the same order of magnitude as model calculations predict for the evolved, redward phase of horizontal branch evolution.
doc	A box full of chocolates: The rich structure of the nearby stellar halo revealed by Gaia and RAVE EOS The hierarchical structure formation model predicts that stellar halos should form, at least partly, via mergers. EOS If this was a predominant formation channel for the Milky Way's halo, imprints of this merger history in the form of moving groups or streams should exist also in the vicinity of the Sun. EOS Here we study the kinematics of halo stars in the Solar neighbourhood using the very recent first data release from the Gaia mission, and in particular the TGAS dataset, in combination with data from the RAVE survey. EOS Our aim is to determine the amount of substructure present in the phase-space distribution of halo stars that could be linked to merger debris.	To characterise kinematic substructure, we measure the velocity correlation function in our sample of halo (low metallicity) stars.
doc	Global Optimal Trajectory in Chaos and NP-Hardness EOS This paper presents a new canonical duality methodology for solving general nonlinear dynamical systems. EOS Instead of the conventional iterative methods, the discretized nonlinear system is first formulated as a global optimization problem via the least squares method. EOS The canonical duality theory shows that this nonconvex minimization problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time if a global optimality condition is satisfied. EOS The so-called pseudo-chaos produced by Runge-Kutta type of linear iterations are mainly due to the intrinsic numerical error accumulations. EOS Otherwise, the global optimization problem could be NP-hard and the nonlinear system can be really chaotic. EOS A conjecture is proposed, which reveals the connection between chaos in nonlinear dynamics and NP-hardness in computer science. EOS The methodology and the conjecture are verified by applications to the well-known logistic equation, a forced memristive circuit and the Lorenz system.	Computational results show that the canonical duality theory can be used to identify chaotic systems and to obtain realistic global optimal solutions in nonlinear dynamical systems.
doc	Cosmological homogeneity scale estimates are dressed EOS We investigate number count statistics as measures for transition to homogeneity of the matter distribution in the Universe and analyse how such statistics might be `dressed' by the assumed survey selection function. EOS Since the estimated survey selection function -- which ideally accounts for selection bias in the observed distribution -- is degenerate with the estimated underlying distribution of galaxies, the ability to identify the correct survey selection function is of importance for obtaining reliable estimates for clustering statistics.	Selection functions of existing galaxy catalogues are modelled from data to resemble the redshift distribution and mean density of the observed galaxies.
doc	Sparse, guided feature connections in an Abstract Deep Network EOS We present a technique for developing a network of re-used features, where the topology is formed using a coarse learning method, that allows gradient-descent fine tuning, known as an Abstract Deep Network (ADN). EOS New features are built based on observed co-occurrences, and the network is maintained using a selection process related to evolutionary algorithms. EOS This allows coarse ex- ploration of the problem space, effective for irregular domains, while gradient descent allows pre- cise solutions.	Accuracy on standard UCI and Protein-Structure Prediction problems is comparable with benchmark SVM and optimized GBML approaches, and shows scalability for addressing large problems.
doc	Local Distance Indicators EOS A summary is given of the calibration of the Cepheid scale required in the derivation of distances from observations at V and I, as in the HST work on extragalactic Cepheids. EOS There is some evidence that a small metallicity correction may be necessary in deriving distances in this way.	The evidence for this comes both from observations of Cepheids of different metallicities and from a comparison of the LMC distance modulus derived from Cepheids and that derived by other methods.
doc	The Area and Population of Cities: New Insights from a Different Perspective on Cities EOS The distribution of the population of cities has attracted a great deal of attention, in part because it sharply constrains models of local growth. EOS However, to this day, there is no consensus on the distribution below the very upper tail, because available data need to rely on the "legal" rather than "economic" definition of cities for medium and small cities. EOS To remedy this difficulty, in this work we construct cities "from the bottom up" by clustering populated areas obtained from high-resolution data. EOS This method allows us to investigate the population and area of cities for urban agglomerations of all sizes using clustering methods from percolation theory.	We find that Zipf's law (a power law with exponent close to 1) for population holds for cities as small as 12,000 inhabitants in the USA and 5,000 inhabitants in Great Britain.
doc	Joint description of the e+e- annihilation into both four-pion channels EOS The e+e- --> pi+pi-pi0pi0 reaction cross section as a function of the incident energy is calculated using a model that is an extension of our recently published model of the e+e- annihilation into four charged pions. EOS The latter considered the intermediate states with the pi, rho, and a_1 mesons and fixed the mixing angle of the a_1-rho-pi Lagrangian and other parameters by fitting the cross section data. EOS Here we supplement the original intermediate states with those containing omega(782) and h_1(1170), but keep unchanged the values of those parameters that enter both charged and mixed channel calculations.	The inclusion of omega is vital for obtaining a good fit to the cross section data, while the intermediate states with h_1 further improve it.

EOS However how synfire chains coexist in one network remains to be elucidated. EOS We have studied the activity of a layered associative network of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neurons in which connection we embed memory patterns by the Hebbian Learning. EOS We analyzed their activity by the Fokker-Planck method. EOS In our previous report, when a half of neurons belongs to each memory pattern (memory pattern rate _EQN_), the temporal profiles of the network activity is split into temporally clustered groups called sublattices under certain input conditions. EOS In this study, we show that when the network is sparsely connected (_EQN_), synchronous firings of the memory pattern are promoted.	On the contrary, the densely connected network (_EQN_) inhibit synchronous firings.
doc	The Cauchy problem for the 3D Navier - Stokes equations. New approach to the solution and its justification EOS Some known results regarding the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations were obtained by different authors. EOS Existence and smoothness of solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions have been known for a long time. EOS Leray showed that the Navier-Stokes equations in three space dimensions have a weak solution. EOS Scheffer and Shnirelman obtained weak solution of the Euler equations with compact support in spacetime. EOS Caffarelli, Kohn and Nirenberg improved Scheffer's results, and F.-H. EOS Lin simplified the proof of the results of J. EOS Leray. EOS Many problems and conjectures about behavior of weak solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations are described in the books of Bertozzi and Majda, Constantin or Lemari\'e-Rieusset. EOS Solutions of the Navier-Stokes and Euler equations with initial conditions (Cauchy problem) for 2D and 3D cases were obtained in the convergence series form by analytical iterative method using Fourier and Laplace transforms in paper _EQN_. EOS These solutions were received in a form of infinitely differentiable functions, and that allows us to analyze all aspects of the problem on a much deeper level and with more details. EOS Also such smooth solutions satisfy the conditions required in _EQN_ for the problem of Navier-Stokes equations. EOS For several combinations of problem parameters numerical results were obtained and presented as graphs _EQN_, _EQN_. EOS This paper describes detailed proof of convergence of the analitical iterative method for solution of the Cauchy problem for the 3D Navier - Stokes equations. EOS The convergence is shown for wide ranges of the problem's parameters. EOS Estimated formula for the border of convergence area of the iterative process in the space of system parameters is obtained.	Also we have provided justification of the analytical iterative method solution for Cauchy problem for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations.
doc	Repetitive resolutions over classical orders and finite dimensional algebras EOS Repetitiveness in projective and injective resolutions and its influence on homological dimensions are studied. EOS Some variations on the theme of repetitiveness are introduced, and it is shown that the corresponding invariants lead to very good -- and quite accessible -- upper bounds on various finitistic dimensions in terms of individual modules. EOS These invariants are the `repetition index' and the `syzygy type' of a module _EQN_ over an artinian ring _EQN_. EOS The repetition index measures the degree of repetitiveness among non-projective direct summands of the syzygies of _EQN_, while the syzygy type of _EQN_ measures the number of indecomposable modules among direct summands of the syzygies of _EQN_. EOS It is proved that if _EQN_ is a right _EQN_ -module which contains an isomorphic copy of _EQN_, then the left big finitistic dimension of _EQN_ is bounded above by the repetition index of _EQN_, which in turn is bounded above by the syzygy type of _EQN_. EOS The finite dimensional _EQN_ -algebras _EQN_, where _EQN_ is a classical order over a discrete valuation ring _EQN_ with uniformizing parameter _EQN_ and residue class field _EQN_, are investigated. EOS It is proved that, if _EQN_, then the global repetition index of _EQN_ is _EQN_ and all finitely generated _EQN_ -modules have finite syzygy type.	Various examples illustrating the results are presented.
doc	Median-Truncated Nonconvex Approach for Phase Retrieval with Outliers EOS This paper investigates the phase retrieval problem, which aims to recover a signal from the magnitudes of its linear measurements. EOS We develop statistically and computationally efficient algorithms for the situation when the measurements are corrupted by sparse outliers that can take arbitrary values. EOS We propose a novel approach to robustify the gradient descent algorithm by using the sample median as a guide for pruning spurious samples in initialization and local search. EOS Adopting the Poisson loss and the reshaped quadratic loss respectively, we obtain two algorithms termed median-TWF and median-RWF, both of which provably recover the signal from a near-optimal number of measurements when the measurement vectors are composed of i.i.d. EOS Gaussian entries, up to a logarithmic factor, even when a constant fraction of the measurements are adversarially corrupted. EOS We further show that both algorithms are stable in the presence of additional dense bounded noise.	Our analysis is accomplished by developing non-trivial concentration results of median-related quantities, which may be of independent interest.

doc	Do you trade with your friends or become friends with your trading partners? A case study in the G1 cryptocurrency EOS We study the interplay between social ties and financial transactions made through a recent cryptocurrency called _EQN_. EOS It has the particularity of combining the usual transaction record with a reliable network of identified users. EOS This gives the opportunity to observe exactly who sent money to whom over a social network. EOS This social network is a key piece of this cryptocurrency, which therefore puts much effort in ensuring that nodes correspond to unique, well identified, real living human users, linked together only if they met at least once in real world. EOS Using this data, we study how social ties impact the structure of transactions and conversely. EOS We show that users make transactions almost exclusively with people they are connected with in the social network.	Instead, they tend to build social connections with people they will never make transactions with.

doc	Inclination-angle of the outflow in IRAS 05553+1631: A method to correct the projection effect EOS A mapping study of IRAS 05553+1631 was performed with 12CO J=3-2 and 13CO J=2-1 lines observed by the KOSMA 3 m-telescope. EOS A core with a size of 0.65 pc and with a LTE mass of 120 M\odot was defined by the mapping with 13CO J=2-1 line. EOS We have identified a bipolar outflow with 12CO J=3-2. EOS For accuracy in the calculation of outflow parameters, overcoming the projection effect is important. EOS We propose a new method to directly calculate the inclination-angle \theta. EOS We establish two basic equations with the help of outflow contour diagram and finally obtain the "angle function" and the "angle equation" to derive \theta. EOS We apply our method to the outflow of IRAS 05553+1631, finding that \theta blue is 73\circ and \theta red is 78\circ. EOS Compared to the parameters initially estimated under an assumption of 45\circ inclination-angle, the newly derived parameters are changed with different factors. EOS For instance, the timescales for the blue and the red lobes are reduced by 0.31 and 0.21, respectively.	Larger influences apply to mechanical luminosity, driving force, and mass-loss rate.
doc	A Three Parsec-Scale Jet-Driven Outflow from Sgr A* EOS The compact radio source Sgr A* is coincident with a 4 million solar mass black hole at the dynamical center of the Galaxy and is surrounded by dense orbiting ionized and molecular gas. EOS We present high resolution radio continuum images of the central 3' and report a faint continuous linear structure centered on Sgr A* with a PA~60 degrees. EOS The extension of this feature appears to be terminated symmetrically by two linearly polarized structures at 8.4 GHz, ~75" from Sgr A*. EOS A number of weak blobs of radio emission with X-ray counterparts are detected along the axis of the linear structure. EOS The linear structure is best characterized by a mildly relativistic jet from Sgr A* with an outflow rate 10^-6 solar mass per year.	The near and far-sides of the jet are interacting with orbiting ionized and molecular gas over the last 1-3 hundred years and are responsible for a 2" hole, the "minicavity", characterized by disturbed kinematics, enhanced FeII/III line emission, and diffuse X-ray gas.
doc	Teaching Social Behavior through Human Reinforcement for Ad hoc Teamwork -The STAR Framework EOS As AI technology continues to develop, more and more agents will become capable of long term autonomy alongside people. EOS Thus, a recent line of research has studied the problem of teaching autonomous agents the concept of ethics and human social norms.	Most existing work considers the case of an individual agent attempting to learn a predefined set of rules.
doc	A framework for analyzing contagion in assortative banking networks EOS We introduce a probabilistic framework that represents stylized banking networks with the aim of predicting the size of contagion events. EOS Most previous work on random financial networks assumes independent connections between banks, whereas our framework explicitly allows for (dis)assortative edge probabilities (e.g., a tendency for small banks to link to large banks). EOS We analyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and find that the cascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge probabilities that converges to a fixed point. EOS We derive a cascade condition that characterizes whether or not an infinitesimal shock to the network can grow to a finite size cascade, in analogy to the basic reproduction number _EQN_ in epidemic modelling. EOS The cascade condition provides an easily computed measure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology. EOS Using the percolation theory for random networks we also derive an analytic formula for the frequency of global cascades. EOS Although the analytical methods are derived for infinite networks, we demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations the applicability of the results to finite-sized networks.	We show that edge-assortativity, the propensity of nodes to connect to similar nodes, can have a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the cascade condition.

doc	Properties of dust in early-type galaxies EOS We report optical extinction properties of dust for a sample of 26 early-type galaxies based on the analysis of their multicolour CCD observations. EOS The wavelength dependence of dust extinction for these galaxies is determined and the extinction curves are found to run parallel to the Galactic extinction curve, which implies that the properties of dust in the extragalactic environment are quite similar to those of the Milky Way.	For the sample galaxies, value of the parameter _EQN_, the ratio of total extinction in _EQN_ band to selective extinction in _EQN_ & _EQN_ bands, lies in the range 2.03 - 3.46 with an average of 3.02, compared to its canonical value of 3.1 for the Milky Way.

doc	The Borsuk-Ulam property for homotopy classes of selfmaps of surfaces of Euler characteristic zero EOS Let M and N be topological spaces such that M admits a free involution _EQN_. EOS A homotopy class _EQN_ _EQN_ [M, N ] is said to have the Borsuk-Ulam property with respect to _EQN_ if for every representative map f: M _EQN_ N of _EQN_, there exists a point x _EQN_ M such that f (_EQN_ (x)) = f (x). EOS In the case where M is a compact, connected manifold without boundary and N is a compact, connected surface without boundary different from the 2-sphere and the real projective plane, we formulate this property in terms of the pure and full 2-string braid groups of N, and of the fundamental groups of M and the orbit space of M with respect to the action of _EQN_. EOS If M = N is either the 2-torus T^2 or the Klein bottle K^2, we then solve the problem of deciding which homotopy classes of [M, M ] have the Borsuk-Ulam property. EOS First, if _EQN_: T^2 _EQN_ T^2 is a free involution that preserves orientation, we show that no homotopy class of [T^2, T^2 ] has the Borsuk-Ulam property with respect to _EQN_.	Secondly, we prove that up to a certain equivalence relation, there is only one class of free involutions _EQN_: T^2 _EQN_ T^2 that reverse orientation, and for such involutions, we classify the homotopy classes in [T^2, T^2 ] that have the Borsuk-Ulam property with respect to _EQN_ in terms of the induced homomorphism on the fundamental group.
doc	Internal conversion of the low energy _EQN_ Th isomer in the Thorium anion EOS A process of the decay of the anomalously low lying nuclear isomer _EQN_ Th _EQN_ eV) in the Thorium anion (Th _EQN_) via the internal conversion (IC) channel is studied. EOS We show that the half life of the nuclear isomer in the _EQN_ ground state and in the _EQN_ excited state of Th _EQN_ is _EQN_ and _EQN_ times bigger than in the _EQN_ ground state of the Th atom. EOS The IC probabilities in the anion decreases despite the decay via the additional _EQN_ or _EQN_ electrons.	This counterintuitive result is a consequence: a) of a decrease in the amplitudes of the _EQN_ and _EQN_ wave functions near the nucleus due to an increase in their diffuseness of upon the addition of extra electron, b) of mutual compensation in the IC probability due to a kinematic factor, which depends on the energy of the conversion electron in the continuum as _EQN_, and the _EQN_ growth of the amplitudes of the electron wave functions.

From the period analysis and light curve shape of over 3000 candidates 785 RR Lyrae have been identified of which 188 are previously unknown.
doc	WIMPonium EOS We explore the possibility that weakly interacting dark matter can form bound states - WIMPonium. EOS Such states are expected in a wide class of models of particle dark matter, including some limits of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. EOS We examine the conditions under which we expect bound states to occur, and use analogues of NRQCD applied to heavy quarkonia to provide estimates for their properties, including couplings to the Standard Model.	We further find that it may be possible to produce WIMPonium at the LHC, and explore the properties of the WIMP that can be inferred from measurements of the WIMPonium states.
doc	Gravitational Corner Conditions in Holography EOS Contrary to popular belief, asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions of gravitational theories cannot be obtained by taking initial data (satisfying the constraints) on a spacelike surface, and choosing an arbitrary conformal metric on the timelike boundary at infinity. EOS There are an infinite number of corner conditions that also must be satisfied where the initial data surface hits the boundary. EOS These are well known to mathematical relativists, but to make them more widely known we give a simple explanation of why these conditions exist and discuss some of their consequences. EOS An example is given which illustrates their power.	Some implications for holography are also mentioned.
doc	Decoupling with random diagonal unitaries EOS We investigate decoupling, one of the most important primitives in quantum Shannon theory, by replacing the uniformly distributed random unitaries commonly used to achieve the protocol, with repeated applications of random unitaries diagonal in the Pauli- _EQN_ and - _EQN_ bases. EOS This strategy was recently shown to achieve an approximate unitary _EQN_ -design after a number of repetitions of the process, which implies that the strategy gradually achieves decoupling.	Here, we prove that even fewer repetitions of the process achieve decoupling at the same rate as that with the uniform ones, showing that rather imprecise approximations of unitary _EQN_ -designs are sufficient for decoupling.
doc	Towards a seismic model of the Delta Scuti star XX Pyxidis EOS Frequencies of 13 oscillation modes in the star XX Pyxidis (CD-24 7599) are accurately measured but for none of the modes the spherical harmonic degree l is known. EOS We present results of an attempt to construct the model whose low-l mode frequencies reproduce possibly close the observations. EOS Models are constrained by the mean photometric and spectroscopic data for the star. EOS However, the strongest constraint on the effective temperture is from the requirement that the modes excited in the star fall into the range of the modes driven by the opacity mechanism.	Our models are built with the standard stellar evolution code allowing no overshooting from the convective core.

The effect of the cloud virial ratio in head-on collisions EOS In a series of papers we investigate the effect of collisions between turbulent molecular clouds on their structure, evolution and star formation activity. EOS In this paper we look into the role of the clouds' initial virial ratios. EOS Three different scenarios were examined: both clouds initially bound, one cloud bound and one unbound, and both clouds initially unbound. EOS Models in which one or both clouds are bound generate filamentary structures aligned along the collision axis and discernible in position-position and position--velocity space.	If neither cloud is bound, no filaments result.
doc	Interedge magnetic coupling in transition-metal terminated graphene nanoribbons EOS The magnetic structures and interedge magnetic couplings of Fe, Co and Ni transition-metal terminated graphene nanoribbons with zigzag (ZGNR) and armchair (AGNR) edges are studied by first-principles calculations. EOS Fe-ZGNR is found to show antiferromagnetic (AF) coupling between two edges, while the interedge coupling of Co-ZGNR is ferromagnetic (FM). EOS For Fe-AGNRs and Co-AGNRs, increasing the interedge distance we follow oscillatory transitions from FM to AF coupling with a period of about 3.7 \AA.	The damped oscillatory behavior indicates a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida type interedge magnetic coupling and the oscillation period is determined by the critical spanning vector which connects two inequivalent Dirac points in the graphene Brillouin zone.

doc	From Rigid Supersymmetry to Twisted Holomorphic Theories EOS We study N=1 field theories with a U(1)_R symmetry on compact four-manifolds M. EOS Supersymmetry requires M to be a complex manifold. EOS The supersymmetric theory on M can be described in terms of conventional fields coupled to background supergravity, or in terms of twisted fields adapted to the complex geometry of M. EOS Many properties of the theory that are difficult to see in one formulation are simpler in the other one. EOS We use the twisted description to study the dependence of the partition function Z_M on the geometry of M, as well as coupling constants and background gauge fields, recovering and extending previous results.	We also indicate how to generalize our analysis to three-dimensional N=2 theories with a U(1)_R symmetry.
doc	Baryonic Dark Matter and the Diffuse Gamma Ray Background EOS We show that the baryonic gas content of the halo of our galaxy can be probed by performing a multipole expansion on the distribution of diffuse background gamma-ray emission.

doc	Thin Spectrum States in Superconductors EOS We show that finite size superconductors have a spectrum of states at extremely low energy, i.e. EOS inside the superconducting gap. EOS The presence of this thin spectrum is a generic feature and related to the fact that in a superconductor the global phase rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken. EOS For a strong coupling superconductor we find the spectrum by exactly solving the Lieb-Mattis type Hamiltonian onto which the problem maps.	One of the physical consequences of the presence of thin states is that they cause quantum decoherence in superconducting qubits of finite extent.
doc	Optimum control of broadband noise by barriers based on sonic crystals EOS It is demonstrated that sonic crystals (periodic structures of sound scatterers) can be used to design acoustic barriers that attenuate efficiently broadband noise. EOS Traffic noise is chosen here as an example in which our design procedure is applied. EOS The structures consist of cylindrical units containing rubber crumb, a sound absorbing material. EOS An optimization algorithm is developed to obtain the material distribution and the dimensions of the sonic crystal giving the best attenuation properties for this noise.	The good agreement found between predictions and measurements for a barrier (3m height) characterized in a transmission room gives strong support to our proposal.

doc	The stellar accretion origin of stellar population gradients in massive galaxies at large radii EOS We investigate the evolution of stellar population gradients from _EQN_ to _EQN_ in massive galaxies at large radii (_EQN_) using ten cosmological zoom simulations of halos with _EQN_. EOS The simulations follow metal cooling and enrichment from SNII, SNIa and AGB winds. EOS We explore the differential impact of an empirical model for galactic winds that reproduces the mass-metallicity relation and its evolution with redshift. EOS At larger radii the galaxies, for both models, become more dominated by stars accreted from satellite galaxies in major and minor mergers. EOS In the wind model, fewer stars are accreted, but they are significantly more metal poor resulting in steep global metallicity (_EQN_ dex/dex) and color (e.g. EOS _EQN_ dex/dex) gradients in agreement with observations. EOS In contrast, colour and metallicity gradients of the models without winds are inconsistent with observations. EOS Age gradients are in general mildly positive at _EQN_ (_EQN_ dex/dex) with significant differences between the models at higher redshift. EOS We demonstrate that for the wind model, stellar accretion is steepening existing in-situ metallicity gradients by about 0.2 dex by the present day and helps to match observed gradients of massive early-type galaxies at large radii.	Colour and metallicity gradients are significantly steeper for systems which have accreted stars in minor mergers, while galaxies with major mergers have relatively flat gradients, confirming previous results.

doc	Exact Solution to Terzaghi's Consolidation Equation EOS The application of the consolidation equation is based on Taylor's approximate solution alone. EOS The existence of the exact solution emerged from the analysis of the logical structure of d'Alambert's, Fourier' and Laplace's differential equations. EOS This led to a nonlinear equation - based on the properties of elastic waves and elastic functions - which is able to simulate excess pore pressure transmission in the soil. EOS The research is completed with the application of the solution obtained, thereby discovering that consolidation decay times may be calculated both through the construction of dissipation curves and through he analytical research of the time value satisfying the condition Delta u(z,t100) = 0.	Finally, decay times match the approximate solution eliminating in fact the introduction of Taylor's additional parameters.
doc	Long-time Asymptotic Behavior of the Fifth-order Modified KdV Equation in Low Regularity Spaces EOS Based on the nonlinear steepest descent method of Deift and Zhou for oscillatory Riemann--Hilbert problems and the Dbar approach, the long-time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the fifth-order modified Korteweg-de Vries equation on the line is studied in the case of initial conditions that belong to some weighted Sobolev spaces.	Using techniques in Fourier analysis and the idea of _EQN_ -method, we give its global well-posedness in lower regularity Sobolev spaces, and then obtain the asymptotic behavior in these spaces with weights.
doc	Secular variation of hemispheric phase differences in the solar cycle EOS We investigate the phase difference of the sunspot cycles in the two hemispheres and compare it with the latitudinal sunspot distribution. EOS If the north-south phase difference exhibits a long-term tendency, it should not be regarded as a stochastic phenomenon. EOS We use datasets of historical sunspot records and drawings made by Staudacher, Hamilton, Gimingham, Carrington, Spouml; EOS rer, and Greenwich observers, as well as the sunspot activity during the Maunder minimum reconstructed by Ribes and Nesme-Ribes. EOS We employ cross-recurrence plots to analyse north-south phase differences. EOS We show that during the last 300 years, the persistence of phase-leading in one of the hemispheres exhibits a secular variation.	Changes from one hemisphere to the other leading in phase were registered near 1928 and 1968 as well as two historical ones near 1783 and 1875.
doc	Sharp connections between Berry-Esseen characteristics and Edgeworth expansions for stationary processes EOS Given a weakly dependent stationary process, we describe the transition between a Berry-Esseen bound and a second order Edgeworth expansion in terms of the Berry-Esseen characteristic. EOS This characteristic is sharp: We show that Edgeworth expansions are valid if and only if the Berry-Esseen characteristic is of a certain magnitude. EOS If this is not the case, we still get an optimal Berry-Esseen bound, thus describing the exact transition.	We also obtain (fractional) expansions given _EQN_ moments, where a similar transition occurs.
doc	R\'enyi entropies of generic thermodynamic macrostates in integrable systems EOS We study the behaviour of R\'enyi entropies in a generic thermodynamic macrostate of an integrable model.

doc	The formation epoch of massive ellipticals, as traced by radio galaxies EOS I review the current status of an on-going investigation into the stellar and dynamical ages of the oldest known galaxies at redshifts greater than 1. EOS The spectroscopic data, when compared with the predictions of a range of recent evolutionary synthesis models, continue to indicate that the oldest galaxies at z = 1.5 are already at least 3 Gyr old. EOS Moreover, comparison with new models which incorporate chemical evolution, suggests that this result may be less sensitive to the assumed metallicity than was previously suspected.	Such ages should therefore be taken seriously as constraints both on theories of galaxy formation and on cosmological models.
doc	Quenched fractions in the IllustrisTNG simulations: comparison with observations and other theoretical models EOS We make an in-depth comparison of the IllustrisTNG simulations with observational data on the quenched fractions of central and satellite galaxies, for _EQN_ at _EQN_. EOS We study how analysis methodologies and observational effects impact this comparison. EOS This includes measurement choices -- aperture, quenched definition, star formation rate (SFR) indicator timescale -- as well as observational uncertainties and sample selection issues: projection effects, satellite/central misclassification, and host mass distribution sampling. EOS The definition used to separate quenched and star-forming galaxies produces differences of up to 70 (30) _EQN_ for centrals (satellites) _EQN_.	Increasing the aperture within which SFR is measured can suppress the quenched fractions by up to _EQN_, particularly at _EQN_.
doc	Supersymmetric Effects in Deep Inelastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering EOS We compute the supersymmetric (SUSY) contributions to neutrino (antineutrino)-nucleus deep inelastic scattering in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). EOS We consider the ratio of neutral current to charged current cross sections, _EQN_ and _EQN_, and compare with the deviations of these quantities from the Standard Model predictions implied by the recent NuTeV measurement. EOS After performing a model-independent analysis, we find that SUSY loop corrections generally have the opposite sign from the NuTeV anomaly. EOS We discuss one scenario in which a right-sign effect arises, and show that it is ruled out by other precision data.	We also study for R parity-violating (RPV) contributions.
doc	Evaluating gambles using dynamics EOS Gambles are random variables that model possible changes in monetary wealth. EOS Classic decision theory transforms money into utility through a utility function and defines the value of a gamble as the expectation value of utility changes. EOS Utility functions aim to capture individual psychological characteristics, but their generality limits predictive power. EOS Expectation value maximizers are defined as rational in economics, but expectation values are only meaningful in the presence of ensembles or in systems with ergodic properties, whereas decision-makers have no access to ensembles and the variables representing wealth in the usual growth models do not have the relevant ergodic properties. EOS Simultaneously addressing the shortcomings of utility and those of expectations, we propose to evaluate gambles by averaging wealth growth over time. EOS No utility function is needed, but a dynamic must be specified to compute time averages. EOS Linear and logarithmic "utility functions" appear as transformations that generate ergodic observables for purely additive and purely multiplicative dynamics, respectively. EOS We highlight inconsistencies throughout the development of decision theory, whose correction clarifies that our perspective is legitimate.	These invalidate a commonly cited argument for bounded utility functions.
doc	Landau electron in a rotating environment: a general factorization of time evolution EOS For the Landau problem with a rotating magnetic field and a potential in the (changing) direction of the field, we derive a general factorization of the time evolution operator that includes the adiabatic factorization as a special case. EOS We assume that the direction of the magnetic field changes with time in a general way, so the Heisenberg equations of motion cannot be solved by quadrature. EOS Also, the potential is assumed to be of a general form. EOS We use the rotation operator associated with the solid angle Berry phase to transform the problem to a rotating reference frame that follows the direction of the magnetic field. EOS In the rotating reference frame, we derive a natural factorization of the time evolution operator by recognizing the crucial role played by a gauge transformation. EOS The major complexity of the problem arises from the coupling between motion in the direction of the magnetic field and motion perpendicular to the field. EOS In the factorization, this complexity is consolidated into a single operator that approaches the identity operator when the potential confines the particle sufficiently close to a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. EOS The structure of this operator is clarified by deriving an expression for its generating Hamiltonian. EOS The magnetic translation is the most notable physical consequence in the adiabatic limit.	This and the non-adiabatic effects are studied as consequences of the general factorization.
doc	Instability of Supersonic Cold Streams Feeding Galaxies III: Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in Three Dimensions EOS We study the effects of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) on the cold streams that feed high-redshift galaxies through their hot haloes, generalizing our earlier analyses of a 2D slab to a 3D cylinder, but still limiting our analysis to the adiabatic case with no gravity. EOS We combine analytic modeling and numerical simulations in the linear and non-linear regimes. EOS For subsonic or transonic streams with respect to the halo sound speed, the instability in 3D is qualitatively similar to 2D, but progresses at a faster pace.	For supersonic streams, the instability grows much faster in 3D and can be qualitatively different due to azimuthal modes, which introduce a strong dependence on the initial width of the stream-background interface.

doc	Multimodal Dual Attention Memory for Video Story Question Answering EOS We propose a video story question-answering (QA) architecture, Multimodal Dual Attention Memory (MDAM). EOS The key idea is to use a dual attention mechanism with late fusion. EOS MDAM uses self-attention to learn the latent concepts in scene frames and captions. EOS Given a question, MDAM uses the second attention over these latent concepts. EOS Multimodal fusion is performed after the dual attention processes (late fusion). EOS Using this processing pipeline, MDAM learns to infer a high-level vision-language joint representation from an abstraction of the full video content.	We evaluate MDAM on PororoQA and MovieQA datasets which have large-scale QA annotations on cartoon videos and movies, respectively.
doc	Holography in asymptotically flat space-times and the BMS group EOS In a previous paper (hep-th/0306142) we have started to explore the holographic principle in the case of asymptotically flat space-times and analyzed in particular different aspects of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, namely the asymptotic symmetry group of any asymptotically flat space-time. EOS We continue this investigation in this paper. EOS Having in mind a S-matrix approach with future and past null infinity playing the role of holographic screens on which the BMS group acts, we connect the IR sectors of the gravitational field with the representation theory of the BMS group. EOS We analyze the (complicated) mapping between bulk and boundary symmetries pointing out differences with respect to the AdS/CFT set up. EOS Finally we construct a BMS phase space and a free hamiltonian for fields transforming w.r.t BMS representations.	The last step is supposed to be an explorative investigation of the boundary data living on the degenerate null manifold at infinity.
doc	Microscopic magnetic structuring of a spin-wave waveguide by ion implantation in a Ni(81)Fe(19) layer EOS We investigate the spin-wave excitation in microscopic waveguides fabricated by localized Cr+ ion implantation in a ferromagnetic Ni(81)Fe(19) film. EOS We demonstrate that spin-wave waveguides can be conveniently made by this technique. EOS The magnetic patterning technique yields an increased damping and a reduction in saturation magnetization in the implanted regions that can be extracted from Brillouin light scattering measurements of the spin-wave excitation spectra.	Furthermore, the waveguide performance as well as the internal field of the waveguide depend on the doping fluence.
doc	2*2 random matrix ensembles with reduced symmetry: From Hermitian to PT-symmetric matrices EOS A possibly fruitful extension of conventional random matrix ensembles is proposed by imposing symmetry constraints on conventional Hermitian matrices or parity-time- (PT-) symmetric matrices. EOS To illustrate the main idea, we first study 2*2 complex Hermitian matrix ensembles with O(2) invariant constraints, yielding novel level-spacing statistics such as singular distributions, half-Gaussian distribution, distributions interpolating between GOE (Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble) distribution and half Gaussian distributions, as well as gapped-GOE distribution.	Such a symmetry-reduction strategy is then used to explore 2*2 PT-symmetric matrix ensembles with real eigenvalues.
doc	Splashback radius of nonspherical dark matter halos from cosmic density and velocity fields EOS We investigate the splashback features of dark-matter halos based on cosmic density and velocity fields. EOS Besides the density correlation function binned by the halo orientation angle which was used in the literature, we introduce, for the first time, the corresponding velocity statistic, alignment momentum correlation function, to take into account the asphericity of halos. EOS Using large-volume, high-resolution N-body simulations, we measure the alignment statistics of density and velocity. EOS On halo scales, _EQN_, we detect a sharp steepening in the momentum correlation associated with the physical halo boundary, or the splashback feature, which is found more prominent than in the density correlation. EOS We also find that the splashback radius determined from the density correlation becomes _EQN_ smaller than that from the momentum correlation, with their correlation coefficient being 0.605.	Moreover, the orientation-dependent splashback feature due to halo asphericity is measured when the density profile is determined by dark-matter particles, which can be used as a test of collisional CDM since the halo shape is predicted to be rounder in such a model.
doc	Thermal decay of the Coulomb blockade oscillations EOS We study transport properties and the charge quantization phenomenon in a small metallic island connected to the leads through two quantum point contacts (QPCs). EOS The linear conductance is calculated perturbatively with respect to weak tunneling and weak backscattering at QPCs as a function of the temperature _EQN_ and gate voltage. EOS The conductance shows Coulomb blockade (CB) oscillations as a function of the gate voltage that decay with the temperature as a result of thermally activated fluctuations of the charge in the island. EOS The regimes of quantum, _EQN_, and thermal, _EQN_, fluctuations are considered, where _EQN_ is the charging energy of an isolated island. EOS Our predictions for CB oscillations in the quantum regime coincide with previous findings in [A. EOS Furusaki and K. EOS A. EOS Matveev, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS B 52, 16676 (1995)]. EOS In the thermal regime the visibility of Coulomb blockade oscillations decays with the temperature as _EQN_, where the exponential dependence originates from the thermal averaging over the instant charge fluctuations, while the prefactor has a quantum origin.	This dependence does not depend on the strength of couplings to the leads.
doc	Performance of Quantum Key Distribution Protocol with Dual-Rail Displaced Photon States EOS We propose a scheme for quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol with dual-rail displaced photon states. EOS Displaced single photon states carry bit value of code which may be extracted while coherent states carry nothing and they only provide inconclusive outcome. EOS Developed QKD protocol works with experimental attendant noise to observe presence of malicious Eve. EOS Pulses with large amplitudes unlike conventional QKD relying on faint laser pulses are used that may approximate it to standard telecommunication communication and may show resistance to eavesdropping even in settings with high attenuation. EOS Information leakage to the eavesdropper is determined from comparison of output distribution of the outcomes with ideal one that is defined by two additional inaccessible to nobody, saving for who sends the pulses, parameters.	Robustness to some possible eavesdropping attacks is shown.

doc	Simultaneous Estimation of Time Delays and Quasar Structure EOS We expand our Bayesian Monte Carlo method for analyzing the light curves of gravitationally lensed quasars to simultaneously estimate time delays and quasar structure including their mutual uncertainties. EOS We apply the method to HE1104-1805 and QJ0158-4325, two doubly-imaged quasars with microlensing and intrinsic variability on comparable time scales.	For HE1104-1805 the resulting time delay of (Delta t_AB) = t_A - t_B = 162.2 -5.9/+6.3 days and accretion disk size estimate of log(r_s/cm) = 15.7 -0.5/+0.4 at 0.2 micron in the rest frame are consistent with earlier estimates but suggest that existing methods for estimating time delays in the presence of microlensing underestimate the uncertainties.

doc	Unidirectional planar Hall voltages induced by surface acoustic waves in ferromagnetic thin films EOS The electromotive forces induced by surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are investigated in ferromagnetic thin films. EOS CoFeB thin films deposited on LiNbO _EQN_ substrates are patterned into Hall-bars to study the acoustoelectric transport properties of the device. EOS The longitudinal and transverse dc voltages that develop in the Hall bars, which are parallel and orthogonal to the flow of the SAW, respectively, are measured under application of an in-plane magnetic field. EOS The longitudinal voltage scales linearly with the SAW power and reverses its polarity upon changing the direction to which the SAW propagates, suggesting generation of a dc acoustic current via the SAW excitation. EOS The magnetic field has little influence on the acoustic current. EOS In contrast, the SAW induced transverse voltage shows significant dependence on the relative angle between the magnetic field and the SAW propagation direction.	Such field angle dependent voltage resembles that of the planar Hall voltage induced by electric current.

doc	Chaos control in the fractional order logistic map via impulses EOS In this paper the chaos control in the discrete logistic map of fractional order is obtained with an impulsive control algorithm. EOS The underlying discrete initial value problem of fractional order is considered in terms of Caputo delta fractional difference. EOS Every _EQN_ steps, the state variable is instantly modified with the same impulse value, chosen from a bifurcation diagram versus impulse. EOS It is shown that the solution of the impulsive control is bounded. EOS The numerical results are verified via time series, histograms, and the 0-1 test.	Several examples are considered
doc	Classical Dynamics of Quantum Numbers with Arrow of Time EOS We study a quantum theory with complex time parameter and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian structure. EOS In this theory, the real part of the complex time is equal to `usual' physical time, whereas the imaginary one is proportional to inverse absolute temperature of the system. EOS Then, the Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian coincides with conventional operator of energy;	the anti-Hermitian part, which is taken as a symmetry operator, defines decay parameters of the theory.
doc	The Pan-STARRS1 Database and Data Products EOS This paper describes the organization of the database and the catalog data products from the Pan-STARRS1 _EQN_ Steradian Survey.

EOS The database is described in detail, including the construction of the database, the provenance of the data, the schema, and how the database tables are related.	Examples of queries for a range of science goals are included.

doc	Power Pooling Operators and Confidence Learning for Semi-Supervised Sound Event Detection EOS In recent years, the involvement of synthetic strongly labeled data,weakly labeled data and unlabeled data has drawn much research attentionin semi-supervised sound event detection (SSED).

EOS Such models have shown its effectiveness in SSED.	However, probabilities are poorly calibrated confidence estimates, and samples with low probabilities are ignored.

EOS It was conceived to measure outdoor wind speeds, and for airspeed monitoring in wind tunnels and other indoor uses.	It works at a constant, low temperature of approximately 90 _EQN_ C, so that an independent measurement of the air temperature is required to give a correct speed reading.
doc	A new sample of bright galaxy pairs in UZC EOS We present a new sample of bright galaxy pairs extracted applying an objective selection code to UZC catalog.The sample is volume limited to M _EQN_ = -18.9 +5 log _EQN_ and contains 89 galaxy pairs.We analyze the kinematical, morphological and photometrical properties of galaxies belonging to this sample. EOS We show that velocity separation, _EQN_, between pair members is significantly lower in spiral type (S+S) pairs than in early-type (E+E) and mixed (E+S) pairs.This indicates that truly isolated galaxy pairs are more likely to be found among S+S pairs. EOS We show that ellipticals are rare and underluminous in B and that late spirals (T _EQN_ 4) are overluminous. EOS We confirm that the formation of bright ellipticals is a phenomenon linked to group/cluster environment, while galaxy-galaxy interaction may enhance blue luminosity of disk galaxies through SF phenomena.	This last statement is supported by the presence of strong FIR emission from early spirals in this sample and by the high frequency of AGN/SB phenomenon, revealed mainly in pairs of low relative radial velocity separation and showing signs of interaction.
doc	Tensor calculus in spherical coordinates using Jacobi polynomials, Part-II: Implementation and Examples EOS We present a simulation code which can solve broad ranges of partial differential equations in a full sphere. EOS The code expands tensorial variables in a spectral series of spin-weighted spherical harmonics in the angular directions and a scaled Jacobi polynomial basis in the radial direction, as described in Part-I. EOS Nonlinear terms are calculated by transforming from the coefficients in the spectral series to the value of each quantity on the physical grid, where it is easy to calculate products and perform other local operations. EOS The expansion makes it straightforward to solve equations in tensor form (i.e., without decomposition into scalars). EOS We propose and study several unit tests which demonstrate the code can accurately solve linear problems, implement boundary conditions, and transform between spectral and physical space. EOS We then run a series of benchmark problems proposed in Marti et al (2014), implementing the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic equations. EOS We are able to calculate more accurate solutions than reported in Marti et al 2014 by running at higher spatial resolution and using a higher-order timestepping scheme.	We find the rotating convection and convective dynamo benchmark problems depend sensitively on details of timestepping and data analysis.
doc	Clues to Outflows: Polarization of IRAS-Selected QSOs EOS Broad-band polarimetry and spectropolarimetry of a complete sample of 18 luminous AGNs (Lbol > 10^11.5 Lsun), selected in an orientation-independent way by warm infrared flux, shows that an orientation-dust-covering Unified Scheme like that successfully explored for the lower luminosity Seyfert galaxies applies to the luminous QSOs. EOS Broad emission lines and continuum seen in polarized (scattered) light show that hyperluminous infrared galaxies contain buried QSO nuclei and are therefore the `missing' QSO 2s -- the high-luminosity analogs of Seyfert 2 galaxies like NGC1068. EOS Most of the QSOs show significant polarization and reddening. EOS Three are `classical' low-ionization BALQSOs, and several others have narrower, blueshifted, low-ionization absorption. EOS These properties are to be compared with those of the UV-optically selected QSOs, of which only ~1% show low-ionization BALs, and only the BALQSOs show significant polarization.	Outflows are therefore much more common than previously suspected.
doc	Rainbow matchings in bipartite multigraphs EOS Suppose that _EQN_ is a non-negative integer and a bipartite multigraph _EQN_ is the union of _EQN_ matchings _EQN_, each of size _EQN_.

doc	On Global Stability of Financial Networks EOS The recent financial crisis have generated renewed interests in fragilities of global financial networks among economists and regulatory authorities. EOS In particular, a potential vulnerability of the financial networks is the "financial contagion" process in which insolvencies of individual entities propagate through the "web of dependencies" to affect the entire system. EOS In this paper, we formalize an extension of a financial network model originally proposed by Nier et al for scenarios such as the OTC derivatives market, define a suitable global stability measure for this model, and perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of this stability measure over more than 700,000 combinations of networks types and parameter combinations.	Based on our evaluations, we discover many interesting implications of our evaluations of this stability measure, and derive topological properties and parameters combinations that may be used to flag the network as a possible fragile network.
doc	Graphical Models for Game Theory EOS In this work, we introduce graphical modelsfor multi-player game theory, and give powerful algorithms for computing their Nash equilibria in certain cases. EOS An n-player game is given by an undirected graph on n nodes and a set of n local matrices. EOS The interpretation is that the payoff to player i is determined entirely by the actions of player i and his neighbors in the graph, and thus the payoff matrix to player i is indexed only by these players. EOS We thus view the global n-player game as being composed of interacting local games, each involving many fewer players. EOS Each player's action may have global impact, but it occurs through the propagation of local influences.Our main technical result is an efficient algorithm for computing Nash equilibria when the underlying graph is a tree (or can be turned into a tree with few node mergings). EOS The algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the representation (the graph and theassociated local game matrices), and comes in two related but distinct flavors. EOS The first version involves an approximation step, and computes a representation of all approximate Nash equilibria (of which there may be an exponential number in general).	The second version allows the exact computation of Nash equilibria at the expense of weakened complexity bounds.
doc	Material-based Non-neural Analogues of Lateral Inhibition: A Multi-agent Approach EOS Lateral Inhibition (LI) phenomena occur in a wide range of sensory modalities and are most famously described in the human visual system. EOS In LI the activity of a stimulated neuron is itself excited and suppresses the activity of its local neighbours via inhibitory connections, increasing the contrast between spatial environmental stimuli. EOS Simple or- ganisms, such as the single-celled slime mould Physarum polycephalum possess no neural tissue yet, despite this, are known to exhibit complex computational behaviour. EOS Could simple organisms such as slime mould approximate LI without recourse to neural tissue? EOS We describe a model whereby LI can emerge without explicit inhibitory wiring, using only bulk transport effects. EOS We use a multi-agent virtual material model of slime mould to reproduce the characteristic contrast amplification response of LI using excitation via attractant stimuli.	Restoration of baseline activ- ity occurs when the stimuli are removed.
doc	The Detection of Crystalline Silicates in Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies EOS Silicates are an important component of interstellar dust and the structure of these grains -- amorphous versus crystalline -- is sensitive to the local physical conditions. EOS We have studied the infrared spectra of a sample of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. EOS Here, we report the discovery of weak, narrow absorption features at 11, 16, 19, 23, and 28 microns, characteristic of crystalline silicates, superimposed on the broad absorption bands at 10 and 18 microns due to amorphous silicates in a subset of this sample. EOS These features betray the presence of forsterite (Mg_2SiO_4), the magnesium-rich end member of the olivines.	Previously, crystalline silicates have only been observed in circumstellar environments.
doc	Greybody factors of black holes in dRGT massive gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics EOS In the context of the dRGT massive gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics, we present new dRGT black hole solutions. EOS Together with the thermodynamical properties of the solutions, we study the greybody factor of the corresponding black hole solution. EOS To this end, we compute the rigorous bound on the greybody factor for the obtained dRGT black holes. EOS The obtained results are graphically represented for different values of the theory's physical parameters.	Our analysis shows that the charged dRGT black holes of nonlinear electrodynamics evaporate quicker than the charged dRGT black holes originated from linear electrodynamics.
doc	Trouble shooting for covariance fitting in highly correlated data EOS We report a possible solution to the trouble that the covariance fitting fails when the data is highly correlated and the covariance matrix has small eigenvalues. EOS As an example, we choose the data analysis of highly correlated _EQN_ data on the basis of the SU(2) staggered chiral perturbation theory. EOS Basically, the essence of the problem is that we do not have an accurate fitting function so that we cannot fit the highly correlated and precise data. EOS When some eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are small, even a tiny error of fitting function can produce large chi-square and spoil the fitting procedure.	We have applied a number of prescriptions available in the market such as diagonal approximation and cutoff method.
doc	Interplay between Kondo and Andreev-Josephson effects in a quantum dot coupled to one normal and two superconducting leads EOS We study low-energy transport through a quantum dot coupled to one normal and two superconducting (SC) leads in a junction of Y-shape. EOS In this geometry a crossover between Kondo dominated and Cooper-pairing dominated states occurs by tuning the parameters such as the quantized energy level of the dot and the Josephson phase, which induces a supercurrent flowing between the two SC leads through the dot. EOS Furthermore, Andreev scattering takes place at the interface between the dot and normal lead. EOS The low-lying energy states of this system can be described by a local Fermi-liquid theory for interacting Bogoliubov particles. EOS In a description based on an Anderson impurity model we calculate transport coefficients, renormalized parameters and spectral function, using Wilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG) approach, in the limit of large SC gap. EOS Our results demonstrate how the Andreev resonance level approaches the Fermi level in the crossover region between Cooper-pairing singlet state and strong coupling situation as the impurity level or Josephson phase are varied. EOS The strong coupling situation shows a Kondo effect with a significantly renormalized resonance width. EOS The crossover is smeared when the coupling between the dot and normal lead is large.	Furthermore, asymmetry in the Josephson junction suppresses the cancellations of the SC proximity for finite Josephson phase, and it favors the SC singlet state rather than the Kondo singlet.
doc	A self-sustaining nonlinear dynamo process in Keplerian shear flows EOS A three-dimensional nonlinear dynamo process is identified in rotating plane Couette flow in the Keplerian regime. EOS It is analogous to the hydrodynamic self-sustaining process in non-rotating shear flows and relies on the magneto-rotational instability of a toroidal magnetic field.	Steady nonlinear solutions are computed numerically for a wide range of magnetic Reynolds numbers but are restricted to low Reynolds numbers.
doc	Spectroscopic study of blue compact galaxies: I. The spectra EOS Blue compact galaxies are compact objects that are dominated by intense star formation. EOS Most of them have dramatically different properties compared to the Milky Way and many other nearby galaxies. EOS Using the IRAS, HI data, and optical spectra, we wanted to measure the current star formation rates, stellar components, metallicities, and star formation histories and evolution of a large blue compact galaxy sample.	We anticipate that our study will be useful as a benchmark for studies of emission line galaxies at high redshift.
doc	Classification of Extremely Red Objects in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field EOS In this paper we present a quantitative study of the classification of Extremely Red Objects (EROs). EOS The analysis is based on the multi-band spatial- and ground-based observations (HST/ACS- _EQN_, HST/NICMOS- _EQN_, VLT- _EQN_) in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF). EOS Over a total sky area of 5.50 arcmin _EQN_ in the UDF, we select 24 EROs with the color criterion _EQN_, corresponding to _EQN_, down to _EQN_. EOS We develop four methods to classify EROs into Old passively evolving Galaxies (OGs) and Dusty star-forming Galaxies (DGs), including _EQN_ vs. EOS _EQN_ color diagram, spectral energy distribution fitting method, Spitzer MIPS 24 _EQN_ m image matching, and nonparametric measure of galaxy morphology, and found that the classification results from these methods agree well. EOS Using these four classification methods, we classify our EROs sample into 6 OGs and 8 DGs to _EQN_, and 8 OGs and 16 DGs to _EQN_, respectively. EOS The fraction of DGs increases from 8/14 at _EQN_ to 16/24 at _EQN_. EOS To study the morphology of galaxies with its wavelength, we measure the central concentration and the Gini coefficient for the 24 EROs in our sample in HST/ACS- _EQN_ and HST/NICMOS- _EQN_ bands.	We find that the morphological parameters of galaxies in our sample depend on the wavelength of observation, which suggests that caution is necessary when comparing single wavelength band images of galaxies at a variety of redshifts.

As with any client-server model, the server should not make any assumption on the validity (sanity) of client-side transaction.
doc	Bistability of Cavity Magnon Polaritons EOS We report the first observation of the magnon-polariton bistability in a cavity magnonics system consisting of cavity photons strongly interacting with the magnons in a small yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere. EOS The bistable behaviors are emerged as sharp frequency switchings of the cavity magnon-polaritons (CMPs) and related to the transition between states with large and small number of polaritons. EOS In our experiment, we align, respectively, the  and  crystallographic axes of the YIG sphere parallel to the static magnetic field and find very different bistable behaviors (e.g., clockwise and counter-clockwise hysteresis loops) in these two cases.	The experimental results are well fitted and explained as being due to the Kerr nonlinearity with either positive or negative coefficient.

EOS Existing datasets or methods either use side information from original recommender systems (containing very few kinds of useful information) or utilize private knowledge base (KB).	In this paper, we present the first public linked KB dataset for recommender systems, named KB4Rec v1.0, which has linked three widely used RS datasets with the popular KB Freebase.
doc	The Solar Neutrino Problem after the first results from Kamland EOS The first results from the KamLAND experiment have provided confirmational evidence for the Large Mixing Angle (LMA) MSW solution to the solar neutrino problem. EOS We do a global analysis of solar and the recently announced KamLAND data (both rate and spectrum) and investigate its effect on the allowed region in the _EQN_ plane. EOS The best-fit from a combined analysis which uses the KamLAND rate plus global solar data comes at _EQN_ eV _EQN_ and _EQN_, very close to the global solar best-fit, leaving a large allowed region within the global solar LMA contour. EOS The inclusion of the KamLAND spectral data in the global fit gives a best-fit _EQN_ eV _EQN_ and _EQN_ and constrains the allowed areas within LMA, leaving essentially two allowed zones.	Maximal mixing though allowed by the KamLAND data alone is disfavored by the global solar data and remains disallowed at about _EQN_.

EOS.. EOS, V k, in such a way that every two distinct vertices in V i are at distance greater than i in G for every i, 1 _EQN_ i _EQN_ k. EOS Recently, Balogh, Kostochka and Liu proved that _EQN_ _EQN_ is not bounded in the class of subcubic graphs [Packing chromatic number of subcubic graphs, Discrete Math.	341 (2018), 474483], thus answering a question previously addressed in several papers.
doc	Single-Server Single-Message Online Private Information Retrieval with Side Information EOS In many practical settings, the user needs to retrieve information from a server in a periodic manner, over multiple rounds of communication. EOS In this paper, we discuss the setting in which this information needs to be retrieved privately, such that the identity of all the information retrieved until the current round is protected. EOS This setting can occur in practical situations in which the user needs to retrieve items from the server or a periodic basis, such that the privacy needs to be guaranteed for all the items been retrieved until the current round. EOS We refer to this setting as an ph online private information retrieval as the user does not know the identities of the future items that need to be retrieved from the server. EOS Following the previous line of work by Kadhe ph et al ~we assume that the user knows a random subset of _EQN_ messages in the database as a side information which are unknown to the server. EOS Focusing on scalar-linear settings, we characterize the ph per-round capacity, i.e., the maximum achievable download rate at each round, and present a coding scheme that achieves this capacity. EOS The key idea of our scheme is to utilize the data downloaded during the current round as a side information for the subsequent rounds.	We show for the setting with _EQN_ messages stored at the server, the per-round capacity of the scalar-linear setting is _EQN_ for round _EQN_ and _EQN_ for round _EQN_, provided that _EQN_ is a power of _EQN_.
doc	The Formation of the Hubble Sequence of Disk Galaxies: The Effects of Early Viscous Evolution EOS We investigate a model of disk galaxies whereby viscous evolution of the gaseous disk drives material inwards to form a proto-bulge. EOS We start from the standard picture of disk formation through the settling of gas into a dark halo potential well, with the disk initially coming into centrifugal equilibrium with detailed conservation of angular momentum. EOS We derive generic analytic solutions for the disk-halo system after adiabatic compression of the dark halo, with free choice of the input virialized dark halo density profile and of the specific angular momentum distribution. EOS We derive limits on the final density profile of the halo in the central regions. EOS Subsequent viscous evolution of the disk is modelled by a variation of the specific angular momentum distribution of the disk, providing analytic solutions to the final disk structure. EOS The assumption that the viscous evolution timescale and star formation timescale are similar leads to predictions of the properties of the stellar components. EOS Focusing on small `exponential' bulges, ones that may be formed through a disk instability, we investigate the relationship between the assumed initial conditions, such as halo `formation', or assembly, redshift _EQN_, spin parameter _EQN_, baryonic fraction _EQN_, and final disk properties such as global star formation timescale, gas fraction, and bulge-to-disk ratio.	We find that the present properties of disks, such as the scale length, are compatible with a higher initial formation redshift if the re-distribution by viscous evolution is included than if it is ignored.
doc	Cross-layer Optimization for Next Generation Wi-Fi EOS From the initial 1997 specification to the undergoing IEEE 802.11ac standardization, a leap in throughput has been observed with every new generation. EOS The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput, range, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. EOS This is quite a challenge considering all the work already done. EOS Cross-layer optimization of physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting exploration path for further enhancement. EOS During this thesis we have studied cross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac standard. EOS A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge between PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in collision-prone environments. EOS We have shown that some functionalities directly involved PHY and MAC layers. EOS An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC mechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such functionalities. EOS A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac specifications, has thus been implemented.	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for the IEEE 802.11ac standard.

EOS Designing strategies for the emptier that minimize backlog (i.e., the height of the fullest cup) is important for applications in processor scheduling, buffer management in networks, quality of service guarantees, and deamortization. EOS We prove that the greedy algorithm (i.e., the empty-from-fullest-cups algorithm) achieves backlog _EQN_ for any _EQN_. EOS This resolves a long-standing open problem for _EQN_, and is asymptotically optimal as long as _EQN_. EOS If the filler is an oblivious adversary, then we prove that there is a randomized emptying algorithm that achieve backlog _EQN_ with probability _EQN_ for _EQN_ steps.	This is known to be asymptotically optimal when _EQN_ is sufficiently large relative to _EQN_.

doc	Stable log surfaces, admissible covers, and canonical curves of genus 4 EOS We explicitly describe the KSBA/Hacking compactification of a moduli space of log surfaces of Picard rank 2. EOS The space parametrizes log pairs _EQN_ where _EQN_ is a degeneration of _EQN_ and _EQN_ is a degeneration of a curve of class _EQN_.	We prove that the compactified moduli space is a smooth Deligne--Mumford stack with 4 boundary components.
doc	Undecidability of a weak version of MSO+U EOS We prove the undecidability of MSO on _EQN_ -words extended with the second-order predicate _EQN_ which says that the distance between consecutive positions in a set _EQN_ is unbounded. EOS This is achieved by showing that adding _EQN_ to MSO gives a logic with the same expressive power as _EQN_, a logic on _EQN_ -words with undecidable satisfiability.	As a corollary, we prove that MSO on _EQN_ -words becomes undecidable if allowing to quantify over sets of positions that are ultimately periodic, i.e., sets _EQN_ such that for some positive integer _EQN_, ultimately either both or none of positions _EQN_ and _EQN_ belong to _EQN_.

doc	Adaptive scaling for soft-thresholding estimator EOS Soft-thresholding is a sparse modeling method that is typically applied to wavelet denoising in statistical signal processing and analysis. EOS It has a single parameter that controls a threshold level on wavelet coefficients and, simultaneously, amount of shrinkage for coefficients of un-removed components. EOS This parametrization is possible to cause excess shrinkage, thus, estimation bias at a sparse representation; EOS i.e. EOS there is a dilemma between sparsity and prediction accuracy.	To relax this problem, we considered to introduce positive scaling on soft-thresholding estimator, by which threshold level and amount of shrinkage are independently controlled.
doc	Photovoltaic effect in an electrically tunable van der Waals heterojunction EOS Semiconductor heterostructures form the cornerstone of many electronic and optoelectronic devices and are traditionally fabricated using epitaxial growth techniques. EOS More recently, heterostructures have also been obtained by vertical stacking of two-dimensional crystals, such as graphene and related two- dimensional materials. EOS These layered designer materials are held together by van der Waals forces and contain atomically sharp interfaces. EOS Here, we report on a type- II van der Waals heterojunction made of molybdenum disulfide and tungsten diselenide monolayers. EOS The junction is electrically tunable and under appropriate gate bias, an atomically thin diode is realized. EOS Upon optical illumination, charge transfer occurs across the planar interface and the device exhibits a photovoltaic effect.	Advances in large-scale production of two-dimensional crystals could thus lead to a new photovoltaic solar technology.

EOS While continuous progress is observed for theoretical physics in XVII-XIX centuries, modern physics contains many questions that have not been resolved despite many decades of discussion. EOS Based upon the analysis of works by the founders of the XX-century physics, the conclusion is made that the roots of the "eternal" questions by the XX-century theoretical physics lie in the philosophy used by its founders. EOS The conclusion is made about the need to use the ideas of philosophy that guided C.	Huygens, I.

EOS This structure from motion inequality relates space dimension, camera parameter dimension, the number of cameras and number points and global symmetry properties and provides a rigorous criterion for which reconstruction is not possible with probability 1. EOS Mathematically the inequality is based on Frobenius theorem which is a geometric incarnation of the fundamental theorem of linear algebra.	The paper also provides a general mathematical formalism for the structure from motion problem.
doc	Estimating Statistical Uncertainties of Internal Kinematics of Galaxies and Star Clusters Derived Using Full Spectrum Fitting EOS Pixel-space full spectrum fitting exploiting non-linear _EQN_ minimization became a ph de facto standard way of deriving internal kinematics from absorption line spectra of galaxies and star clusters. EOS However, reliable estimation of uncertainties for kinematic parameters remains a challenge and is usually addressed by running computationally expensive Monte-Carlo simulations. EOS Here we derive simple formulae for the radial velocity and velocity dispersion uncertainties based solely on the shape of a template spectrum used in the fitting procedure and signal-to-noise information.	Comparison with Monte-Carlo simulations provides perfect agreement for different templates, signal-to-noise ratios and velocity dispersion between 0.5 and 10 times of the instrumental spectral resolution.
doc	An investigation into inter- and intragenomic variations of graphic genomic signatures EOS We provide, on an extensive dataset and using several different distances, confirmation of the hypothesis that CGR patterns are preserved along a genomic DNA sequence, and are different for DNA sequences originating from genomes of different species. EOS This finding lends support to the theory that CGRs of genomic sequences can act as graphic genomic signatures. EOS In particular, we compare the CGR patterns of over five hundred different 150,000 bp genomic sequences originating from the genomes of six organisms, each belonging to one of the kingdoms of life: H.

doc	Characterizing Delay and Control Traffic of the Cellular MME with IoT Support EOS One of the main use cases for advanced cellular networks is represented by massive Internet-of-things (MIoT), i.e., an enormous number of IoT devices that transmit data toward the cellular network infrastructure. EOS To make cellular MIoT a reality, data transfer and control procedures specifically designed for the support of IoT are needed.	For this reason, 3GPP has introduced the Control Plane Cellular IoT optimization, which foresees a simplified bearer instantiation, with the Mobility Management Entity (MME) handling both control and data traffic.

This leads to a complete description of four- and six-dimensional Kaehler gradient Ricci solitons with constant scalar curvature.

We show that not only the super GZK events, but the "ankle" and all events above it can be accounted for.
doc	Extremal properties of conditional entropy and quantum discord for XXZ symmetric quantum states EOS For the XXZ subclass of symmetric two-qubit X states, we study the behavior of quantum conditional entropy S_ cond as a function of measurement angle \theta\in[0,\pi/2]. EOS Numerical calculations show that the function S_ cond (\theta) for X states can have at most one local extremum in the open interval from zero to \pi/2 (unimodality property). EOS If the extremum is a minimum the quantum discord displays region with variable (state-dependent) optimal measurement angle \theta^*.	Such \theta-regions (phases, fractions) are very tiny in the space of X state parameters.
doc	Low temperature correlation functions in integrable models: Derivation of the large distance and time asymptotics from the form factor expansion EOS We propose an approach to the problem of low but finite temperature dynamical correlation functions in integrable one-dimensional models with a spectral gap. EOS The approach is based on the analysis of the leading singularities of the operator matrix elements and is not model specific. EOS We discuss only models with well defined asymptotic states. EOS For such models the long time, large distance asymptotics of the correlation functions fall into two universality classes.	These classes differ primarily by whether the behavior of the two-particle S matrix at low momenta is diagonal or corresponds to pure reflection.

The plasmon injection scheme for loss compensation in negative index metamaterials is applied to the results from the imaging system, resulting in a perfect reconstruction of a previously unresolved image that demonstrates sub-diffraction-limit resolution.

doc	Photoprocesses in protoplanetary disks EOS Circumstellar disks are exposed to intense ultraviolet radiation from the young star. EOS In the inner disks, the UV radiation can be enhanced by more than seven orders of magnitude compared with the average interstellar field, resulting in a physical and chemical structure that resembles that of a dense photon-dominated region (PDR). EOS This intense UV field affects the chemistry, the vertical structure of the disk, and the gas temperature, especially in the surface layers of the disk. EOS The parameters which make disks different from traditional PDRs are discussed, including the shape of the UV radiation field, grain growth, the absence of PAHs, the gas/dust ratio and the presence of inner holes. EOS New photorates for selected species, including simple ions, are presented. EOS Also, a summary of available cross sections at Lyman alpha 1216 A is made. EOS Rates are computed for radiation fields with color temperatures ranging from 4000 to 30,000 K, and can be applied to a wide variety of astrophysical regions including exo-planetary atmospheres.	The importance of photoprocesses is illustrated for a number of representative disk models, including disk models with grain growth and settling.
doc	Visual Semantic Re-ranker for Text Spotting EOS Many current state-of-the-art methods for text recognition are based on purely local information and ignore the semantic correlation between text and its surrounding visual context. EOS In this paper, we propose a post-processing approach to improve the accuracy of text spotting by using the semantic relation between the text and the scene. EOS We initially rely on an off-the-shelf deep neural network that provides a series of text hypotheses for each input image. EOS These text hypotheses are then re-ranked using the semantic relatedness with the object in the image. EOS As a result of this combination, the performance of the original network is boosted with a very low computational cost.	The proposed framework can be used as a drop-in complement for any text-spotting algorithm that outputs a ranking of word hypotheses.
doc	A general method of estimating stellar astrophysical parameters from photometry EOS Applying photometric catalogs to the study of the population of the Galaxy is obscured by the impossibility to map directly photometric colors into astrophysical parameters. EOS Most of all-sky catalogs like ASCC or 2MASS are based upon broad-band photometric systems, and the use of broad photometric bands complicates the determination of the astrophysical parameters for individual stars. EOS This paper presents an algorithm for determining stellar astrophysical parameters (effective temperature, gravity and metallicity) from broad-band photometry even in the presence of interstellar reddening.	This method suits the combination of narrow bands as well.

doc	Graph-Valued Regression EOS Undirected graphical models encode in a graph _EQN_ the dependency structure of a random vector _EQN_. EOS In many applications, it is of interest to model _EQN_ given another random vector _EQN_ as input. EOS We refer to the problem of estimating the graph _EQN_ of _EQN_ conditioned on _EQN_ as ``graph-valued regression.'' In this paper, we propose a semiparametric method for estimating _EQN_ that builds a tree on the _EQN_ space just as in CART (classification and regression trees), but at each leaf of the tree estimates a graph. EOS We call the method ``Graph-optimized CART,'' or Go-CART.	We study the theoretical properties of Go-CART using dyadic partitioning trees, establishing oracle inequalities on risk minimization and tree partition consistency.
doc	Inferring High Quality Co-Travel Networks EOS Social networks provide a new perspective for enterprises to better understand their customers and have attracted substantial attention in industry. EOS However, inferring high quality customer social networks is a great challenge while there are no explicit customer relations in many traditional OLTP environments. EOS In this paper, we study this issue in the field of passenger transport and introduce a new member to the family of social networks, which is named Co-Travel Networks, consisting of passengers connected by their co-travel behaviors. EOS We propose a novel method to infer high quality co-travel networks of civil aviation passengers from their co-booking behaviors derived from the PNRs (Passenger Naming Records). EOS In our method, to accurately evaluate the strength of ties, we present a measure of Co-Journey Times to count the co-travel times of complete journeys between passengers. EOS We infer a high quality co-travel network based on a large encrypted PNR dataset and conduct a series of network analyses on it. EOS The experimental results show the effectiveness of our inferring method, as well as some special characteristics of co-travel networks, such as the sparsity and high aggregation, compared with other kinds of social networks. EOS It can be expected that such co-travel networks will greatly help the industry to better understand their passengers so as to improve their services.	More importantly, we contribute a special kind of social networks with high strength of ties generated from very close and high cost travel behaviors, for further scientific researches on human travel behaviors, group travel patterns, high-end travel market evolution, etc., from the perspective of social networks.
doc	Integrable scattering theories with unstable particles EOS We formulate a new bootstrap principle which allows for the construction of particle spectra involving unstable as well as stable particles. EOS We comment on the general Lie algebraic structure which underlies theories with unstable particles and propose several new scattering matrices. EOS We find a new Lie algebraic decoupling rule, which predicts the renormalization group flow in dependence of the relative ordering of the resonance parameters. EOS The proposals are exemplified for some concrete theories which involve unstable particles, such as the homogeneous sine-Gordon models and their generalizations.	The new decoupling rule can be validated by means of our new bootstrap principle and also via the renormalization group flow, which we obtain from a thermodynamic Bethe ansatz analysis.

doc	More results on the number of zeros of multiplicity at least r EOS We consider multivariate polynomials and investigate how many zeros of multiplicity at least _EQN_ they can have over a Cartesian product of finite subsets of a field. EOS Here r is any prescribed positive integer and the definition of multiplicity that we use is the one related to Hasse derivatives. EOS As a generalization of material in [2,5] a general version of the Schwartz-Zippel was presented in  which from the leading monomial -- with respect to a lexicographic ordering -- estimates the sum of zeros when counted with multiplicity. EOS The corresponding corollary on the number of zeros of multiplicity at least _EQN_ is in general not sharp and therefore in  a recursively defined function _EQN_ was introduced using which one can derive improved information.	The recursive function being rather complicated, the only known closed formula consequences of it are for the case of two variables.

doc	Burning Two Worlds: Algorithms for Burning Dense and Tree-like Graphs EOS Graph burning is a simple model for the spread of social influence in networks. EOS The objective is to measure how quickly a fire (e.g., a piece of fake news) can be spread in a network. EOS The burning process takes place in discrete rounds. EOS In each round, a new fire breaks out at a selected vertex and burns it. EOS Meanwhile, the old fires extend to their neighbours and burn them. EOS A burning schedule selects where the new fire breaks out in each round, and the burning problem asks for a schedule that burns all vertices in a minimum number of rounds, termed the burning number of the graph. EOS The burning problem is known to be NP-hard even when the graph is a tree or a disjoint set of paths. EOS For connected graphs, it has been conjectured that burning takes at most _EQN_ rounds. EOS We approach the algorithmic study of graph burning from two directions. EOS First, we consider graphs with minimum degree _EQN_. EOS We present an algorithm that burns any graph of size _EQN_ in at most _EQN_ rounds. EOS In particular, for dense graphs with _EQN_, all vertices are burned in a constant number of rounds. EOS More interestingly, even when _EQN_ is a constant that is independent of the graph size, our algorithm answers the graph-burning conjecture in the affirmative by burning the graph in at most _EQN_ rounds. EOS Next, we consider burning graphs with bounded path-length or tree-length. EOS These include many graph families including connected interval graphs and connected chordal graphs. EOS We show that any graph with path-length _EQN_ and diameter _EQN_ can be burned in _EQN_ rounds.	Our algorithm ensures an approximation ratio of _EQN_ for graphs of bounded path-length.

doc	Lopsidedness in WHISP galaxies: II. Morphological lopsidedness EOS The distribution of stars and gas in many galaxies is asymmetric. EOS This so-called lopsidedness is expected to significantly affect the dynamics and evolution of the disc, including the star formation activity. EOS Here, we measure the degree of lopsidedness for the gas distribution in a selected sample of 70 galaxies from the Westerbork HI Survey of Spiral and Irregular Galaxies. EOS This complements our earlier work (Paper I) where the kinematic lopsidedness was derived for the same galaxies. EOS The morphological lopsidedness is measured by performing a harmonic decomposition of the surface density maps. EOS The amplitude of lopsidedness A_1, the fractional value of the first Fourier component, is typically quite high (about 0.1) within the optical disc and has a constant phase. EOS Thus, lopsidedness is a common feature in galaxies and indicates a global mode. EOS We measure A_1 out to typically one to four optical radii, sometimes even further. EOS This is, on average, four times larger than the distance to which lopsidedness was measured in the past using near-IR as a tracer for the old stellar component, and will therefore provide a new, more stringent constraint on the mechanism for the origin of lopsidedness. EOS Interestingly, the value of A_1 saturates beyond the optical radius. EOS Furthermore, the plot of A_1 vs.	radius shows fluctuations which we argue are due to local spiral features.

EOS The cases of the point-to-point rate-distortion function, the rate-distortion function with side information at the decoder (i.e. EOS the Wyner-Ziv problem), and the multi-terminal source coding inner bound (i.e.	the Berger-Tung problem) are examined in this paper.

EOS The Web offers a wide range of data which can be represented by bipartite graphs, such us movies and reviewers in recomender systems, queries and URLs in search engines, users and posts in social networks. EOS The size and the dynamic nature of such graphs generate the need for more efficient ranking methods. EOS In this thesis, at first we present the fundamental mathematical backround that we use subsequently and we describe the basic principles of the Perron-Frobebius theory for non negative matrices as well as the the basic principles of the Markov chain theory.	Then, we propose a novel algorithm named BipartiteRank, which is suitable to rank scenarios, that can be represented as a bipartite graph.

The model goes through an initial contracting epoch that is followed by an expanding era.
doc	Primordial non-Gaussianity from the DBI Galileons EOS We study primordial fluctuations generated during inflation in a class of models motivated by the DBI Galileons, which are extensions of the DBI action that yield second order field equations. EOS This class of models generalises the DBI Galileons in a similar way with K-inflation. EOS We calculate the primordial non-Gaussianity from the bispectrum of the curvature perturbations at leading order in the slow-varying approximations. EOS We show that the estimator for the equilateral-type non-Gaussianity, _EQN_, can be applied to measure the amplitude of the primordial bispectrum even in the presence of the Galileon-like term although it gives a slightly different momentum dependence from K-inflation models. EOS For the DBI Galileons, we find _EQN_ and large primordial non-Gaussianities can be obtained when _EQN_ is much smaller than 1 as in the usual DBI inflation.	In G-inflation models, where a de Sitter solution is obtained without any potentials, the non-linear parameter is given by _EQN_ where _EQN_ is the tensor to scalar ratio, giving a stringent constraint on the model.

While SPT phases can now be realized in interacting synthethic quantum systems, the direct measurement of quantized many-body topological invariants has remained so far elusive.
doc	Stellar population synthesis based modelling of the Milky Way using asteroseismology of 13000 Kepler red giants EOS With current space-based missions it is now possible to obtain age-sensitive asteroseismic information for tens of thousands of red giants. EOS This provides a promising opportunity to study the Galactic structure and evolution. EOS We use asteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current theoretical framework of modelling the Galaxy based on population synthesis modeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. EOS We use the open source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of the masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the seismically-inferred observed masses. EOS The Galactic model overestimates the number of low mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low metallicity. EOS Using corrections to the _EQN_ scaling relation suggested by stellar models (available for download) significantly reduces the disagreement between predicted and observed masses.	For a few cases where non-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to _EQN_ also improve the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates.
doc	Connected sums of sphere products and minimally non-Golod complexes EOS We show that if the moment-angle complex _EQN_ associated to a simplicial complex _EQN_ is homotopy equivalent to a connected sum of sphere products with two spheres in each product, then _EQN_ decomposes as the simplicial join of an _EQN_ -simplex _EQN_ and a minimally non-Golod complex.	In particular, we prove that _EQN_ is minimally non-Golod for every moment-angle complex _EQN_ homeomorphic to a connected sum of two-fold products of spheres, answering a question of Grbi\'c, Panov, Theriault and Wu.

EOS In the present work, the accuracy of reduced-rank projections of _EQN_ is studied. EOS Non-asymptotic universal upper and lower bounds are derived, and favorable and unfavorable prototypes of matrices _EQN_ in terms of the accuracy of approximation are characterized. EOS The approach does not involve analytic perturbation theory of linear operators and allows for multiplicities in the singular value spectrum.	Our main result is some general non-asymptotic upper bound on the accuracy of approximation which involves explicitly the singular values of _EQN_, and which is shown to be sharp in various regimes of _EQN_.
doc	On The Equality Of The Grundy Numbers Of A Graph EOS Our work becomes integrated into the general problem of the stability of the network ad hoc. EOS Some, works attacked this problem. EOS Among these works, we find the modelling of the network ad hoc in the form of a graph. EOS Thus the problem of stability of the network ad hoc which corresponds to a problem of allocation of frequency amounts to a problem of allocation of colors in the vertex of graph. EOS we present use a parameter of coloring the number of Grundy. EOS The Grundy number of a graph G, denoted by (G), is the largest k such that G has a greedy k-coloring, that is a coloring with colours obtained by applying the greedy algorithm according to some ordering of the vertices of G.	In this paper, we study the Grundy number of the lexicographic, Cartesian and direct products of two graphs in terms of the Grundy numbers of these graphs.
doc	On the Limitations of the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm to Deception and Where Bivariate EDAs might help EOS We introduce a new benchmark problem called Deceptive Leading Blocks (DLB) to rigorously study the runtime of the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA) in the presence of epistasis and deception. EOS We show that simple Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) outperform the UMDA unless the selective pressure _EQN_ is extremely high, where _EQN_ and _EQN_ are the parent and offspring population sizes, respectively. EOS More precisely, we show that the UMDA with a parent population size of _EQN_ has an expected runtime of _EQN_ on the DLB problem assuming any selective pressure _EQN_, as opposed to the expected runtime of _EQN_ for the non-elitist _EQN_ with _EQN_. EOS These results illustrate inherent limitations of univariate EDAs against deception and epistasis, which are common characteristics of real-world problems. EOS In contrast, empirical evidence reveals the efficiency of the bi-variate MIMIC algorithm on the DLB problem.	Our results suggest that one should consider EDAs with more complex probabilistic models when optimising problems with some degree of epistasis and deception.

doc	Perspectives of Imaging of Single Protein Molecules with the Present Design of the European XFEL. - Part I - X-ray Source, Beamlime Optics and Instrument Simulations EOS The Single Particles, Clusters and Biomolecules (SPB) instrument at the European XFEL is located behind the SASE1 undulator, and aims to support imaging and structure determination of biological specimen between about 0.1 micrometer and 1 micrometer size. EOS The instrument is designed to work at photon energies from 3 keV up to 16 keV. EOS This wide operation range is a cause for challenges to the focusing optics.	In particular, a long propagation distance of about 900 m between x-ray source and sample leads to a large lateral photon beam size at the optics.

doc	Stable Camera Motion Estimation Using Convex Programming EOS We study the inverse problem of estimating n locations _EQN_ (up to global scale, translation and negation) in _EQN_ from noisy measurements of a subset of the (unsigned) pairwise lines that connect them, that is, from noisy measurements of _EQN_ for some pairs (i,j) (where the signs are unknown). EOS This problem is at the core of the structure from motion (SfM) problem in computer vision, where the _EQN_ 's represent camera locations in _EQN_. EOS The noiseless version of the problem, with exact line measurements, has been considered previously under the general title of parallel rigidity theory, mainly in order to characterize the conditions for unique realization of locations. EOS For noisy pairwise line measurements, current methods tend to produce spurious solutions that are clustered around a few locations. EOS This sensitivity of the location estimates is a well-known problem in SfM, especially for large, irregular collections of images. EOS In this paper we introduce a semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation, specially tailored to overcome the clustering phenomenon. EOS We further identify the implications of parallel rigidity theory for the location estimation problem to be well-posed, and prove exact (in the noiseless case) and stable location recovery results.	We also formulate an alternating direction method to solve the resulting semidefinite program, and provide a distributed version of our formulation for large numbers of locations.
doc	EROs found behind lensing clusters. II. Stellar populations and dust properties of optical dropout EROs and comparison with related objects EOS We determine the nature, redshift, stellar populations and dust properties of optically faint or non-detected extremely red objects (ERO) found from our survey of the lensing clusters A1835 and AC114. EOS We perform SED fitting and use deep optical, HST, VLT, Spitzer data, and for some objects and sub-mm data. EOS For most of the lensed EROs we find photometric redshifts showing a strong degeneracy between "low-z" (z~1-3) and high-z (z~6-7). EOS Although formally best fits are often found at high-z, their resulting bright absolute magnitudes, the number density of these objects, and in some cases Spitzer photometry or longer wavelength observations, suggest strongly that all of these objects are at "low-z". EOS The majority of these objects are best fitted with young (<~ 0.5-0.7 Gyr) and dusty starbursts. EOS Indications for strong extinction, with A_V~2.4-4, are found in some objects. EOS For dusty objects star formation rates (SFR) have been estimated from the bolometric luminosity determined after fitting of semi-empirical starburst, ERO, and ULIRG templates. EOS Typically we find SFR~(1-18) Msun/yr. EOS Again, SMMJ14009+0252 stands out as a LIRG with SFR 1000 Msun/yr.	Concerning the comparison objects, we argue that the massive post-starburst z~6.5 galaxy candidate HUDF-J2 showing observed properties very similar to our EROs, is more likely a dusty starburst at z~2.3-2.6.

doc	The Disruptive Potential of FinTechs in the German Consumer Finance Sector -- A Blue Ocean Scenario? EOS Using the Blue Ocean strategy as an underlying strategic element, this dissertation analyses whether this statement holds true for the rather more conservative banking sector in Germany and the overall risk-averse mindset of the German population by using both quantitative and qualitative elements to assess the current market share of FinTech companies in the Federal Republic, as well as grasp a potential outlook on the future development. EOS A literature review of the strategic framework, the banking sector in Germany and the FinTech sector is carried out accordingly.	Subsequently, a formal verification as to whether the banking sector is a "Red Ocean" and if the FinTech industry is a "Blue Ocean" is carried out using case studies from both sectors.
doc	Artificial Staggered Magnetic Field for Ultracold Atoms in Optical Lattices EOS A time-dependent optical lattice with staggered particle current in the tight-binding regime was considered that can be described by a time-independent effective lattice model with an artificial staggered magnetic field. EOS The low energy description of a single-component fermion in this lattice at half-filling is provided by two copies of ideal two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. EOS The Dirac cones are generally anisotropic and can be tuned by the external staggered flux _EQN_. EOS For bosons, the staggered flux modifies the single-particle spectrum such that in the weak coupling limit, depending on the flux _EQN_, distinct superfluid phases are realized. EOS Their properties are discussed, the nature of the phase transitions between them is establised, and Bogoliubov theory is used to determine their excitation spectra. EOS Then the generalized superfluid-Mott-insulator transition is studied in the presence of the staggered flux and the complete phase diagram is established.	Finally, the momentum distribution of the distinct superfluid phases is obtained, which provides a clear experimental signature of each phase in ballistic expansion experiments.

EOS This function is analogous to transfer learning (TL) in the field of machine learning. EOS TL uses a well-trained feature space in a specific task domain to improve performance in new tasks with insufficient training data.	TL with rich feature representations, such as features of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), shows high generalization ability across different task domains.
doc	Way Off-Policy Batch Deep Reinforcement Learning of Implicit Human Preferences in Dialog EOS Most deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems are not able to learn effectively from off-policy data, especially if they cannot explore online in the environment. EOS These are critical shortcomings for applying RL to real-world problems where collecting data is expensive, and models must be tested offline before being deployed to interact with the environment -- e.g. EOS systems that learn from human interaction. EOS Thus, we develop a novel class of off-policy batch RL algorithms, which are able to effectively learn offline, without exploring, from a fixed batch of human interaction data. EOS We leverage models pre-trained on data as a strong prior, and use KL-control to penalize divergence from this prior during RL training. EOS We also use dropout-based uncertainty estimates to lower bound the target Q-values as a more efficient alternative to Double Q-Learning.	The algorithms are tested on the problem of open-domain dialog generation -- a challenging reinforcement learning problem with a 20,000-dimensional action space.

doc	The radiative decays of the singly heavy baryons in chiral perturbation theory EOS In the framework of the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT), we calculate the radiative decay amplitudes of the singly heavy baryons up to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO).	In the numerical analysis, we adopt the heavy quark symmetry to relate some low energy constants (LECs) with those LECs in the calculation of the magnetic moments.
doc	Model analysis on thermal UV-cutoff effects on the critical boundary in hot QCD EOS We study the critical boundary on the quark-mass plane associated with the chiral phase transition in QCD at finite temperature. EOS We point out that the critical boundaries obtained from the Lattice QCD simulation and the chiral effective model are significantly different; EOS in the (Polyakov-loop coupled) Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model we find that the critical mass is about one order of magnitude smaller than the value reported in the Lattice QCD case. EOS It is known in the Lattice QCD study that the critical mass goes smaller in the continuum limit along the temporal direction.	To investigate the temporal UV-cutoff effects quantitatively we consider the (P)NJL model with only finite _EQN_ Matsubara frequencies taken in the summation.
doc	Realization of algebras with the help of star-products EOS We present a closed formula for a family of star-products by replacing the partial derivatives in the Moyal-Weyl formula with commuting vector fields.

doc	On Adaptive Estimation for Dynamic Bernoulli Bandits EOS The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a classic example of the exploration-exploitation dilemma. EOS It is concerned with maximising the total rewards for a gambler by sequentially pulling an arm from a multi-armed slot machine where each arm is associated with a reward distribution. EOS In static MABs, the reward distributions do not change over time, while in dynamic MABs, each arm's reward distribution can change, and the optimal arm can switch over time.	Motivated by many real applications where rewards are binary, we focus on dynamic Bernoulli bandits.
doc	Superconducting Properties of Two-Orbital t-t'-J-J' Models EOS Motivated by the recent contradiction of the superconducting pairing symmetry in the angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data in the FeAs superconductors, we present the theoretical results on the phase diagram, the temperature dependent Fermi surfaces in normal state, the ARPES character of quasiparticles and the spin-lattice relaxation 1/T _EQN_ of the two-orbital t-t _EQN_ -J-J _EQN_ models.	Our results show that most of the properties observed in iron-based superconductors could be comprehensively understood in the present scenario qualitatively, indicating that the pairing symmetry of the ironpnictides is anisotropic nodeless s-wave, mainly originating from the band structures and the Fermi surface topology.

doc	Heavy absorption and soft X-ray emission lines in the XMM-Newton spectrum of the Type 2 radio-loud quasar 3C 234 EOS We report results on a 40 ks XMM-Newton observation of the Type 2 quasar 3C 234. EOS Optical spectropolarimetric data have demonstrated the presence of a hidden broad-line region in this powerful (M_V <~ -24.2 after reddening and starlight correction) narrow-line FRII radio galaxy. EOS Our analysis is aimed at investigating the X-ray spectral properties of this peculiar source which have remained poorly known so far. EOS We analyze the 0.5--10 keV spectroscopic data collected by the EPIC cameras in 2006. EOS The X-ray spectrum of this radio-loud quasar is typical of a local Compton-thin Seyfert 2 galaxy. EOS It exhibits strong absorption (Nh~3.5 x 10^ 23 cm^ -2) and a narrow, neutral Fe Kalpha emission line with an equivalent width of ~140+/-40 eV. EOS Our observation also reveals that the soft portion of the spectrum is characterized by strong emission lines with a very low level of scattered primary continuum. EOS A possible explanation of these features in terms of thermal emission from a two-temperature collisionally ionized plasma emission seems to be unlikely due to the high luminosity estimated for this component (L(0.5-2) ~ 6 x 10^ 42 erg/s). EOS It is likely that most of the soft X-ray emission originates from a photoionized plasma as commonly observed in obscured, radio-quiet Seyfert-like AGNs.	This X-ray observation has definitively confirmed the presence of a hidden quasar in 3C 234.

doc	An adaptive and fully automatic method for estimating the 3D position of bendable instruments using endoscopic images EOS Background. EOS Flexible bendable instruments are key tools for performing surgical endoscopy. EOS Being able to measure the 3D position of such instruments can be useful for various tasks, such as controlling automatically robotized instruments and analyzing motions. EOS Methods. EOS We propose an automatic method to infer the 3D pose of a single bending section instrument, using only the images provided by a monocular camera embedded at the tip of the endoscope. EOS The proposed method relies on colored markers attached onto the bending section. EOS The image of the instrument is segmented using a graph-based method and the corners of the markers are extracted by detecting the color transition along B \'e zier curves fitted on edge points. EOS These features are accurately located and then used to estimate the 3D pose of the instrument using an adaptive model that allows to take into account the mechanical play between the instrument and its housing channel. EOS Results. EOS The feature extraction method provides good localization of markers corners with images of in vivo environment despite sensor saturation due to strong lighting.	The RMS error on the estimation of the tip position of the instrument for laboratory experiments was 2.1, 1.96, 3.18 mm in the x, y and z directions respectively.

doc	Surface Photometric Calibration of the Infrared Tully-Fisher Relation Using Cepheid-based Distances of Galaxies EOS Infrared J and H surface photometry are carried out for nearby 12 galaxies whose distances have been accurately measured via HST Cepheid observations. EOS Using the total, isophotal, and surface-photometric aperture magnitudes we calibrate the infrared luminosity-line width relation (IRTF). EOS It is found that IRTF changes its slope at log W_ 20 ^c=2.45 in all the examined magnitude systems. EOS The apparent scatter of IRTF is not significantly reduced when surface photometric magnitudes are used instead of the conventionally used synthetic aperture magnitude H_ -0.5. EOS It is also shown that the color (I-H)_T of the nearby calibrator galaxies is redder by 0.2mag than the Coma cluster galaxies, but such a trend is not clearly visible for the Ursa Major mostly because of poor statistics. EOS The color offset of the Coma is analogous to that previously found in I_T-H_ -0.5.	From the present calibration of H-band IRTF, we obtain the distance to the Coma cluster to be m-M=34.94 +/- 0.13mag, where no account is taken of the I-H color problem.
doc	Little String Defects and Bala-Carter Theory EOS We give a physical realization of the Bala-Carter labels that classify nilpotent orbits of semi-simple Lie algebras, for the case _EQN_. EOS We start from type IIB string theory compactified on an _EQN_ singularity and study the six-dimensional (2,0) _EQN_ -type little string on a Riemann surface with punctures. EOS The defects are introduced as D-branes wrapping the 2-cycles of the singularity. EOS At low energies, the little string becomes the (2,0) conformal field theory of type _EQN_. EOS As an application, we derive the full list of _EQN_ little string defects, and their Bala-Carter label in the CFT limit.	Furthermore, we investigate new relations between the quiver gauge theory describing the D-brane defects at low energies, and the weighted Dynkin diagrams of _EQN_.

doc	Discovery of Eclipses from the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar SWIFT J1749.4-2807 EOS We report the discovery of X-ray eclipses in the recently discovered accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Swift J1749.4-2807. EOS This is the first detection of X-ray eclipses in a system of this type and should enable a precise neutron star mass measurement once the companion star is identified and studied. EOS We present a combined pulse and eclipse timing solution that enables tight constraints on the orbital parameters and inclination and shows that the companion mass is in the range 0.6-0.8 M_sun for a likely range of neutron star masses, and that it is larger than a main sequence star of the same mass. EOS We observed two individual eclipse egresses and a single ingress. EOS Our timing model shows that the eclipse features are symmetric about the time of 90 deg longitude from the ascending node, as expected. EOS Our eclipse timing solution gives an eclipse duration (from the mid-points of ingress to egress) of 2172 +/- 13 s. EOS This represents 6.85% of the 8.82 hr orbital period.	This system also presents a potential measurement of "Shapiro" delay due to General Relativity;

doc	Charm Production in Hadronic and Heavy-Ion Collisions at RHIC and LHC Energies to _EQN_ EOS We present results on rapidity and transverse momentum distributions of inclusive charm quark production in hadronic and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, including the next-to-leading order, _EQN_, radiative corrections and the nuclear shadowing effect. EOS We determine the hadronic and the effective (in-medium) K-factor for the differential and total inclusive charm cross sections. EOS We find the fraction of central and inelastic events that contain at least one charm quark pair at LHC energies and obtain the effective _EQN_ -dependence of the inclusive charm production in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC.	We discuss theoretical uncertainties inherent in our calculation.

doc	Manifold Adversarial Learning EOS Recently proposed adversarial training methods show the robustness to both adversarial and original examples and achieve state-of-the-art results in supervised and semi-supervised learning. EOS All the existing adversarial training methods consider only how the worst perturbed examples (i.e., adversarial examples) could affect the model output. EOS Despite their success, we argue that such setting may be in lack of generalization, since the output space (or label space) is apparently less informative.In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Manifold Adversarial Training (MAT). EOS MAT manages to build an adversarial framework based on how the worst perturbation could affect the distributional manifold rather than the output space. EOS Particularly, a latent data space with the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) will be first derived.On one hand, MAT tries to perturb the input samples in the way that would rough the distributional manifold the worst. EOS On the other hand, the deep learning model is trained trying to promote in the latent space the manifold smoothness, measured by the variation of Gaussian mixtures (given the local perturbation around the data point).	Importantly, since the latent space is more informative than the output space, the proposed MAT can learn better a robust and compact data representation, leading to further performance improvement.
doc	Hamilton-Jacobi Theory for Degenerate Lagrangian Systems with Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints EOS We extend Hamilton-Jacobi theory to Lagrange-Dirac (or implicit Lagrangian) systems, a generalized formulation of Lagrangian mechanics that can incorporate degenerate Lagrangians as well as holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. EOS We refer to the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation as the Dirac-Hamilton-Jacobi equation. EOS For non-degenerate Lagrangian systems with nonholonomic constraints, the theory specializes to the recently developed nonholonomic Hamilton-Jacobi theory.	We are particularly interested in applications to a certain class of degenerate nonholonomic Lagrangian systems with symmetries, which we refer to as weakly degenerate Chaplygin systems, that arise as simplified models of nonholonomic mechanical systems;
doc	Syntax-Enhanced Neural Machine Translation with Syntax-Aware Word Representations EOS Syntax has been demonstrated highly effective in neural machine translation (NMT). EOS Previous NMT models integrate syntax by representing 1-best tree outputs from a well-trained parsing system, e.g., the representative Tree-RNN and Tree-Linearization methods, which may suffer from error propagation. EOS In this work, we propose a novel method to integrate source-side syntax implicitly for NMT. EOS The basic idea is to use the intermediate hidden representations of a well-trained end-to-end dependency parser, which are referred to as syntax-aware word representations (SAWRs). EOS Then, we simply concatenate such SAWRs with ordinary word embeddings to enhance basic NMT models. EOS The method can be straightforwardly integrated into the widely-used sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) NMT models. EOS We start with a representative RNN-based Seq2Seq baseline system, and test the effectiveness of our proposed method on two benchmark datasets of the Chinese-English and English-Vietnamese translation tasks, respectively. EOS Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to bring significant BLEU score improvements on the two datasets compared with the baseline, 1.74 points for Chinese-English translation and 0.80 point for English-Vietnamese translation, respectively.	In addition, the approach also outperforms the explicit Tree-RNN and Tree-Linearization methods.

doc	Shaping Planetary Nebulae: is it different for [WR] stars? EOS This review discusses the physics of the formation of planetary nebulae around low mass WR stars, or [WR] stars. EOS It especially focuses on the differences which can be expected due to the different character of the fast winds from these [WR] stars. EOS Their fast winds are more massive and are highly H deficient and metal enriched compared to the winds of normal central stars of planetary nebulae.	This is expected to lead to faster expansion velocities for the nebulae and a longer momentum-driven phase in the evolution of the wind-driven bubble, leading to more turbulent nebulae.
doc	HST-COS Observations of Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon and Nitrogen Emission from the SN 1987A Reverse Shock EOS We present the most sensitive ultraviolet observations of Supernova 1987A to date. EOS Imaging spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph shows many narrow (dv \sim 300 km/s) emission lines from the circumstellar ring, broad (dv \sim 10 -- 20 x 10^3 km/s) emission lines from the reverse shock, and ultraviolet continuum emission. EOS The high signal-to-noise (> 40 per resolution element) broad LyA emission is excited by soft X-ray and EUV heating of mostly neutral gas in the circumstellar ring and outer supernova debris.	The ultraviolet continuum at \lambda > 1350A can be explained by HI 2-photon emission from the same region.
doc	Proof that the real part of all non-trivial zeros of Riemann zeta function is 1/2 EOS This article proves the Riemann hypothesis, which states that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function have a real part equal to 1/2. EOS We inspect in detail the integral form of the (symmetrized) completed zeta function, which is a product between the zeta and gamma functions. EOS It is known that two integral lines, expressing the completed zeta function, rotated from the real axis in the opposite directions, can be shifted without affecting the completed zeta function owing to the residue theorem. EOS The completed zeta function is regular in the region of the complex plane under consideration. EOS For convenience in the subsequent singularity analysis of the above integral, we first deform and shift the integral contours. EOS We then investigate the singularities of the composite elements (caused by polynomial integrals in opposite directions), which appear only in the case for which the distance between the contours and the origin of the coordinates approaches zero.	The real part of the zeros of the zeta function is determined to be 1/2 along a symmetry line from the singularity removal condition.

doc	Nonlinear Evolution of Very Small Scale Cosmological Baryon Perturbations at Recombination EOS The evolution of baryon density perturbations on very small scales is investigated. EOS In particular, the nonlinear growth induced by the radiation drag force from the shear velocity field on larger scales during the recombination epoch, which is originally proposed by Shaviv in 1998, is studied in detail. EOS It is found that inclusion of the diffusion term which Shaviv neglected in his analysis results in rather mild growth whose growth rate is _EQN_ instead of enormous amplification _EQN_ of Shaviv's original claim since the diffusion suppresses the growth. EOS The growth factor strongly depends on the amplitude of the large scale velocity field. EOS The nonlinear growth mechanism is applied to density perturbations of general adiabatic cold dark matter (CDM) models. EOS In these models, it has been found in the previous works that the baryon density perturbations are not completely erased by diffusion damping if there exists gravitational potential of CDM. EOS With employing the perturbed rate equation which is derived in this paper, the nonlinear evolution of baryon density perturbations is investigated. EOS It is found that: (1) The nonlinear growth is larger for smaller scales. EOS This mechanism only affects the perturbations whose scales are smaller than _EQN_, which are coincident with the stellar scales.	(2) The maximum growth factors of baryon density fluctuations for various COBE normalized CDM models are typically less than factor 10 for _EQN_ large scale velocity peaks.

The loss of rotational energy, which powers radio pulsars, is insufficient to power AXPs.
doc	Modeling of Individual HRTFs based on Spatial Principal Component Analysis EOS Head-related transfer function (HRTF) plays an important role in the construction of 3D auditory display. EOS This paper presents an individual HRTF modeling method using deep neural networks based on spatial principal component analysis. EOS The HRTFs are represented by a small set of spatial principal components combined with frequency and individual-dependent weights. EOS By estimating the spatial principal components using deep neural networks and mapping the corresponding weights to a quantity of anthropometric parameters, we predict individual HRTFs in arbitrary spatial directions. EOS The objective and subjective experiments evaluate the HRTFs generated by the proposed method, the principal component analysis (PCA) method, and the generic method. EOS The results show that the HRTFs generated by the proposed method and PCA method perform better than the generic method. EOS For most frequencies the spectral distortion of the proposed method is significantly smaller than the PCA method in the high frequencies but significantly larger in the low frequencies.	The evaluation of the localization model shows the PCA method is better than the proposed method.

EOS This paper examines the maturity of security measures for NoSQL databases, addressing their new query and access mechanisms. EOS For example the emergence of new query formats makes the old SQL injection techniques irrelevant, but are NoSQL databases immune to injection in general? EOS The answer is NO. EOS Here we present a few techniques for attacking NoSQL databases such as injections and CSRF.	We analyze the source of these vulnerabilities and present methodologies to mitigate the attacks.

EOS Accurate evaluations of expectations or higher moments for the quantities of interest require a prohibitively large number of model evaluations. EOS In this paper we propose an alternative approach based on using surrogate models valid over the range of the forecast uncertainty.	We consider surrogate models based on Polynomial Chaos expansions, constructed using sparse quadrature methods.

EOS The objectives of this work were to improve on the available authentication methods and apply it on examination result checking system. EOS The work takes care of only course codes with their grades, the current GPA and the overall CGPA. EOS It employs the Pull SMS service, built on an independent service and a modem. EOS Examination results consist of sensitive information, hence the need to further enhance the ones already in place so as to ensure further privacy and integrity, In the course of this project, the following assumptions were made: That a system that does the computation of students' result, calculate of GPA and CGPA is already in place. EOS The implemented system was connected to the database of the existing system. EOS A database that contains the bio-data of each student admitted exists.	That SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) modem exists and should have been used but to reduce cost, a modem that can act like a SIM browser is used with a standard SIM card inserted in it and connected via cable to the application server.
doc	K2 rotation periods for low-mass Hyads and a quantitative comparison of the distribution of slow rotators in the Hyades and Praesepe EOS We analyze K2 light curves for 132 low-mass (_EQN_ ~ _EQN_) members of the 600--800~Myr-old Hyades cluster and measure rotation periods (_EQN_) for 116 of these stars. EOS These include 93 stars with no prior _EQN_ measurement; EOS the total number of Hyads with known _EQN_ is now 232. EOS We then combine literature binary data with Gaia DR2 photometry and astrometry to select single star sequences in the Hyades and its roughly coeval Praesepe open cluster, and derive a new reddening value of _EQN_ \pm _EQN_ for Praesepe. EOS Comparing the effective temperature-- _EQN_ distributions for the Hyades and Praesepe, we find that solar-type Hyads rotate, on average, 0.4~d slower than their Praesepe counterparts. EOS This _EQN_ difference indicates that the Hyades is slightly older than Praesepe: we apply a new gyrochronology model tuned with Praesepe and the Sun, and find an age difference between the two clusters of 57~Myr. EOS However, this _EQN_ difference decreases and eventually disappears for lower-mass stars.	This provides further evidence for stalling in the rotational evolution of these stars, and highlights the need for more detailed analysis of angular-momentum evolution for stars of different masses and ages.
doc	SimAS: A Simulation-assisted Approach for the Scheduling Algorithm Selection under Perturbations EOS Many scientific applications consist of large and computationally-intensive loops. EOS Dynamic loop self-scheduling (DLS) techniques are used to parallelize and to balance the load during the execution of such applications. EOS Load imbalance arises from variations in the loop iteration (or tasks) execution times, caused by problem, algorithmic, or systemic characteristics. EOS The variations in systemic characteristics are referred to as perturbations, and can be caused by other applications or processes that share the same resources, or a temporary system fault or malfunction. EOS Therefore, the selection of the most efficient DLS technique is critical to achieve the best application performance.	The following question motivates this work: Given an application, an HPC system, and their characteristics and interplay, which DLS technique will achieve improved performance under unpredictable perturbations?
doc	Present and Future Bounds on Non-Standard Neutrino Interactions EOS We consider Non-Standard neutrino Interactions (NSI), described by four-fermion operators of the form _EQN_, where _EQN_ is an electron or first generation quark. EOS We assume these operators are generated at dimension _EQN_, so the related vertices involving charged leptons, obtained by an SU(2) transformation _EQN_, do not appear at tree level. EOS These related vertices necessarily arise at one loop, via _EQN_ exchange. EOS We catalogue current constraints from _EQN_ measurements in neutrino scattering, from atmospheric neutrino observations, from LEP, and from bounds on the related charged lepton operators. EOS We estimate future bounds from comparing KamLAND and solar neutrino data, and from measuring _EQN_ at the near detector of a neutrino factory.	Operators constructed with _EQN_ and _EQN_ should not confuse the determination of oscillation parameters at a _EQN_ factory, because the processes we consider are more sensitive than oscillations at the far detector.
doc	Introduction to the Quantum Theory of Elementary Cycles: The Emergence of Space, Time and Quantum EOS Elementary Cycles Theory is a self-consistent, unified formulation of quantum and relativistic physics. EOS Here we introduce its basic quantum aspects. EOS On one hand, Newton's law of inertia states that every isolated particle has persistent motion, i.e.	constant energy and momentum.

doc	Hadron Helicity Violation in Exclusive Processes: Quantitative Calculations in Leading Order QCD EOS We study a new mechanism for hadronic helicity flip in high energy hard exclusive reactions. EOS The mechanism proceeds in the limit of perfect chiral symmetry, namely without any need to flip a quark helicity. EOS The fundamental feature of the new mechanism is the breaking of rotational symmetry of the hard collision by a scattering plane in processes involving independent quark scattering. EOS We show that in the impulse approximation there is no evidence for of the helicity violating process as the energy or momentum transfer _EQN_ is increased over the region 1 GeV^2 < Q^2 < 100 GeV^2.	In the asymptotic region Q^2> 1000 GeV^2, a saddle point approximation with doubly logarithmic accuracy yields suppression by a fraction of power of Q^2.
doc	The NGC4839 group falling into the Coma cluster observed by XMM-Newton EOS We present here the first analysis of the XMM Newton EPIC-MOS data of the galaxy group around NGC4839, which lies at a projected distance to the Coma cluster center of 1.6Mpc. EOS In our analysis, which includes imaging, spectro-imaging and spectroscopy we find compelling evidence for the sub group being on its first infall onto the Coma cluster. EOS The complex temperature structure around NGC 4839 is consistent with simulations of galaxies falling into a cluster environment. EOS We see indications of a bow shock and of ram pressure stripping around NGC4839. EOS Furthermore our data reveal a displacement between NGC4839 and the center of the hot gas in the group of about 300kpc.	With a simple approximation we can explain this displacement by the pressure force originating from the infall, which acts much stronger on the group gas than on the galaxies.
doc	Complex ferromagnetic state and magnetocaloric effect in single crystalline Nd_ 0.7 Sr_ 0.3 MnO_ 3 EOS The magnetocaloric effect in single crystalline Nd_ 0.7 Sr_ 0.3 MnO_ 3 is investigated by measuring the field-induced adiabatic change in temperature which reveals a single negative peak around 130 K well below the Curie temperature (T_C=203 K).	In order to understand this unusual magnetocaloric effect, we invoke the reported 55 ^Mn spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance, electron magnetic resonance and polarized Raman scattering measurements on Nd_ 0.7 Sr_ 0.3 MnO_ 3.

doc	A Bumpy Start to a Smooth Ride: Onset of Inflation amid Backreaction from Inhomogeneities EOS We analyze the onset of inflation for a simple single-field model when the system begins with significant inhomogeneities on length-scales shorter than the initial Hubble radius. EOS We incorporate certain nonlinear interactions among the coupled degrees of freedom by using the nonperturbative Hartree approximation. EOS Consistent with recent, more computationally intensive numerical-relativity studies, we find inflation to be robust for large-field models, even when the system begins with significant structure on sub-Hubble scales. EOS We consider the space of initial conditions _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the vacuum expectation value of the quantized field that drives inflation. EOS Although some regions of _EQN_ that would have yielded sufficient inflation in the absence of inhomogeneities fail to do so when backreaction from inhomogeneities is incorporated, an equal volume of such regions succeeds in producing sufficient inflation which did not do so in the absence of inhomogeneities.	For large-field models, in other words, the total volume of the space of initial conditions _EQN_ that yields sufficient inflation is conserved when we incorporate nonlinear backreaction from inhomogeneities, compared to the case in which inhomogeneities are neglected.
doc	Multiple low-turbulence starless cores associated with intermediate- to high-mass star formation EOS To characterize the initial conditions for intermediate- to high-mass star formation, we observed two Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) that remain absorption features up to 70mum wavelength, with the PdBI in the 3.23mm dust continuum as well as the N2H+(1--0) and 13CS(2-1) line emission. EOS While IRDC19175-4 is clearly detected in the 3.23mm continuum, the second source in the field, IRDC19175-5, is only barely observable above the 3sigma continuum detection threshold. EOS However, the N2H+(1-0) observations reveal 17 separate sub-sources in the vicinity of the two IRDCs. EOS Most of them exhibit low levels of turbulence (dv \leq 1km/s), indicating that the fragmentation process in these cores may be dominated by the interplay of thermal pressure and gravity, but not so much by turbulence. EOS Combining the small line widths with the non-detection up to 70mum and the absence of other signs of star formation activity, most of these 17 cores with masses between sub-solar to ~10M_sun are likely still in a starless phase.	Furthermore, we find a large CS depletion factor of the order 100.
doc	A Calculus for Sensor Networks EOS We consider the problem of providing a rigorous model for programming wireless sensor networks. EOS Assuming that collisions, packet losses, and errors are dealt with at the lower layers of the protocol stack, we propose a Calculus for Sensor Networks (CSN) that captures the main abstractions for programming applications for this class of devices.	Besides providing the syntax and semantics for the calculus, we show its expressiveness by providing implementations for several examples of typical operations on sensor networks.
doc	Effects of Disorder on the Transport of Collective Modes in an Excitonic Condensate EOS An excitonic insulator (EI) is an unconventional quantum phase of matter in which excitons, bound pairs of electrons and holes, undergo Bose--Einstein condensation, forming a macroscopic coherent state.

doc	Network Massive MIMO for Cell-Boundary Users: From a Precoding Normalization Perspective EOS In this paper, we propose network massive multiple- input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where three radio units (RUs) connected via one digital unit (DU) support multiple user equipments (UEs) at a cell-boundary through the same radio resource, i.e., the same frequency/time band. EOS For precoding designs, zero-forcing (ZF) and matched filter (MF) with vector or matrix normalization are considered. EOS We also derive the formulae of the lower and upper bounds of the achievable sum rate for each precoding.	Based on our analytical results, we observe that vector normalization is better for ZF while matrix normalization is better for MF.
doc	Interplay between finite topological rank minimal Cantor systems, _EQN_ -adic subshifts and their complexity EOS Minimal Cantor systems of finite topological rank (that can be represented by a Bratteli-Vershik diagram with a uniformly bounded number of vertices per level) are known to have dynamical rigidity properties. EOS We establish that such systems, when they are expansive, define the same class of systems, up to topological conjugacy, as primitive and recognizable _EQN_ -adic subshifts. EOS This is done establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for a minimal subshift to be of finite topological rank. EOS As an application, we show that minimal subshifts with non-superlinear complexity (like all classical zero entropy examples) have finite topological rank. EOS Conversely, we analyze the complexity of _EQN_ -adic subshifts and provide sufficient conditions for a finite topological rank subshift to have a non-superlinear complexity. EOS This includes minimal Cantor systems given by Bratteli-Vershik representations whose tower levels have proportional heights and the so called left to right _EQN_ -adic subshifts. EOS We also exhibit that finite topological rank does not imply non-superlinear complexity.	In the particular case of topological rank 2 subshifts, we prove their complexity is always subquadratic along a subsequence and their automorphism group is trivial.
doc	Simple, Fast, Accurate Intent Classification and Slot Labeling for Goal-Oriented Dialogue Systems EOS With the advent of conversational assistants, like Amazon Alexa, Google Now, etc., dialogue systems are gaining a lot of traction, especially in industrial setting. EOS These systems typically consist of Spoken Language understanding component which, in turn, consists of two tasks - Intent Classification (IC) and Slot Labeling (SL). EOS Generally, these two tasks are modeled together jointly to achieve best performance. EOS However, this joint modeling adds to model obfuscation. EOS In this work, we first design framework for a modularization of joint IC-SL task to enhance architecture transparency. EOS Then, we explore a number of self-attention, convolutional, and recurrent models, contributing a large-scale analysis of modeling paradigms for IC+SL across two datasets.	Finally, using this framework, we propose a class of 'label-recurrent' models that otherwise non-recurrent, with a 10-dimensional representation of the label history, and show that our proposed systems are easy to interpret, highly accurate (achieving over 30% error reduction in SL over the state-of-the-art on the Snips dataset), as well as fast, at 2x the inference and 2/3 to 1/2 the training time of comparable recurrent models, thus giving an edge in critical real-world systems.

The result indicates that it is crucial to take into account the direct contribution to the moments of inertia from the aligned quasiparticle(s) so as to realize \mathcal J _x > \mathcal J _y in positive-\gamma shapes.
doc	Complex Cepstrum-based Decomposition of Speech for Glottal Source Estimation EOS Homomorphic analysis is a well-known method for the separation of non-linearly combined signals. EOS More particularly, the use of complex cepstrum for source-tract deconvolution has been discussed in various articles. EOS However there exists no study which proposes a glottal flow estimation methodology based on cepstrum and reports effective results. EOS In this paper, we show that complex cepstrum can be effectively used for glottal flow estimation by separating the causal and anticausal components of a windowed speech signal as done by the Zeros of the Z-Transform (ZZT) decomposition. EOS Based on exactly the same principles presented for ZZT decomposition, windowing should be applied such that the windowed speech signals exhibit mixed-phase characteristics which conform the speech production model that the anticausal component is mainly due to the glottal flow open phase.	The advantage of the complex cepstrum-based approach compared to the ZZT decomposition is its much higher speed.
doc	High Rate Single-Symbol Decodable Precoded DSTBCs for Cooperative Networks EOS Distributed Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (DOSTBCs) achieving full diversity order and single-symbol ML decodability have been introduced recently for cooperative networks and an upper-bound on the maximal rate of such codes along with code constructions has been presented. EOS In this report, we introduce a new class of Distributed STBCs called Semi-orthogonal Precoded Distributed Single-Symbol Decodable STBCs (S-PDSSDC) wherein, the source performs co-ordinate interleaving of information symbols appropriately before transmitting it to all the relays. EOS It is shown that DOSTBCs are a special case of S-PDSSDCs. EOS A special class of S-PDSSDCs having diagonal covariance matrix at the destination is studied and an upper bound on the maximal rate of such codes is derived. EOS The bounds obtained are approximately twice larger than that of the DOSTBCs.	A systematic construction of S-PDSSDCs is presented when the number of relays _EQN_.

doc	Dynamics of correlations in two-dimensional quantum spin models with long-range interactions: A phase-space Monte-Carlo study EOS Interacting quantum spin models are remarkably useful for describing different types of physical, chemical, and biological systems. EOS Significant understanding of their equilibrium properties has been achieved to date, especially for the case of spin models with short-range couplings. EOS However, progress towards the development of a comparable understanding in long-range interacting models, in particular out-of-equilibrium, remains limited. EOS In a recent work, we proposed a semiclassical numerical method to study spin models, the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA), and demonstrated its capability to correctly capture the dynamics of one- and two-point correlations in one dimensional (1D) systems. EOS Here we go one step forward and use the DTWA method to study the dynamics of correlations in 2D systems with many spins and different types of long-range couplings, in regimes where other numerical methods are generally unreliable. EOS We compute spatial and time-dependent correlations for spin-couplings that decay with distance as a power-law and determine the velocity at which correlations propagate through the system.	Sharp changes in the behavior of those velocities are found as a function of the power-law decay exponent.
doc	Langevin + Hydrodynamics Approach to Heavy Quark Propagation and Correlation in QGP EOS We develop a relativistic Langevin dynamics under the background of strongly interacting quark-gluon fluid described by the (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics. EOS The drag force acting on charm and bottom quarks is parametrized according to the formula obtained from the anti-de-Sitter space/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. EOS In this setup, we calculate the nuclear modification factor _EQN_ for the single-electrons from the charm and bottom quarks to extract the magnitude of the drag force from the PHENIX and STAR data. EOS The _EQN_ for single-electrons with _EQN_ GeV indicates that the drag force is close to the AdS/CFT prediction.	Effects of the drag force on the elliptic flow of single-electrons are also discussed.
doc	Multiscale approaches to protein-mediated interactions between membranes - Relating microscopic and macroscopic dynamics in radially growing adhesions EOS Macromolecular complexation leading to coupling of two or more cellular membranes is a crucial step in a number of biological functions of the cell. EOS While other mechanisms may also play a role, adhesion always involves the fluctuations of deformable membranes, the diffusion of proteins and the molecular binding and unbinding. EOS Because these stochastic processes couple over a multitude of time and length scales, theoretical modeling of membrane adhesion has been a major challenge. EOS Here we present an effective Monte Carlo scheme within which the effects of the membrane are integrated into local rates for molecular recognition. EOS The latter step in the Monte Carlo approach enables us to simulate the nucleation and growth of adhesion domains within a system of the size of a cell for tens of seconds without loss of accuracy, as shown by comparison to _EQN_ times more expensive Langevin simulations. EOS To perform this validation, the Langevin approach was augmented to simulate diffusion of proteins explicitly, together with reaction kinetics and membrane dynamics.	We use the Monte Carlo scheme to gain deeper insight to the experimentally observed radial growth of micron sized adhesion domains, and connect the effective rate with which the domain is growing to the underlying microscopic events.

doc	Some Riemann Hypotheses from Random Walks over Primes EOS The aim of this article is to investigate how various Riemann Hypotheses would follow only from properties of the prime numbers. EOS To this end, we consider two classes of _EQN_ -functions, namely, non-principal Dirichlet and those based on cusp forms. EOS The simplest example of the latter is based on the Ramanujan tau arithmetic function. EOS For both classes we prove that if a particular trigonometric series involving sums of multiplicative characters over primes is _EQN_, then the Euler product converges in the right half of the critical strip. EOS When this result is combined with the functional equation, the non-trivial zeros are constrained to lie on the critical line.	We argue that this _EQN_ growth is a consequence of the series behaving like a one-dimensional random walk.
doc	A multiwavelength study of the Magellanic-type galaxy NGC 4449 - I. Modelling the spectral energy distribution, the ionization structure and the star formation history EOS [Abridged] We present an integrated photometric spectral energy distribution (SED) of the Magellanic-type galaxy NGC 4449 from the far-ultraviolet (UV) to the submillimetre, including new observations acquired by the Herschel Space Observatory. EOS We include integrated UV photometry from the Swift Ultraviolet and Optical Telescope using a measurement technique which is appropriate for extended sources with coincidence loss. EOS In this paper, we examine the available multiwavelength data to infer a range of ages, metallicities and star formation rates for the underlying stellar populations, as well as the composition and the total mass of dust in NGC 4449. EOS We present an iterative scheme, which allows us to build an in-depth and multicomponent representation of NGC 4449 `bottom-up', taking advantage of the broad capabilities of the photoionization and radiative transfer code MOCASSIN (MOnte CArlo SimulationS of Ionized Nebulae). EOS We fit the observed SED, the global ionization structure and the emission line intensities, and infer a recent SFR of 0.4 Msolar/yr and a total stellar mass of approximately 1e9 Msolar emitting with a bolometric luminosity of 5.7e9 Lsolar. EOS Our fits yield a total dust mass of 2.9e6 Msolar including 2 per cent attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. EOS We deduce a dust to gas mass ratio of 1/190 within the modelled region.	While we do not consider possible additional contributions from even colder dust, we note that including the extended HI envelope and the molecular gas is likely to bring the ratio down to as low as ~ 1/800.
doc	General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of the Hard State as a Magnetically-Dominated Accretion Flow EOS (Abridged) We present one of the first physically-motivated two-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) numerical simulations of a radiatively-cooled black-hole accretion disk. EOS The fiducial simulation combines a total-energy-conserving formulation with a radiative cooling function, which includes bremsstrahlung, synchrotron, and Compton effects. EOS By comparison with other simulations we show that in optically thin advection-dominated accretion flows, radiative cooling can significantly affect the structure, without necessarily leading to an optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. EOS We further compare the results of our radiatively-cooled simulation to the predictions of a previously developed analytic model for such flows.	For the very low stress parameter and accretion rate found in our simulated disk, we closely match a state called the "transition" solution between an outer advection-dominated accretion flow and what would be a magnetically-dominated accretion flow (MDAF) in the interior.
doc	On the application of fracture mechanics mixed-mode models of sliding with friction and adhesion EOS As recently suggested in an interestring and stimulating paper by Menga, Carbone & Dini (MCD), applying fracture mechanics energy concepts for the case of a sliding adhesive contact, imposing also the shear stress is constant at the interface and equal to a material constant (as it seems in experiments), leads to a increase of contact area which instead is never observed. EOS We add that the rigorous MCD theory also predict a size effect and hence a distortion of the JKR curve during sliding which is also not observed in experiments. EOS Finally, a simpler example with the pure mode I contact case, leads in the MCD theory to an unbounded contact area, which is difficult to interpret, rather than a perhaps more correct limit of the Maugis-Dugdale solution for the adhesive sphere when Tabor parameter is zero, that is DMT's solution.	We discuss therefore the implications of the MCD theory, although they may be rather academic: recent semi-empirical models, with an appropriate choice of the empirical parameters, seem more promising and robust in modelling actual experiments.

doc	The Skewness of the Aperture Mass Statistic EOS We present simple formulae for calculating the skewness and kurtosis of the aperture mass statistic for weak lensing surveys which is insensitive to masking effects of survey geometry or variable survey depth. EOS The calculation is the higher order analog of the formula given by Schneider et al (2002) which has been used to compute the variance of the aperture mass from several lensing surveys. EOS As our formula requires the three-point shear correlation function, we also present an efficient tree-based algorithm for measuring it. EOS We show how our algorithm would scale in computing time and memory usage for future lensing surveys. EOS Finally, we apply the procedure to our CTIO survey data, originally described in Jarvis et al (2003). EOS We find that the skewness is positive (inconsistent with zero) at the 2 sigma level.	However, the signal is too noisy from this data to usefully constrain cosmology.
doc	Driver Behavior Modelling at the Urban Intersection via Canonical Correlation Analysis EOS The urban intersection is a typically dynamic and complex scenario for intelligent vehicles, which exists a variety of driving behaviors and traffic participants. EOS Accurately modelling the driver behavior at the intersection is essential for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). EOS Previous researches mainly focus on using attention mechanism to model the degree of correlation. EOS In this research, a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-based framework is proposed. EOS The value of canonical correlation is used for feature selection.	Gaussian mixture model and Gaussian process regression are applied for driver behavior modelling.

If the answer is missing or unavailable in the database, then graph-pattern association rules are used to get the answer.
doc	The Association of the Moon and the Sun with Large Earthquakes EOS The role of the moon in triggering earthquakes has been studied since the early 1900s. EOS Theory states that as land tides swept by the moon cross fault lines, stress in the Earth's plates intensifies, increasing the likelihood of small earthquakes. EOS This paper studied the association of the moon and sun with larger magnitude earthquakes (magnitude 5 and greater) using a worldwide dataset from the USGS. EOS Initially, the positions of the moon and sun were considered separately. EOS The moon showed a reduction of 1.74% (95% confidence) in earthquakes when it was 10 hours behind a longitude on earth and a 1.62% increase when it was 6 hours behind. EOS The sun revealed even weaker associations (<1%). EOS Binning the data in 6 hours quadrants (matching natural tide cycles) reduced the associations further. EOS However, combinations of moon-sun positions displayed significant associations. EOS Cycling the moon and sun in all possible quadrant permutations showed a decrease in earthquakes when they were paired together on the East and West horizons of an earthquake longitude (4.57% and 2.31% reductions). EOS When the moon and sun were on opposite sides of a longitude, there was often a small (about 1%) increase in earthquakes.	Reducing the bin size from 6 hours to 1 hour produced noisy results.
doc	Point contact spectroscopy in the superconducting and normal state of _EQN_ EOS We use point contact spectroscopy to probe the superconducting and normal state properties of the iron-based superconductor _EQN_ with _EQN_. EOS Andreev spectra corresponding to multiple superconducting gaps are detected in the superconducting phase. EOS For _EQN_, a broad conductance enhancement around zero bias voltage is detected in both the normal and the superconducting phase. EOS Such a feature is not present in the _EQN_ samples. EOS We suspect that this enhancement is caused by orbital fluctuations, as previously detected in underdoped _EQN_ (Phys. EOS Rev.	B 85, 214515 (2012)).
doc	Halo stars in the immediate solar neighbourhood EOS We have searched the Forth Catalogue of Nearby Stars for halo stars and identified 15 subdwarfs and a high velocity white dwarf in the solar neighbourhood. EOS This search was motivated mainly by the recent determinations of MACHO masses of about 0.5 M_sun, which are typical for halo dwarfs. EOS The local mass density of the stars is 1.5 10^ -4 M_sun pc^ -3, which is only 3% of the current estimate of the local mass density of the MACHO population. EOS We compare the local density of subdwarfs with constraints set by HST observations of distant red dwarfs.	Using models of the stellar halo with density laws that fall off like r^ -\alpha, \alpha = 3.5 to 4, we find that the HST constraints can only be matched, if we assume that the stellar halo is flattened with an axial ratio of about 0.6.
doc	Numerical simulations of granular dynamics II. Particle dynamics in a shaken granular material EOS Surfaces of planets and small bodies of our Solar System are often covered by a layer of granular material that can range from a fine regolith to a gravel-like structure of varying depths. EOS Therefore, the dynamics of granular materials are involved in many events occurring during planetary and small-body evolution thus contributing to their geological properties. EOS We demonstrate that the new adaptation of the parallel N-body hard-sphere code pkdgrav has the capability to model accurately the key features of the collective motion of bidisperse granular materials in a dense regime as a result of shaking. EOS As a stringent test of the numerical code we investigate the complex collective ordering and motion of granular material by direct comparison with laboratory experiments. EOS We demonstrate that, as experimentally observed, the scale of the collective motion increases with increasing small-particle additive concentration. EOS We then extend our investigations to assess how self-gravity and external gravity affect collective motion. EOS In our reduced-gravity simulations both the gravitational conditions and the frequency of the vibrations roughly match the conditions on asteroids subjected to seismic shaking, though real regolith is likely to be much more heterogeneous and less ordered than in our idealised simulations.	We also show that collective motion can occur in a granular material under a wide range of inter-particle gravity conditions and in the absence of an external gravitational field.
doc	Newforms and Spectral Multiplicities for _EQN_ EOS The goal of this paper is to explain certain experimentally observed properties of the (cuspidal) spectrum and its associated automorphic forms (Maass waveforms) on the congruence subgroup _EQN_. EOS The first property is that the spectrum possesses multiplicities in the so-called new part, where it was previously believed to be simple. EOS The second property is that the spectrum does not contain any "genuinely new" eigenvalues, in the sense that all eigenvalues of _EQN_ appear in the spectrum of some congruence subgroup of lower level. EOS The main theorem in this paper gives a precise decomposition of the spectrum of _EQN_ and in particular we show that the genuinely new part is empty.	We also prove that there exist an infinite number of eigenvalues of _EQN_ where the corresponding eigenspace is of dimension at least two and has a basis of pairs of Hecke-Maass newforms which are related to each other by a character twist.

The Periodic Orbits Approach EOS We develop diagnostics to detect the presence and orientation of a bar in an edge-on disk, using its kinematical signature in the position-velocity diagram (PVD) of a spiral galaxy observed edge-on.	Using a well-studied barred spiral galaxy mass model, we briefly review the orbital properties of two-dimensional non-axisymmetric disks and identify the main families of periodic orbits.

doc	X-rays from Proton Bremsstrahlung: Evidence from Fusion Reactors and Its Implication in Astrophysics EOS In a fusion reactor, a proton and a neutron generated in previous reactions may again fuse with each other. EOS Or they can in turn fuse with or be captured by an un-reacted deuteron. EOS The average center-of-mass (COM) energy for such reaction is around 10 keV in a typical fusion reactor, but could be as low as 1 keV. EOS At this low COM energy, the reacting nucleons are in an s-wave state in terms of their relative angular momentum. EOS The single-gamma radiation process is thus strongly suppressed due to conservation laws. EOS Instead the gamma ray released is likely to be accompanied by x-ray photons from a nuclear bremsstrahlung process. EOS The x-ray thus generated has a continuous spectrum and peaks around a few hundred eV to a few keV. EOS The average photon energy and spectrum properties of such a process are calculated with a semiclassical approach. EOS The results give a peak near 1.1 keV for the proton-deuteron fusion and a power-to-the-minus-second law in the spectrum's high-energy limit.	An analysis of some prior tokamak discharge data shows that this phenomenon might have been observed before and it may lead to new plasma diagnostics which are more sensitive to the ionic or nuclear degree of freedom.
doc	Dynamic Weighted Fairness with Minimal Disruptions EOS In this paper, we consider the following dynamic fair allocation problem: Given a sequence of job arrivals and departures, the goal is to maintain an approximately fair allocation of the resource against a target fair allocation policy, while minimizing the total number of disruptions, which is the number of times the allocation of any job is changed. EOS We consider a rich class of fair allocation policies that significantly generalize those considered in previous work. EOS We first consider the models where jobs only arrive, or jobs only depart. EOS We present tight upper and lower bounds for the number of disruptions required to maintain a constant approximate fair allocation every time step. EOS In particular, for the canonical case where jobs have weights and the resource allocation is proportional to the job's weight, we show that maintaining a constant approximate fair allocation requires _EQN_ disruptions per job, almost matching the bounds in prior work for the unit weight case. EOS For the more general setting where the allocation policy only decreases the allocation to a job when new jobs arrive, we show that maintaining a constant approximate fair allocation requires _EQN_ disruptions per job. EOS We then consider the model where jobs can both arrive and depart. EOS We first show strong lower bounds on the number of disruptions required to maintain constant approximate fairness for arbitrary instances.	In contrast we then show that there there is an algorithm that can maintain constant approximate fairness with _EQN_ expected disruptions per job if the weights of the jobs are independent of the jobs arrival and departure order.
doc	Geodesics in the (anti-)de Sitter spacetime EOS A class of exact solutions of the geodesic equations in (anti-)de Sitter AdS _EQN_ and dS _EQN_ spacetimes is presented. EOS The geodesics for test particles in AdS _EQN_ and dS _EQN_ spacetimes are respectively sinusoidal and hyperbolic sine world lines. EOS The world line for light rays is straight lines as known. EOS In particular, the world lines of test particles are not dependent on their energy. EOS Spontaneous symmetry breaking of AdS _EQN_ spacetime provides a physical explanation for arising of the virtual particle and antiparticle pairs in vacuum. EOS Interestingly, the energy of a pair and the time its particles moving along their geodesics can be related by a relation similar to Heisenberg uncertainty one pertaining quantum vacuum fluctuations. EOS The sinusoidal geodesics of AdS _EQN_ spacetime can describe the world lines of the virtual particles and antiparticles.	The hyperbolic sine geodesics of dS _EQN_ spacetime can explain why galaxies move apart with positive accelerations.

doc	Charm Antiquark and Charm Quark in the Nucleon EOS We estimate the intrinsic charm contributions to the quark flavor and spin observables of the nucleon in the SU(4) quark meson fluctuation model. EOS In this model, the charm or anticharm reside in the charmed mesons created by the nonperturbative quantum quark-meson fluctuations. EOS The intrinsic charm content in the proton, _EQN_, is almost one order of magnitude smaller than the intrinsic strange content.	The intrinsic charm helicity is also small and negative, _EQN_.
doc	Relative timing of solar flares observed at different wavelengths EOS The timing of 503 solar flares observed simultaneously in hard X-rays, soft X-rays and H-alpha is analyzed. EOS We investigated the start and the peak time differences in different wavelengths, as well as the differences between the end of the hard X-ray emission and the maximum of the soft X-ray and H-alpha emission. EOS In more than 90% of the analyzed events, a thermal preheating seen in soft X-rays is present prior to the impulsive flare phase. EOS On average, the soft X-ray emission starts 3 min before the hard X-ray and the H-alpha emission. EOS No correlation between the duration of the preheating phase and the importance of the subsequent flare is found. EOS Furthermore, the duration of the preheating phase does not differ for impulsive and gradual flares. EOS For at least half of the events, the end of the nonthermal emission coincides well with the maximum of the thermal emission, consistent with the beam-driven evaporation model.	On the other hand, for about 25% of the events there is strong evidence for prolonged evaporation beyond the end of the hard X-rays.
doc	Noncollinear magnetic phases and edge states in graphene quantum Hall bars EOS Application of a perpendicular magnetic field to charge neutral graphene is expected to result in a variety of broken symmetry phases, including antiferromagnetic, canted and ferromagnetic. EOS All these phases open a gap in bulk but have very different edge states and non-collinear spin order, recently confirmed experimentally. EOS Here we provide an integrated description of both edge and bulk for the various magnetic phases of graphene Hall bars making use of a non-collinear mean field Hubbard model.	Our calculations show that, at the edges, the three types of magnetic order are either enhanced (zigzag) or suppressed (armchair).
doc	Evolution of nuclear structure in and around Z=50 closed shell: Generalized Seniority in Cd, Sn and Te isotopes EOS We study the quadrupole moments and the B(E2; EOS _EQN_) values for the _EQN_ states and the first _EQN_ states, respectively, by using a multi-j generalized seniority approach in the Cd (Z = 48), Sn (Z = 50) and Te (Z = 52) isotopic chains. EOS The g-factor trends have also been discussed. EOS Although, Cd and Te isotopes represent two-proton hole and two-proton particle systems, thus involving both kind of particles (protons and neutrons) in contrast to Sn (Z = 50) where only neutrons play a role, we find that a similar model based on neutron valence space alone is able to explain nearly all the gross features and trends. EOS This paper represents the first attempt to test the validity of the generalized seniority scheme away from the semi-magic region and appears to be surprisingly successful. EOS The linearly varying quadrupole moments in Cd, Sn and Te isotopes, are described by using a consistent multi-j configuration. EOS The asymmetric double-hump behavior of B(E2) values in Cd and Te isotopes are understood in a manner identical to that of Sn isotopes by using the generalized seniority scheme for the first time.	No shell quenching is supported in the calculations;
doc	Gravitational Lensing of the X-Ray Background by Clusters of Galaxies EOS Gravitational lensing by clusters of galaxies affects the cosmic X-ray background (XRB) by altering the observed density and flux distribution of background X-ray sources. EOS At faint detection flux thresholds, the resolved X-ray sources appear brighter and diluted, while the unresolved component of the XRB appears dimmer and more anisotropic, due to lensing. EOS The diffuse X-ray intensity in the outer halos of clusters might be lower than the sky-averaged XRB, after the subtraction of resolved sources. EOS Detection of the lensing signal with a wide-field X-ray telescope could probe the mass distribution of a cluster out to its virialization boundary.	In particular, we show that the lensing signature imprinted on the resolved component of the XRB by the cluster A1689, should be difficult but possible to detect out to 8' at the 2-4 sigma level, after 10^6 seconds of observation with the forthcoming AXAF satellite.
doc	On parametric Gevrey asymptotics for singularly perturbed partial differential equations with delays EOS We study a family of singularly perturbed _EQN_ difference-differential equations in the complex domain.

For this purpose we introduce sheaves of _EQN_ -canonical and _EQN_ -canonical forms on normal complex spaces.

doc	Accretion and nuclear activity in Virgo early-type galaxies EOS We use Chandra observations to estimate the accretion rate of hot gas onto the central supermassive black hole in four giant (of stellar mass 10E11 - 10E12 solar masses) early-type galaxies located in the Virgo cluster. EOS They are characterized by an extremely low radio luminosity, in the range L < 3E25 - 10E27 erg/s/Hz. EOS We find that, accordingly, accretion in these objects occurs at an extremely low rate, 0.2 - 3.7 10E-3 solar masses per year, and that they smoothly extend the relation accretion - jet power found for more powerful radio-galaxies. EOS This confirms the dominant role of hot gas and of the galactic coronae in powering radio-loud active galactic nuclei across ~ 4 orders of magnitude in luminosity.	A suggestive trend between jet power and location within the cluster also emerges.

doc	New Constraints from High Redshift Supernovae and Lensing Statistics upon Scalar Field Cosmologies EOS We explore the implications of gravitationally lensed QSOs and high-redshift SNe Ia observations for spatially flat cosmological models in which a classically evolving scalar field currently dominates the energy density of the Universe. EOS We consider two representative scalar field potentials that give rise to effective decaying _EQN_ (``quintessence'') models: pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (_EQN_) and an inverse power-law potential (_EQN_). EOS We show that a large region of parameter space is consistent with current data if _EQN_.	On the other hand, a higher lower bound for the matter density parameter suggested by large-scale galaxy flows, _EQN_, considerably reduces the allowed parameter space, forcing the scalar field behavior to approach that of a cosmological constant.
doc	Role of Quantum-Confinement in Anatase Nanosheets EOS Despite most of the applications of anatase nanostructures rely on photoexcited charge processes, yet profound theoretical understanding of fundamental related properties is lacking. EOS Here, by means of ab initio ground and excited-state calculations, we reveal, in an unambiguous way, the role of quantum confinement effect and of the surface orientation, on the electronic and optical properties of anatase nanosheets (NSs). EOS The presence of bound excitons extremely localized along the (001) direction, whose existence has been recently proven also in anatase bulk, explains the different optical behavior found for the two orientations (001) and (101) when the NS thickness increases.	We suggest also that the almost two-dimensional nature of these excitons can be related to the improved photoconversion efficiency observed when a high percentage of (001) facet is present in anatase nanocrystals.
doc	Interface induced high temperature superconductivity in single unit-cell FeSe films on SrTiO3 EOS Searching for superconducting materials with high transition temperature (TC) is one of the most exciting and challenging fields in physics and materials science. EOS Although superconductivity has been discovered for more than 100 years, the copper oxides are so far the only materials with TC above 77 K, the liquid nitrogen boiling point. EOS Here we report an interface engineering method for dramatically raising the TC of superconducting films. EOS We find that one unit-cell (UC) thick films of FeSe grown on SrTiO3 (STO) substrates by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) show signatures of superconducting transition above 50 K by transport measurement. EOS A superconducting gap as large as 20 meV of the 1 UC films observed by scanning tunneling microcopy (STM) suggests that the superconductivity could occur above 77 K.	The occurrence of superconductivity is further supported by the presence of superconducting vortices under magnetic field.
doc	Tunable site- and orbital-selective Mott transition and quantum confinement effects in La _EQN_ Ca _EQN_ MnO _EQN_ nanoclusters EOS We present a dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) study of the charge and orbital correlations in finite-size La _EQN_ Ca _EQN_ MnO _EQN_ (LCMO) nanoclusters. EOS Upon nanostructuring LCMO to clusters of 3 nm diameter, the size reduction induces an insulator-to-metal transition in the high-temperature paramagnetic phase. EOS This is ascribed to the reduction in charge disproportionation between Mn sites with different nominal valence [Das et al, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett.	107, 197202 (2011)].
doc	Distributed Position Localization and Tracking (DPLT) of Malicious Nodes in Cluster Based Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) EOS In this paper, a robust distributed malicious node detection and precise localization and tracking method is proposed for Cluster based Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET). EOS Certificate Authority (CA) node is selected as the most stable node among trusted nodes, surrounded by Registration Authority nodes (RAs) in each cluster to generate the Dynamic Demilitarized Zone (DDMZ) to defend CA from probable attackers and mitigate the authentication overhead. EOS The RAs also co-operate with member nodes to detect a target node and determine whether it is malicious or not, by providing the public key certificate and trust value. EOS In addition, Internet Protocol (IP) based Triangulation and multi-lateration method are deployed based on using the average time difference of Time of Arrival (ToA) and Time of Departure (ToD) of the management packets. EOS Triangulation uses three reference nodes which are elected within each cluster based on Best Criterion Function (BCF) to localize each member node inside the cluster in 2D. EOS Multi-lateration is employed to localize the malicious target node in 2D using four neighbor nodes.	After localization of two consecutive positions, the target node is continuously localized and tracked by a particular node using the modified real time Position Localization and Tracking (PL&T) algorithm by adaptive beam forming and mapping the energy contours of tracking zone into coverage radii distance.
doc	DuDoNet: Dual Domain Network for CT Metal Artifact Reduction EOS Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging modality widely used for medical diagnosis and treatment.

Existing methods for reducing the artifacts due to metallic implants are inadequate for two main reasons.
doc	Mrk 1014: An AGN Dominated ULIRG at X-rays EOS In this paper we report on an XMM-Newton observation of the ultraluminous infrared QSO Mrk 1014. EOS The X-ray observation reveals a power-law dominated (photon index of about 2.2) spectrum with a slight excess in the soft energy range. EOS AGN and starburst emission models fit the soft excess emission equally well, however, the most plausible explanation is an AGN component as the starburst model parameter, temperature and luminosity, appear physically unrealistic. EOS The mean luminosity of Mrk 1014 is about 2 times 10^44 erg s^-1. EOS We have also observed excess emission at energies greater than 5 keV. EOS This feature could be attributed to a broadened and redshifted iron complex, but deeper observations are required to constrain its origin. EOS The light curve shows small scale variability over the 11 ks observation. EOS There is no evidence of intrinsic absorption in Mrk 1014.	The X-ray observations support the notion of an AGN dominated central engine.
doc	Outstanding Problems in Particle Astrophysics EOS The general features of the cosmic-ray spectrum have been known for a long time.

doc	Bell Inequalities for Continuously Emitting Sources EOS A common experimental strategy for demonstrating non-classical correlations is to show violation of a Bell inequality by measuring a continuously emitted stream of entangled photon pairs. EOS The measurements involve the detection of photons by two spatially separated parties. EOS The detection times are recorded and compared to quantify the violation. EOS The violation critically depends on determining which detections are coincident. EOS Because the recorded detection times have "jitter", coincidences cannot be inferred perfectly.	In the presence of settings-dependent timing errors, this can allow a local-realistic system to show apparent violation--the so-called "coincidence loophole".
doc	Approximate Privacy: Foundations and Quantification EOS Increasing use of computers and networks in business, government, recreation, and almost all aspects of daily life has led to a proliferation of online sensitive data about individuals and organizations. EOS Consequently, concern about the privacy of these data has become a top priority, particularly those data that are created and used in electronic commerce. EOS There have been many formulations of privacy and, unfortunately, many negative results about the feasibility of maintaining privacy of sensitive data in realistic networked environments. EOS We formulate communication-complexity-based definitions, both worst-case and average-case, of a problem's privacy-approximation ratio. EOS We use our definitions to investigate the extent to which approximate privacy is achievable in two standard problems: the second-price Vickrey auction and the millionaires problem of Yao. EOS For both the second-price Vickrey auction and the millionaires problem, we show that not only is perfect privacy impossible or infeasibly costly to achieve, but even close approximations of perfect privacy suffer from the same lower bounds. EOS By contrast, we show that, if the values of the parties are drawn uniformly at random from 0,...,2^k-1, then, for both problems, simple and natural communication protocols have privacy-approximation ratios that are linear in k (i.e., logarithmic in the size of the space of possible inputs).	We conjecture that this improved privacy-approximation ratio is achievable for any probability distribution.
doc	An Entropy Search Portfolio for Bayesian Optimization EOS Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient method for black-box global optimization. EOS How- ever, the performance of a Bayesian optimization method very much depends on its exploration strategy, i.e. EOS the choice of acquisition function, and it is not clear a priori which choice will result in superior performance. EOS While portfolio methods provide an effective, principled way of combining a collection of acquisition functions, they are often based on measures of past performance which can be misleading. EOS To address this issue, we introduce the Entropy Search Portfolio (ESP): a novel approach to portfolio construction which is motivated by information theoretic considerations. EOS We show that ESP outperforms existing portfolio methods on several real and synthetic problems, including geostatistical datasets and simulated control tasks. EOS We not only show that ESP is able to offer performance as good as the best, but unknown, acquisition function, but surprisingly it often gives better performance.	Finally, over a wide range of conditions we find that ESP is robust to the inclusion of poor acquisition functions.
doc	Aggregating Large-Scale Generalized Energy Storages to Participate in Energy Market and Regulation Market EOS This paper proposes a concept of generalized energy storage (GES) to facilitate the integration of large-scale heterogeneous flexible resources with electric/thermal energy storage capacity to participate in multiple markets. EOS First, a generalized state variable referred to as degree of satisfaction (DoS) is defined, and dynamic models with a unified form are derived for different types of GESs. EOS Second, a real-time market-based coordination framework is proposed to facilitate control, and ensure user privacy and device security. EOS Demand curves of different GESs are then developed based on DoS to express their demand urgencies as well as flexibilities.	Furthermore, a low-dimensional aggregate dynamic model of a GES cluster is derived thanks to the DoS-equality control feature provided by the design of demand curve.
doc	Inferring Treatment Effects After Testing Instrument Strength in Linear Models EOS A common practice in IV studies is to check for instrument strength, i.e. EOS its association to the treatment, with an F-test from regression. EOS If the F-statistic is above some threshold, usually 10, the instrument is deemed to satisfy one of the three core IV assumptions and used to test for the treatment effect. EOS However, in many cases, the inference on the treatment effect does not take into account the strength test done a priori. EOS In this paper, we show that not accounting for this pretest can severely distort the distribution of the test statistic and propose a method to correct this distortion, producing valid inference.	A key insight in our method is to frame the F-test as a randomized convex optimization problem and to leverage recent methods in selective inference.
doc	Why is a noble metal catalytically active? The role of the O-Ag interaction in the function of silver as an oxidation catalyst EOS Extensive density-functional theory calculations, and taking into account temperature and pressure, affords a comprehensive picture of the behavior and interaction of oxygen and Ag(111), and provides valuable insight into the function of silver as an oxidation catalyst. EOS The obtained phase-diagram reveals the most stable species present in a given environment and thus identifies (and excludes) possibly active oxygen species.	In particular, for the conditions of ethylene epoxidation, a thin oxide-like structure is most stable, suggesting that such atomic O species are actuating the catalysis, in contrast to hitherto proposed molecular-like species.
doc	Early Optical Observations of GRB 150910A: Bright Jet Optical Afterglow and X-ray Dipole Radiation from a Magnetar Central Engine EOS Gamma-ray burst (GRB) 150910A was detected by Swift /BAT, and then rapidly observed by Swift /XRT, Swift /UVOT, and ground-based telescopes. EOS We report Lick Observatory spectroscopic and photometric observations of GRB~150910A, and we investigate the physical origins of both the optical and X-ray afterglows, incorporating data obtained with BAT and XRT. EOS The light curves show that the jet emission episode lasts _EQN_ ~s with a sharp pulse from BAT to XRT (Episode I). EOS In Episode II, the optical emission has a smooth onset bump followed by a normal decay (_EQN_), as predicted in the standard external shock model, while the X-ray emission exhibits a plateau (_EQN_) followed by a steep decay (_EQN_). EOS The light curves show obvious chromatic behavior with an excess in the X-ray flux. EOS Our results suggest that GRB 150910A is an unusual GRB driven by a newly-born magnetar with its extremely energetic magnetic dipole (MD) wind in Episode II, which overwhelmingly dominates the observed early X-ray plateau. EOS The radiative efficiency of the jet prompt emission is _EQN_. EOS The MD wind emission was detected in both the BAT and XRT bands, making it the brightest among the current sample of MD winds seen by XRT.	We infer the initial spin period (_EQN_) and the surface polar cap magnetic field strength (_EQN_) of the magnetar as _EQN_ and 1~ms _EQN_ ~ms, and the radiative efficiency of the wind is _EQN_.
doc	A Foray into Efficient Mapping of Algorithms to Hardware Platforms on Heterogeneous Systems EOS Heterogeneous computing can potentially offer significant performance and performance per watt improvements over homogeneous computing, but the question "what is the ideal mapping of algorithms to architectures? EOS " remains an open one. EOS In the past couple of years new types of computing devices such as FPGAs have come into general computing use. EOS In this work we attempt to add to the body of scientific knowledge by comparing Kernel performance and performance per watt of seven key algorithms according to Berkley's dwarf taxonomy.	We do so using the Rodinia benchmark suite on three different high-end hardware architecture representatives from the CPU, GPU and FPGA families.
doc	HST-COS Observations of Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon and Nitrogen Emission from the SN 1987A Reverse Shock EOS We present the most sensitive ultraviolet observations of Supernova 1987A to date. EOS Imaging spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope-Cosmic Origins Spectrograph shows many narrow (dv \sim 300 km/s) emission lines from the circumstellar ring, broad (dv \sim 10 -- 20 x 10^3 km/s) emission lines from the reverse shock, and ultraviolet continuum emission. EOS The high signal-to-noise (> 40 per resolution element) broad LyA emission is excited by soft X-ray and EUV heating of mostly neutral gas in the circumstellar ring and outer supernova debris. EOS The ultraviolet continuum at \lambda > 1350A can be explained by HI 2-photon emission from the same region. EOS We confirm our earlier, tentative detection of NV \lambda 1240 emission from the reverse shock and we present the first detections of broad HeII \lambda1640, CIV \lambda1550, and NIV] \lambda1486 emission lines from the reverse shock. EOS The helium abundance in the high-velocity material is He/H = 0.14 +/- 0.06. EOS The NV/H-alpha line ratio requires partial ion-electron equilibration (T_ e /T_ p \approx 0.14 - 0.35). EOS We find that the N/C abundance ratio in the gas crossing the reverse shock is significantly higher than that in the circumstellar ring, a result that may be attributed to chemical stratification in the outer envelope of the supernova progenitor.	The N/C abundance ratio may have been stratified prior to the ring expulsion, or this result may indicate continued CNO processing in the progenitor subsequent to the expulsion of the circumstellar ring.

EOS The problem can be easily solved in time _EQN_, making it fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to _EQN_.	While the fastest known algorithm takes only time _EQN_, much stronger improvements have been obtained by studying parameters that are smaller than _EQN_.

doc	Strong-coupling-expansion analysis of the false-vacuum decay rate of the lattice phi^4 model in 1+1 dimensions EOS Strong-coupling expansion is performed for the lattice phi^4 model in 1+1 dimensions. EOS Because the strong-coupling limit itself is not solvable, we employed numerical calculations so as to set up unperturbed eigensystems. EOS Restricting the number of Hilbert-space bases, we performed linked-cluster expansion up to eleventh order. EOS We carried out alternative simulation by means of the density-matrix renormalization group. EOS Thereby, we confirmed that our series-expansion data with a convergence-acceleration trick are in good agreement with the simulation result. EOS Through the analytic continuation to the domain of negative biquadratic interaction, we obtain the false-vacuum decay rate.	Contrary to common belief that tunnelling phenomenon lies out of perturbative treatments, our series expansion reproduces the instanton-theory behaviour for high potential barrier.

doc	Vandermonde Matrices with Nodes in the Unit Disk and the Large Sieve EOS We derive bounds on the extremal singular values and the condition number of NxK, with N>=K, Vandermonde matrices with nodes in the unit disk. EOS The mathematical techniques we develop to prove our main results are inspired by a link---first established by by Selberg  and later extended by Moitra ---between the extremal singular values of Vandermonde matrices with nodes on the unit circle and large sieve inequalities.	Our main conceptual contribution lies in establishing a connection between the extremal singular values of Vandermonde matrices with nodes in the unit disk and a novel large sieve inequality involving polynomials in z \in C with |z|<=1.
doc	InstanceMotSeg: Real-time Instance Motion Segmentation for Autonomous Driving EOS Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for autonomous vehicles as it can be used to segment objects in a class agnostic manner based on its motion cues. EOS It will enable the detection of objects unseen during training (e.g., moose or a construction truck) generically based on their motion. EOS Although pixel-wise motion segmentation has been studied in the literature, it is not dealt with at instance level, which would help separate connected segments of moving objects leading to better trajectory planning.	In this paper, we proposed a motion-based instance segmentation task and created a new annotated dataset based on KITTI, which will be released publicly.

doc	Chandra X-ray Grating Spectrometry of Eta Carinae near X-ray Minimum: I. Variability of the Sulfur and Silicon Emission Lines EOS We report on variations in important X-ray emission lines in a series of Chandra grating spectra of the supermassive colliding wind binary star Eta Carinae, including key phases around the X-ray minimum/periastron passage in 2003.5. EOS The X-rays arise from the collision of the slow, dense wind of Eta Car with the fast, low-density wind of an otherwise hidden companion star. EOS The X-ray emission lines provide the only direct measure of the flow dynamics of the companion's wind along the wind-wind collision zone. EOS We concentrate here on the silicon and sulfur lines, which are the strongest and best resolved lines in the X-ray spectra. EOS Most of the line profiles can be adequately fit with symmetric Gaussians with little significant skewness. EOS Both the silicon and sulfur lines show significant velocity shifts and correlated increases in line widths through the observations. EOS The R = forbidden-to-intercombination ratio from the Si XIII and S XV triplets is near or above the low-density limit in all observations, suggesting that the line-forming region is >1.6 stellar radii from the companion star. EOS We show that simple geometrical models cannot simultaneously fit both the observed centroid variations and changes in line width as a function of phase. EOS We show that the observed profiles can be fitted with synthetic profiles with a reasonable model of the emissivity along the wind-wind collision boundary.	We use this analysis to help constrain the line formation region as a function of orbital phase, and the orbital geometry.
doc	Biological implications of dynamical phases in non-equilibrium networks EOS Biology achieves novel functions like error correction, ultra-sensitivity and accurate concentration measurement at the expense of free energy through Maxwell Demon-like mechanisms. EOS The design principles and free energy trade-offs have been studied for a variety of such mechanisms. EOS In this review, we emphasize a perspective based on dynamical phases that can explain commonalities shared by these mechanisms. EOS Dynamical phases are defined by typical trajectories executed by non-equilibrium systems in the space of internal states.	We find that coexistence of dynamical phases can have dramatic consequences for function vs free energy cost trade-offs.

doc	Utilization of the Transverse Deflecting RF Cavities in the Designed QBA Lattice of the 3 GeV Taiwan Photon Source EOS A pair of superconducting transverse deflecting RF cavities has been studied in the QBA low emittance lattices of the 3 GeV TPS for generating ultra short X-ray pulses. EOS Three configurations with different locations for the two cavities in a super-period of the TPS ring are investigated. EOS During numerous turns of the electron tracking, the nonlinear effects between the cavities, the energy spread, the momentum compaction factor, and the synchrotron radiation effects are taken into account. EOS The configuration with positioning the RF deflectors between the QBA cells in each super-period as an optimum arrangement gives rise to better quality electron bunches and radiated photon pulses. EOS The FWHM of the radiated photon pulses of about 540 fs with an acceptable intensity is attained by optimizing the compression optical elements of the TPS photon beam line. EOS Furthermore, the effects of the electron bunch length are studied by alternatively employing an accelerating RF cavity operating with 1.1 MV and 3.0 MV, respectively. EOS The operation of the accelerating RF cavity at 3.0 MV improved the intensity of the photon pulses up to 30% and reduced the equilibrium vertical emittance down to 70 pm-rad.	The error tolerance for the deflecting cavities, QBA lattice and injection process are also evaluated.

EOS We discuss the various possible origins of this very peculiar wavelength shift in the light of the particular physical conditions in the Orion Trapezium.	The above mentioned shift is seemingly absent in the DIBs at 6196 and 6993 \AA.
doc	The onset of electron-only reconnection EOS Motivated by recent observations of "electron-only" magnetic reconnection, without an ion-scale sheet or ion outflows, in both the Earth's magnetosheath and in numerical simulations, we study the formation and reconnection of electron-scale current sheets at low plasma beta. EOS We first show that ideal sheets collapse to thicknesses much smaller than the ion scales, by deriving an appropriate analogue of the Chapman-Kendall collapse solution. EOS Second, we show that, in practice, reconnection onset happens in these collapsing sheets once they reach a critical aspect ratio, because the tearing instability then becomes faster than their collapse timescale. EOS We show that this can happen for sheet thicknesses larger than the ion scale or at only a few times the electron scale, depending on plasma parameters and the aspect ratio of the collapsing structure, thereby unifying the usual picture of ion-coupled reconnection and the new regime of electron-only reconnection.	%and thus the usual picture of ion-coupled reconnection and the new regime of electron-only reconnection can be unified.

doc	Bases and Structure Constants of Generalized Splines with Integer Coefficients on Cycles EOS An integer generalized spline is a set of vertex labels on an edge-labeled graph that satisfy the condition that if two vertices are joined by an edge, the vertex labels are congruent modulo the edge label. EOS Foundational work on these objects comes from Gilbert, Polster, and Tymoczko, who generalize ideas from geometry/topology (equivariant cohomology rings) and algebra (algebraic splines) to develop the notion of generalized splines. EOS Gilbert, Polster, and Tymoczko prove that the ring of splines on a graph can be decomposed in terms of splines on its subgraphs (in particular, on trees and cycles), and then fully analyze splines on trees. EOS Following Handschy-Melnick-Reinders and Rose, we analyze splines on cycles, in our case integer generalized splines.	The primary goal of this paper is to establish two new bases for the module of integer generalized splines on cycles: the triangulation basis and the King basis.
doc	A Framework for Data-Driven Computational Dynamics Based on Nonlinear Optimization EOS In this article, we present an extension of the formulation recently developed by the authors (A Framework for Data-Driven Computational Mechanics Based on Nonlinear Optimization, arXiv:1910.12736 [math.NA]) to the structural dynamics setting. EOS Inspired by a structure-preserving family of variational integrators, our new formulation relies on a discrete balance equation that establishes the dynamic equilibrium. EOS From this point of departure, we first derive an "exact" discrete-continuous nonlinear optimization problem that works directly with data sets.	We then develop this formulation further into an "approximate" nonlinear optimization problem that relies on a general constitutive model.
doc	The Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier (PREA) and the mean earth s ground temperature EOS From the radiation balance diagram illustrating the IPCC reports one can estimate the power received by Earth from the sun at Pin = 342 W/m2 and the power consumed, remitted and reflected by the earth and its atmosphere at Pout = 599 kW/m2. EOS It seems that the earth emits more power than it receives. EOS The earth s ground mean temperature is estimated at 15 C. EOS A calculation based on the black body radiation theory gives an earth s ground mean temperature of the order of -18 C which is much lower than 15 C. EOS The important gap between these calculated and estimated temperature mean values requires an explanation. EOS Here we show that a gray body separated from vacuum by an interface and submitted to outside incident radiation can behave like a Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier. EOS The Earth which is a gray body separated from the space by an interface, behaves like a Pseudo Radiation Energy Amplifier. EOS The balance of the energy exchanged between Earth and outer space is reconsidered and the 15 C Earth s ground temperature mean value is then derived.	Our result revives the discussion on the parameters that control the Earth climate.

doc	Torsion effects on a relativistic position-dependent mass system EOS We analyse a relativistic scalar particle with a position-dependent mass in a spacetime with a space-like dislocation by showing that relativistic bound states solutions can be achieved. EOS Further, we consider the presence of the Coulomb potential and analyse the relativistic position-dependent mass system subject to the Coulomb potential in the spacetime with a space-like dislocation. EOS We also show that a new set of relativistic bound states solutions can be obtained, where there also exists the influence of torsion of the relativistic energy levels.	Finally, we investigate an analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for bound states in this position-dependent mass in a spacetime with a space-like dislocation.

EOS We provide dynamic programming results for continuous-time finite-horizon control and specialize these results to solve a noisy-time variant of the linear quadratic regulator problem and a portfolio optimization problem with random trade activity rates.	For the linear quadratic case, the optimal controller is linear and can be computed from a generalization of the classical Riccati differential equation.

doc	Entropy driven formation of a half-quantum vortex lattice EOS Half-quantum vortices (HQVs) can exist in a superconductor or superfluid with an exact or approximate U(1) \times U(1) symmetry, for instance in spinor condensates, 3He-A, Sr2RuO4, and possibly cuprate superconductors with stripe order. EOS In this paper, we show that a lattice of HQVs can be stabilized at finite temperature even when it does not have lower energy than the lattice of full vortices at T = 0 since there is a gain in configurational entropy when a full vortex fractionalizes into a pair of HQVs. EOS Specifically, the lattice of HQVs has an optical branch of phonon modes absent in the lattice of full vortices.	Moreover, the HQV lattice at T > 0 can have a different structure than the HQV lattice at T = 0.
doc	On the computational tractability of a geographic clustering problem arising in redistricting EOS Redistricting is the problem of dividing a state into a number _EQN_ of regions, called districts. EOS Voters in each district elect a representative. EOS The primary criteria are: each district is connected, district populations are equal (or nearly equal), and districts are "compact". EOS There are multiple competing definitions of compactness, usually minimizing some quantity. EOS One measure that has been recently promoted by Duchin and others is number of cut edges. EOS In redistricting, one is given atomic regions out of which each district must be built. EOS The populations of the atomic regions are given. EOS Consider the graph with one vertex per atomic region (with weight equal to the region's population) and an edge between atomic regions that share a boundary. EOS A districting plan is a partition of vertices into _EQN_ parts, each connnected, of nearly equal weight. EOS The districts are considered compact to the extent that the plan minimizes the number of edges crossing between different parts. EOS Consider two problems: find the most compact districting plan, and sample districting plans under a compactness constraint uniformly at random. EOS Both problems are NP-hard so we restrict the input graph to have branchwidth at most _EQN_. EOS (A planar graph's branchwidth is bounded by its diameter.) If both _EQN_ and _EQN_ are bounded by constants, the problems are solvable in polynomial time. EOS Assume vertices have weight~1. EOS One would like algorithms whose running times are of the form _EQN_ for some constant _EQN_ independent of _EQN_ and _EQN_, in which case the problems are said to be fixed-parameter tractable with respect to _EQN_ and _EQN_). EOS We show that, under a complexity-theoretic assumption, no such algorithms exist. EOS However, we do give algorithms with running time _EQN_.	Thus if the diameter of the graph is moderately small and the number of districts is very small, our algorithm is useable.
doc	Lower bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Steklov problem on graphs EOS We give lower bounds for the first non-zero Steklov eigenvalue on connected graphs. EOS These bounds depend on the extrinsic diameter of the boundary and not on the diameter of the graph. EOS We obtain a lower bound which is sharp when the cardinal of the boundary is 2, and asymptotically sharp as the diameter of the boundary tends to infinity in the other cases.	We also investigate the case of weigthed graphs and compare our result to the Cheeger inequality.
doc	Electromagnetic cascade masquerade: a way to mimic _EQN_ --axion-like particle mixing effects in blazar spectra EOS Context. EOS Most of the studies on extragalactic \gamma -ray propagation performed up to now only accounted for primary gamma-ray absorption and adiabatic losses ("absorption-only model"). EOS However, there is growing evidence that this model is oversimplified and must be modified in some way. EOS In particular, it was found that the intensity extrapolated from the optically-thin energy range of some blazar spectra is insufficient to explain the optically-thick part of these spectra. EOS This effect was interpreted as an indication for \gamma -axion-like particle (ALP) oscillation. EOS On the other hand, there are many hints that a secondary component from electromagnetic cascades initiated by primary \gamma -rays or nuclei may be observed in the spectra of some blazars. EOS Aims.	We study the impact of electromagnetic cascades from primary \gamma -rays or protons on the physical interpretation of blazar spectra obtained with imaging Cherenkov telescopes.
doc	DeFraudNet:End2End Fingerprint Spoof Detection using Patch Level Attention EOS In recent years, fingerprint recognition systems have made remarkable advancements in the field of biometric security as it plays an important role in personal, national and global security. EOS In spite of all these notable advancements, the fingerprint recognition technology is still susceptible to spoof attacks which can significantly jeopardize the user security. EOS The cross sensor and cross material spoof detection still pose a challenge with a myriad of spoof materials emerging every day, compromising sensor interoperability and robustness. EOS This paper proposes a novel method for fingerprint spoof detection using both global and local fingerprint feature descriptors. EOS These descriptors are extracted using DenseNet which significantly improves cross-sensor, cross-material and cross-dataset performance. EOS A novel patch attention network is used for finding the most discriminative patches and also for network fusion. EOS We evaluate our method on four publicly available datasets:LivDet 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017. EOS A set of comprehensive experiments are carried out to evaluate cross-sensor, cross-material and cross-dataset performance over these datasets.	The proposed approach achieves an average accuracy of 99.52%, 99.16% and 99.72% on LivDet 2017,2015 and 2011 respectively outperforming the current state-of-the-art results by 3% and 4% for LivDet 2015 and 2011 respectively.

doc	Angular dependence of magnetoresistivity in c-oriented MgB2 thin film EOS The anisotropy of MgB2 is still under debate: its value, strongly dependent on the sample and on the measuring method, ranges between 1.2 and 13. EOS In this work we present our results on a MgB2 c-oriented superconducting thin film. EOS To evaluate the anisotropy, we followed two different approaches. EOS Firstly, magnetoresistivity was measured as a function of temperature at selected magnetic fields applied both parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis; EOS secondly, we measured magnetoresistivity at selected temperatures and magnetic fields, varying the angle q between the magnetic field and the c-axis.	The anisotropy estimated from the ratio between the upper critical fields parallel and perpendicular to the c-axis and the one obtained in the framework of the scaling approach within the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory are different but show a similar trend in the temperature dependence.

doc	Shaping the Internet: 10 Years of IXP Growth EOS Over the past decade, IXPs have been playing a key role in enabling interdomain connectivity. EOS Their traffic volumes have grown dramatically and their physical presence has spread throughout the world. EOS While the relevance of IXPs is undeniable, their long-term contribution to the shaping of the current Internet is not fully understood yet. EOS In this paper, we look into the impact on Internet routes of the intense IXP growth over the last decade. EOS We observe that while in general IXPs only have a small effect in path shortening, very large networks do enjoy a clear IXP-enabled path reduction. EOS We also observe a diversion of the routes, away from the central Tier-1 ASes supported by IXPs.	Interestingly, we also find that whereas IXP membership has grown, large and central ASes have steadily moved away from public IXP peerings, whereas smaller ones have embraced them.

doc	Reanalysis of the Radii of the Benchmark Eclipsing Binary V578 Mon EOS V578 Mon is an eclipsing binary system in which both stars have masses above 10 Msun determined with an accuracy better than 3%. EOS It is one of only five such massive eclipsing binaries known that also possess eccentric orbits and measured apsidal motions, thus making it an important benchmark for theoretical stellar evolution models. EOS However, recently reported determinations of the radii of V578 Mon differ significantly from previously reported values.	We reanalyze the published data for V578 Mon and trace the discrepancy to the use of an incorrect formulation for the stellar potentials in the most recent analysis.
doc	Phase transition in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime EOS Using a static massive spherically symmetric scalar field coupled to gravity in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) background, first we consider some asymptotic solutions near horizon and their local equations of state(E.O.S) on them. EOS We show that near cosmological and event horizons our scalar field behaves as a dust. EOS At the next step near two pure de-Sitter or Schwarzschild horizons we obtain a coupling dependent pressure to energy density ratio. EOS In the case of a minimally couplling this ratio is -1 which springs to the mind thermodynamical behavior of dark energy. EOS If having a negative pressure behavior near these horizons we concluded that the coupling constant must be _EQN_ >. EOS Therefore we derive a new constraint on the value of our coupling _EQN_.	These two different behaviors of unique matter in the distinct regions of spacetime at present era can be interpreted as a phase transition from dark matter to dark energy in the cosmic scales and construct a unified scenario.

doc	Hamilton-Jacobi Theory for Degenerate Lagrangian Systems with Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints EOS We extend Hamilton-Jacobi theory to Lagrange-Dirac (or implicit Lagrangian) systems, a generalized formulation of Lagrangian mechanics that can incorporate degenerate Lagrangians as well as holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. EOS We refer to the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation as the Dirac-Hamilton-Jacobi equation. EOS For non-degenerate Lagrangian systems with nonholonomic constraints, the theory specializes to the recently developed nonholonomic Hamilton-Jacobi theory. EOS We are particularly interested in applications to a certain class of degenerate nonholonomic Lagrangian systems with symmetries, which we refer to as weakly degenerate Chaplygin systems, that arise as simplified models of nonholonomic mechanical systems;	these systems are shown to reduce to non-degenerate almost Hamiltonian systems, i.e., generalized Hamiltonian systems defined with non-closed two-forms.

doc	Quotients of del Pezzo surfaces of degree 2 EOS Let _EQN_ be any field of characteristic zero, _EQN_ be a del Pezzo surface of degree~ _EQN_ and _EQN_ be a group acting on _EQN_. EOS In this paper we study _EQN_ -rationality questions for the quotient surface _EQN_. EOS If there are no smooth _EQN_ -points on _EQN_ then _EQN_ is obviously non- _EQN_ -rational. EOS Assume that the set of smooth _EQN_ -points on the quotient is not empty.	We find a list of groups, such that the quotient surface can be non- _EQN_ -rational.
doc	Gravitational waves from precessing engines in GRBs EOS In the framework of a transient accretion disk at the core of a gamma-ray burst we compute possible periods of Lense-Thirring precession. EOS Next, we evaluate the putative gravitational waves associated with such dynamical setup. EOS Assuming a characteristic time-profile for the gamma-ray emission of a disk-jet system, we obtain light-curves presenting a time microstructure similar to that reported in some GRB events. EOS After adjustment of the parameters out of two specific GRBs we evaluate the detectability of the gravitational waves produced by the precession of this accretion disk.	As a conclusion, our analysis shows that some GRBs are likely to be probed with Advanced LIGO.
doc	Greedy Selfish Network Creation EOS We introduce and analyze greedy equilibria (GE) for the well-known model of selfish network creation by Fabrikant et al[PODC'03]. EOS GE are interesting for two reasons: (1) they model outcomes found by agents which prefer smooth adaptations over radical strategy-changes, (2) GE are outcomes found by agents which do not have enough computational resources to play optimally. EOS In the model of Fabrikant et al agents correspond to Internet Service Providers which buy network links to improve their quality of network usage. EOS It is known that computing a best response in this model is NP-hard. EOS Hence, poly-time agents are likely not to play optimally. EOS But how good are networks created by such agents? EOS We answer this question for very simple agents. EOS Quite surprisingly, naive greedy play suffices to create remarkably stable networks. EOS Specifically, we show that in the SUM version, where agents attempt to minimize their average distance to all other agents, GE capture Nash equilibria (NE) on trees and that any GE is in 3-approximate NE on general networks. EOS For the latter we also provide a lower bound of 3/2 on the approximation ratio. EOS For the MAX version, where agents attempt to minimize their maximum distance, we show that any GE-star is in 2-approximate NE and any GE-tree having larger diameter is in 6/5-approximate NE.	Both bounds are tight.

doc	Quantitative Evaluation of the Effects of Positional versus Orientational Disorder on the Scattering of Acoustic Phonons in Disordered Matter EOS The phonon scattering processes on the three solid phases of ethanol are investigated by means of thermal conductivity, light and neutron scattering measurements as well as molecular dynamics simulations on single-crystalline models for the two crystalline modifications (fully ordered monooclinic and orientationally disordered bcc phases). EOS The orientationally disordered crystal is found to exhibit a temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity that is remarkably close to that found for the structurally amorphous solid, specially at low temperatures. EOS The results, together with measurements of the Brillouin linewidths as derived from light scattering measurements emphasize the role of orientational disorder on phonon scattering.	The experimental results obtained on polycrystal samples are then discussed with the aid of computer simulations on single-crystalline models of both bcc and monoclinic crystals.
doc	Quantum spin liquids in the absence of spin-rotation symmetry: application to Herbertsmithite EOS It has been suggested that the nearest-neighbour (NN) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg (HAF) model on the Kagome lattice may be a good starting point to understand the quantum spin-liquid (QSL) behaviour discovered in Herbertsmithite. EOS We investigate possible QSL phases in the presence of experimentally relevant spin-rotation symmetry-breaking perturbations such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Ising interactions, as well as second-neighbour antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions. EOS We use the projective symmetry group analysis within the slave-fermion framework of QSL phases and systematically classify possible QSLs in the presence of these perturbations. EOS The dynamical spin-structure factor for relevant QSLs is computed and their effects are studied. EOS Our calculations reveal dispersive features in the spin structure factor embedded in a generally diffuse background due to the existence of fractionalized S=1/2 excitations called spinons. EOS For two of the previously proposed _EQN_ states, the dispersive features are almost absent, and diffuse scattering dominates over a large energy window throughout the Brillouin zone. EOS This resembles the structure factor observed in recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments on singlet crystals of Herbertsmithite. EOS Furthermore, one of the _EQN_ states with the spin structure factor with mostly diffuse scattering is gapped, and it may be adiabatically connected to the gapped QSL state observed in recent DMRG calculations for the NN HAF.	The above perturbations are found to enhance the diffuse nature of the spin structure factor and reduce the momentum dependencies of the spin gap.
doc	A Formal Comparison of Approaches to Datatype-Generic Programming EOS Datatype-generic programming increases program abstraction and reuse by making functions operate uniformly across different types. EOS Many approaches to generic programming have been proposed over the years, most of them for Haskell, but recently also for dependently typed languages such as Agda. EOS Different approaches vary in expressiveness, ease of use, and implementation techniques. EOS Some work has been done in comparing the different approaches informally. EOS However, to our knowledge there have been no attempts to formally prove relations between different approaches. EOS We thus present a formal comparison of generic programming libraries. EOS We show how to formalise different approaches in Agda, including a coinductive representation, and then establish theorems that relate the approaches to each other.	We provide constructive proofs of inclusion of one approach in another that can be used to convert between approaches, helping to reduce code duplication across different libraries.
doc	Free path lengths in quasicrystals EOS Previous studies of kinetic transport in the Lorentz gas have been limited to cases where the scatterers are distributed at random (e.g. EOS at the points of a spatial Poisson process) or at the vertices of a Euclidean lattice. EOS In the present paper we investigate quasicrystalline scatterer configurations, which are non-periodic, yet strongly correlated. EOS A famous example is the vertex set of the Penrose tiling. EOS Our main result proves the existence of a limit distribution of the free path length, which answers a question of Wennberg.	The limit distribution is characterised by a certain random variable on the space of higher dimensional lattices, and is distinctly different from the exponential distribution observed for random scatterer configurations.
doc	The 2015 super-active state of recurrent nova T CrB and the long term evolution after the 1946 outburst EOS The recurrent nova T CrB has entered in 2015 a phase of unprecedented high activity. EOS To trace something equivalent, it is necessary to go back to 1938, before the last nova eruption in 1946. EOS The 2015 super-active state is characterized by: a large increase in the mean brightness (Delta B =0.72 mag over the uderlying secular trend), vanishing of the orbital modulation from the B-band lightcurve, and appearance of strong and high ionization emission lines, on top of a nebular continuum that overwhelms at optical wavelengths the absoption spectrum of the M giant. EOS Among the emission lines, HeII 4686 attains a flux in excess of Hgamma, the full set of OIII and NIII lines involved in the Bowen fluorescence mechanism are strong and varying in intensity in phase with HeII 4686, and OIV and [NeV] are present. EOS A large increase in the radiation output from the hot source is reponsible for a large expansion in the ionized fraction of the M giant wind. EOS The wind is completely ionized in the direction to the observer. EOS A high electron density is supported by the weakness of forbidden lines and by the large amplitude and short time scale of the reprocessing by the nebular material of the highly variable photo-ionization input from the hot source. EOS During the super-active state the nebula is varying to and from ionization-bounded and density-bounded conditions, and the augmented irradiation of the cool giant has changed the spectral type of its side facing the hot source from M3III to M2III, i.e.	an increase of ~80 K in effective temperature.
doc	Possible lightest _EQN_ Hypernucleus with Modern _EQN_ Interactions EOS Experimental evidence exists that the _EQN_ -nucleus interaction is attractive. EOS We search for _EQN_ and _EQN_ bound systems on the basis of the AV8 _EQN_ potential combined with either a phenomenological Nijmegen _EQN_ potential or a first principles HAL QCD _EQN_ potential. EOS The binding energies of the three-body and four-body systems (below the _EQN_ and _EQN_ / _EQN_ thresholds, respectively) are calculated by a high precision variational approach, the Gaussian Expansion Method.	Although the two _EQN_ potentials have significantly different isospin (_EQN_) and spin (_EQN_) dependence, the _EQN_ system with quantum numbers _EQN_) appears to be bound (one deep for Nijmegen and one shallow for HAL QCD) below the _EQN_ / _EQN_ threshold.

doc	Simulating rare events in dynamical processes EOS Atypical, rare trajectories of dynamical systems are important: they are often the paths for chemical reactions, the haven of (relative) stability of planetary systems, the rogue waves that are detected in oil platforms, the structures that are responsible for intermittency in a turbulent liquid, the active regions that allow a supercooled liquid to flow... EOS Simulating them in an efficient, accelerated way, is in fact quite simple. EOS In this paper we review a computational technique to study such rare events in both stochastic and Hamiltonian systems. EOS The method is based on the evolution of a family of copies of the system which are replicated or killed in such a way as to favor the realization of the atypical trajectories.	We illustrate this with various examples.
doc	Non-Convex Compressed Sensing Using Partial Support Information EOS In this paper we address the recovery conditions of weighted _EQN_ minimization for signal reconstruction from compressed sensing measurements when partial support information is available.

Moreover, the sufficient recovery conditions of weighted _EQN_ are weaker than those of regular _EQN_ minimization if at least _EQN_ of the support estimate is accurate.

EOS While some of these microorganisms are considered as essential regulators of our immune system, some others can cause several diseases such as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), diabetes, and cancer. EOS IBD, is a gut related disorder where the deviations from the healthy gut microbiome are considered to be associated with IBD.	Although existing studies attempt to unveal the composition of the gut microbiome in relation to IBD diseases, a comprehensive picture is far from being complete.
doc	The role of parametric instabilities in turbulence generation and proton heating: Hybrid simulations of parallel propagating Alfv\'en waves EOS Large amplitude Alfv\'en waves tend to be unstable to parametric instabilities which result in a decay process of the initial wave into different daughter waves depending upon the amplitude of the fluctuations and the plasma beta. EOS The propagation angle with respect to the mean magnetic field of the daughter waves plays an important role in determining the type of decay. EOS In this paper, we revisit this problem by means of multi-dimensional hybrid simulations. EOS In particular, we study the decay and the subsequent nonlinear evolution of large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves by investigating the saturation mechanism of the instability and its final nonlinear state reached for different wave amplitudes and plasma beta conditions. EOS As opposed to one-dimensional simulations where the Decay instability is suppressed for increasing plasma beta values, we find that the decay process in multi-dimensions persists at large values of the plasma beta via the filamentation/magnetosonic decay instabilities. EOS In general, the decay process acts as a trigger both to develop a perpendicular turbulent cascade and to enhance mean field-aligned wave-particle interactions.	We find indeed that the saturated state is characterized by a turbulent plasma displaying a field-aligned beam at the Alfv\'en speed and increased temperatures that we ascribe to the Landau resonance and pitch angle scattering in phase space.
doc	Towards Hate Speech Detection at Large via Deep Generative Modeling EOS Hate speech detection is a critical problem in social media platforms, being often accused for enabling the spread of hatred and igniting physical violence. EOS Hate speech detection requires overwhelming resources including high-performance computing for online posts and tweets monitoring as well as thousands of human experts for daily screening of suspected posts or tweets. EOS Recently, Deep Learning (DL)-based solutions have been proposed for automatic detection of hate speech, using modest-sized training datasets of few thousands of hate speech sequences. EOS While these methods perform well on the specific datasets, their ability to detect new hate speech sequences is limited and has not been investigated.	Being a data-driven approach, it is well known that DL surpasses other methods whenever a scale-up in train dataset size and diversity is achieved.

EOS Unfortunately, up to this point, these frames have proven notoriously difficult to construct. EOS Indeed, though the set of all unit norm tight frames, modulo rotations, is known to contain manifolds of nontrivial dimension, we have but a small finite number of known constructions of such frames. EOS In this paper, we present a new iterative algorithm---gradient descent of the frame potential---for increasing the degree of tightness of any finite unit norm frame. EOS The algorithm itself is trivial to implement, and it preserves certain group structures present in the initial frame. EOS In the special case where the number of frame elements is relatively prime to the dimension of the underlying space, we show that this algorithm converges to a unit norm tight frame at a linear rate, provided the initial unit norm frame is already sufficiently close to being tight. EOS By slightly modifying this approach, we get a similar, but weaker, result in the non-relatively-prime case, providing an explicit answer to the Paulsen problem: "How close is a frame which is almost tight and almost unit norm to some unit norm tight frame?

The metallicity in the disk is not uniform, and it usually decreases with the distance to the galaxy center, in the so-called radial metallicity gradient.

EOS HERAPDF at NNLO fits are presented as well, resulting, however, in a worse description of the combined HERA data.	In addition, a preliminary analysis including the HERA II measurements of lower proton-beam energies is performed.

doc	Three years of Ulysses dust data: 2005 to 2007 EOS The Ulysses spacecraft has been orbiting the Sun on a highly inclined ellipse since it encountered Jupiter in February 1992. EOS Since then it made almost three revolutions about the Sun. EOS Here we report on the final three years of data taken by the on-board dust detector.	During this time, the dust detector recorded 609 dust impacts of particles with masses 10^-16 g <= m <= 10^-7 g, bringing the mission total to 6719 dust data sets.

doc	Polar confinement of the Sun's interior magnetic field by laminar magnetostrophic flow EOS The global-scale interior magnetic field needed to account for the Sun's observed differential rotation can be effective only if confined below the convection zone in all latitudes, including the polar caps. EOS Axisymmetric nonlinear MHD solutions are obtained showing that such confinement can be brought about by a very weak downwelling flow U~10^ -5 cm/s over each pole. EOS Such downwelling is consistent with the helioseismic evidence. EOS All three components of the magnetic field decay exponentially with altitude across a thin "magnetic confinement layer" located at the bottom of the tachocline. EOS With realistic parameter values, the thickness of the confinement layer ~10^ -3 of the Sun's radius. EOS Alongside baroclinic effects and stable thermal stratification, the solutions take into account the stable compositional stratification of the helium settling layer, if present as in today's Sun, and the small diffusivity of helium through hydrogen, chi. EOS The small value of chi relative to magnetic diffusivity produces a double boundary-layer structure in which a "helium sublayer" of smaller vertical scale is sandwiched between the top of the helium settling layer and the rest of the confinement layer. EOS Solutions are obtained using both semi-analytical and purely numerical, finite-difference techniques. EOS The confinement-layer flows are magnetostrophic to excellent approximation.	More precisely, the principal force balances are between Lorentz, Coriolis, pressure-gradient and buoyancy forces, with relative accelerations and viscous forces negligible.
doc	A theory of tensor products for module categories for a vertex operator algebra, III EOS This is the third part in a series of papers developing a tensor product theory for modules for a vertex operator algebra. EOS The goal of this theory is to construct a ``vertex tensor category'' structure on the category of modules for a suitable vertex operator algebra. EOS The notion of vertex tensor category is essentially a ``complex analogue'' of the notion of symmetric tensor category, and in fact a vertex tensor category produces a braided tensor category in a natural way. EOS In this paper, we focus on a particular element _EQN_ of a certain moduli space of three-punctured Riemann spheres; EOS in general, every element of this moduli space will give rise to a notion of tensor product, and one must consider all these notions in order to construct a vertex tensor category.	Here we present the fundamental properties of the _EQN_ -tensor product of two modules for a vertex operator algebra.
doc	The Confrontation between General Relativity and Experiment EOS The status of experimental tests of general relativity and of theoretical frameworks for analysing them is reviewed. EOS Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP) is well supported by experiments such as the Eotvos experiment, tests of special relativity, and the gravitational redshift experiment.	Future tests of EEP and of the inverse square law are searching for new interactions arising from unification or quantum gravity.
doc	Two dimensional ice mapping of molecular cores EOS We present maps of the column densities of H _EQN_ O, CO _EQN_, and CO ices towards the molecular cores B~35A, DC~274.2-00.4, BHR~59, and DC~300.7-01.0. EOS These ice maps, probing spatial distances in molecular cores as low as 2200~AU, challenge the traditional hypothesis that the denser the region observed, the more ice is present, providing evidence that the relationships between solid molecular species are more varied than the generic picture we often adopt to model gas-grain chemical processes and explain feedback between solid phase processes and gas phase abundances.	We present the first combined solid-gas maps of a single molecular species, based upon observations of both CO ice and gas phase C _EQN_ O towards B~35A, a star-forming dense core in Orion.
doc	Dumb-bell-shaped equilibrium figures for fiducial contact-binary asteroids and EKBOs EOS In this work, we investigate the equilibrium figures of a dumb-bell-shaped sequence with which we are still not well acquainted. EOS Studies have shown that these elongated and nonconvex figures may realistically replace the classic "Roche binary approximation" for modeling putative peanut-shaped or contact binary asteroids. EOS The best-fit dumb-bell shapes, combined with the known rotational period of the objects, provide estimates of the bulk density of these objects.	This new class of mathematical figures has been successfully tested on the observed light curves of three noteworthy small bodies: main-belt asteroid 216 Kleopatra, Trojan asteroid 624 Hektor and Edgeworth-Kuiper-belt object 2001 QG298.
doc	Enabling near real-time remote search for fast transient events with lossy data compression EOS We present a systematic evaluation of JPEG2000 (ISO/IEC 15444) as a transport data format to enable rapid remote searches for fast transient events as part of the Deeper Wider Faster program (DWF). EOS DWF uses ~20 telescopes from radio to gamma-rays to perform simultaneous and rapid-response follow-up searches for fast transient events on millisecond-to-hours timescales. EOS DWF search demands have a set of constraints that is becoming common amongst large collaborations. EOS Here, we focus on the rapid optical data component of DWF led by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at CTIO.	Each DECam image has 70 total CCDs saved as a ~1.2 gigabyte FITS file.
doc	The phase diagram of quantum gravity from diffeomorphism-invariant RG-flows EOS We evaluate the phase diagram of quantum gravity within a fully diffeomorphism-invariant renormalisation group approach. EOS The construction is based on the geometrical or Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action. EOS We also resolve the difference between the fluctuation metric and the background metric. EOS This allows for fully background-independent flows in gravity. EOS The results provide further evidence for the ultraviolet fixed point scenario in quantum gravity with quantitative changes for the fixed point physics. EOS We also find a stable infrared fixed point related to classical Einstein gravity.	Implications and possible extensions are discussed.
doc	Commutative algebraic groups up to isogeny. II EOS This paper develops a representation-theoretic approach to the isogeny category _EQN_ of commutative group schemes of finite type over a field _EQN_, studied in arXiv:1602:00222. EOS We construct a ring _EQN_ such that _EQN_ is equivalent to the category _EQN_ -mod of all left _EQN_ -modules of finite length. EOS We also construct an abelian category of _EQN_ -modules, _EQN_ - _EQN_, which is hereditary, has enough projectives, and contains _EQN_ -mod as a Serre subcategory; EOS this yields a more conceptual proof of the main result of [loc.	cit.], asserting that _EQN_ is hereditary.
doc	A communication-efficient nonlocal measurement with application to communication complexity and bipartite gate capacities EOS Two dual questions in quantum information theory are to determine the communication cost of simulating a bipartite unitary gate, and to determine their communication capacities. EOS We present a bipartite unitary gate with two surprising properties: 1) simulating it with the assistance of unlimited EPR pairs requires far more communication than with a better choice of entangled state, and 2) its communication capacity is far lower than its capacity to create entanglement. EOS This suggests that 1) unlimited EPR pairs are not the most general model of entanglement assistance for two-party communication tasks, and 2) the entangling and communicating abilities of a unitary interaction can vary nearly independently.	The technical contribution behind these results is a communication-efficient protocol for measuring whether an unknown shared state lies in a specified rank-one subspace or its orthogonal complement.
doc	Bilinear Random Projections for Locality-Sensitive Binary Codes EOS Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is a popular data-independent indexing method for approximate similarity search, where random projections followed by quantization hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each other than for those that are far apart. EOS Most of high-dimensional visual descriptors for images exhibit a natural matrix structure.	When visual descriptors are represented by high-dimensional feature vectors and long binary codes are assigned, a random projection matrix requires expensive complexities in both space and time.

doc	On the characteristic form of histograms appearing at the culmination of solar eclipse EOS As shown in a number of our works, the form of histograms - distributions of amplitude fluctuations - varies regularly in time, with these variations being similar for processes of any nature, from biochemical reactions to noise in the gravitational antenna and all types of the radioactive decay. EOS In particular, we have revealed basic laws, suggesting a cosmo-physical nature of these phenomena, in the time series created by the noise generators of the global GCP net. EOS On the basis of all the results obtained, a conclusion has been made that the histogram form is determined by fluctuations of the spacetime, which depend on the movement of the measured system (laboratory) relative to the heavenly bodies. EOS An important step to understand the nature of these phenomena was the finding that at the moments of the new Moon, a specific histogram form appears practically simultaneously at different geographical points, from Arctic to Antarctic, in middle latitudes of West and East hemispheres. EOS This effect seems to be not due to a change of the tide-generating forces; EOS to explain it, nontrivial hypotheses are needed.	The present paper shows the appearance of specific histogram forms at the culminations of the solar eclipses (moments of the geocentric superposition of the Sun and the Moon), with the eclipse forms differing from the new-moon ones.
doc	Driving Solar Giant Cells through the Self-Organization of Near-Surface Plumes EOS Global 3D simulations of solar giant-cell convection have provided significant insight into the processes which yield the Sun's observed differential rotation and cyclic dynamo action. EOS However, as we move to higher resolution simulations a variety of codes have encountered what has been termed the convection conundrum. EOS As these simulations increase in resolution and hence the level of turbulence achieved, they tend to produce weak or even anti-solar differential rotation patterns associated with a weak rotational influence (high Rossby number) due to large convective velocities. EOS One potential culprit for this convection conundrum is the upper boundary condition applied in most simulations which is generally impenetrable. EOS Here we present an alternative stochastic plume boundary condition which imposes small-scale convective plumes designed to mimic near-surface convective downflows, thus allowing convection to carry the majority of the outward solar energy flux up to and through our simulated upper boundary.	The use of a plume boundary condition leads to significant changes in the convective driving realized in the simulated domain and thus to the convective energy transport, the dominant scale of the convective enthalpy flux, and the relative strength of the strongest downflows, the downflow network, and the convective upflows.
doc	On Distributed Routing in Underwater Optical Wireless Sensor Networks EOS Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) is becoming an attractive technology for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) since it offers high-speed communication links. EOS Although UOWC overcomes the drawbacks of acoustic and radio frequency communication channels such as high latency and low data rate, yet, it has its own limitations. EOS One of the major limitations of UOWC is its limited transmission range which demands to develop a multi-hop network with efficient routing protocols. EOS Currently, the routing protocols for UOWSNs are centralized having high complexity and large end-to-end delay. EOS In this article, first, we present the existing routing protocols for UOWSNs. EOS Based on the existing protocols, we then propose distributed routing protocols to address the problems of high complexity and large end-to-end delay.	Numerical results have been provided to show that the proposed routing protocol is superior to the existing protocols in terms of complexity and end-to-end delay.
doc	Deuteration in infrared dark clouds EOS Much of the dense gas in molecular clouds has a filamentary structure but the detailed structure and evolution of this gas is poorly known. EOS We have observed 54 cores in infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) using N _EQN_ H _EQN_ (1-0) and (3-2) to determine the kinematics of the densest material, where stars will form. EOS We also observed N _EQN_ D _EQN_ (3-2) towards 29 of the brightest peaks to analyse the level of deuteration which is an excellent probe of the quiescent of the early stages of star formation. EOS There were 13 detections of N _EQN_ D _EQN_ (3-2). EOS This is one of the largest samples of IRDCs yet observed in these species. EOS The deuteration ratio in these sources ranges between 0.003 and 0.14. EOS For most of the sources the material traced by N _EQN_ D _EQN_ and N _EQN_ H _EQN_ (3-2) still has significant turbulent motions, however three objects show subthermal N _EQN_ D _EQN_ velocity dispersion.	Surprisingly the presence or absence of an embedded 70 _EQN_ m source shows no correlation with the detection of N _EQN_ D _EQN_ (3-2), nor does it correlate with any change in velocity dispersion or excitation temperature.
doc	A Comprehensive Spectral Analysis of the X-Ray Pulsar 4U 1907+09 from Two Observations with the Suzaku X-Ray Observatory EOS We present results from two observations of the wind-accreting X-ray pulsar 4U 1907+09 using the Suzaku observatory. EOS The broadband time-averaged spectrum allows us to examine the continuum emission of the source and the cyclotron resonance scattering feature at ~19 keV. EOS Additionally, using the narrow CCD response of Suzaku near 6 keV allows us to study in detail the Fe K bandpass and to quantify the Fe K beta line for this source for the first time. EOS The source is absorbed by fully-covering material along the line of sight with a column density of NH ~2e22 /cm^2, consistent with a wind accreting geometry, and a high Fe abundance (~3-4 x solar). EOS Time and phase-resolved analyses allow us to study variations in the source spectrum.	In particular, dips found in the 2006 observation which are consistent with earlier observations occur in the hard X-ray bandpass, implying a variation of the whole continuum rather than occultation by intervening material, while a dip near the end of the 2007 observation occurs mainly in the lower energies implying an increase in NH along the line of sight, perhaps indicating clumpiness in the stellar wind.
doc	The impact of species-neutral stage structure on macroecological patterns EOS Despite its radical assumption of ecological equivalence between species, neutral biodiversity theory can often provide good fits to species abundance distributions observed in nature. EOS Major criticisms of neutral theory have focused on interspecific differences, which are in conflict with ecological equivalence.	However, neutrality in nature is also broken by differences between conspecific individuals at different life stages, which in many communities may vastly exceed interspecific differences between individuals at similar stages.
doc	What an Agile Leader Does: The Group Dynamics Perspective EOS When large industrial organizations change to(or start with) an agile approach to operations, managers and some employees are supposed to be "agile leaders" often without being given a clear definition of what that comprises when building agile teams.

doc	A Semiclassical, Entropic Proof of a Weak Gravity Conjecture EOS We present a semiclassical proof of the weak gravity conjecture in _EQN_ spacetime dimensions for scalar matter gauged under a _EQN_ gauge group. EOS We compute the non-perturbative macroscopic entropy of a scalar field in an extremal black hole background at the level of linearized backreaction on the metric. EOS The scalar field is assumed to violate or saturate the weak gravity conjecture.	The scalar contributes a logarithmic correction to the entropy in the black hole geometry that outgrows the classical contribution.
doc	Presenting generalized q-Schur algebras EOS We obtain a presentation by generators and relations for generalized Schur algebras and their quantizations. EOS This extends earlier results obtained in the type A case. EOS The presentation is compatible with Lusztig's modified form of a quantized enveloping algebra.	We show that generalized Schur algebras inherit a canonical basis from the modified form of the quantized enveloping algebra, that this gives them a cellular structure, and thus they are quasihereditary over a field.
doc	Galactic planetary science EOS Planetary science beyond the boundaries of our Solar System is today in its infancy. EOS Until a couple of decades ago, the detailed investigation of the planetary properties was restricted to objects orbiting inside the Kuiper Belt. EOS Today, we cannot ignore that the number of known planets has increased by two orders of magnitude nor that these planets resemble anything but the objects present in our own Solar System. EOS Whether this fact is the result of a selection bias induced by the kind of techniques used to discover new planets -mainly radial velocity and transit - or simply the proof that the Solar System is a rarity in the Milky Way, we do not know yet. EOS What is clear, though, is that the Solar System has failed to be the paradigm not only in our Galaxy but even 'just' in the solar neighbourhood.	This finding, although unsettling, forces us to reconsider our knowledge of planets under a different light and perhaps question a few of the theoretical pillars on which we base our current 'understanding'.
doc	Performances of multi-gap timing RPCs for relativistic ions in the range Z=1-6 EOS We present the performance of Multi-gap timing RPCs under irradiation by fully stripped relativistic ions (gamma*beta=2.7, Z=1-6). EOS A time resolution of 80 ps at high efficiency has been obtained by just using standard `off the shelf' 4-gap timing RPCs from the new HADES ToF wall. EOS The resolution worsened to 100 ps for ~ 1 kHz/cm2 proton flux and for ~ 100 Hz/cm2 Carbon flux. EOS The chambers were operated at a standard field of E=100 kV/cm and showed a high stability during the experiment, supporting the fact that RPCs are a convenient choice when accommodating a very broad range of ionizing particles is needed.	The data provides insight in the region of very highly ionizing particles (up to x 36 mips) and can be used to constrain the existing avalanche and Space-Charge models far from the usual `mip valley'.

doc	Studying the metallicity gradient in Virgo Ellipticals with E-ELT photometry of resolved stars EOS The next generation of large aperture ground based telescopes will offer the opportunity to perform accurate stellar photometry in very crowded fields. EOS This future capability will allow one to study in detail the stellar population in distant galaxies. EOS In this paper we explore the effect of photometric errors on the stellar metallicity distribution derived from the color distribution of the Red Giant Branch stars in the central regions of galaxies at the distance of the Virgo cluster. EOS We focus on the analysis of the Color-Magnitude Diagrams at different radii in a typical giant Elliptical galaxy obtained from synthetic data constructed to exemplify observations of the European Extremely Large Telescope. EOS The simulations adopt the specifications of the first light high resolution imager MICADO and the expected performance of the Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics Module MAORY. EOS We find that the foreseen photometric accuracy allows us to recover the shape of the metallicity distribution with a resolution _EQN_ dex in the inner regions (_EQN_ = 20.5 mag arcsec _EQN_) and _EQN_ dex in regions with _EQN_ = 21.6 mag arcsec _EQN_, that corresponds to approximately half of the effective radius for a typical giant elliptical in Virgo.	At the effective radius (_EQN_ mag arcsec _EQN_), the metallicity distribution is recovered with a resolution of _EQN_ dex.
doc	Desingularization of singular hyperkaehler varieties II EOS This is a second part of alg-geom/9611015. EOS We construct a natural hyperkaehler desingularization for all singular hyperkaehler varieties. EOS The desingularization theorem was proven in alg-geom/9611015 under additional assumption of local homogeneity.	Here we show that local homogeneity is redundant: every singular hyperkaehler variety has locally homogeneous singularities.
doc	Bra-ket wormholes in gravitationally prepared states EOS We consider two dimensional CFT states that are produced by a gravitational path integral. EOS As a first case, we consider a state produced by Euclidean _EQN_ evolution followed by flat space evolution. EOS We use the fine grained entropy formula to explore the nature of the state. EOS We find that the naive hyperbolic space geometry leads to a paradox.	This is solved if we include a geometry that connects the bra with the ket, a bra-ket wormhole.
doc	Efficient generation of realistic model systems of amorphous silica EOS We used classical molecular dynamics and the van Beest Kramer van Santen (BKS) potential to generate small model systems of amorphous silica. EOS We further optimized the classically equilibrated configurations using plane wave based density functional theory and a generalized gradient (GGA) approximation. EOS Within ab initio treatment we showed that both geometry optimization and Car-Parrinello annealing lead to the same final configurations but the CPU time required for the geometry optimization to reach convergence is one fifth of the time needed by a Car-Parrinello annealing.	In addition during the optimization or the annealing no substantial change occurs on the topology acquired by the vitreous silica at the end of the classical quenching protocol.
doc	On the magnetism and dynamics of prominence legs hosting tornadoes EOS Solar tornadoes are dark vertical filamentary structures observed in the extreme ultraviolet associated with prominence legs and filament barbs. EOS Their true nature and relationship to prominences requires understanding their magnetic structure and dynamic properties. EOS Recently, a controversy has arisen: is the magnetic field organized forming vertical, helical structures or is it dominantly horizontal? EOS And concerning their dynamics, are tornadoes really rotating or is it just a visual illusion? EOS Here, we analyze four consecutive spectropolarimetric scans of a prominence hosting tornadoes on its legs which help us shed some light on their magnetic and dynamical properties.	We show that the magnetic field is very smooth in all the prominence, probably an intrinsic property of the coronal field.
doc	Attributes Coupling based Item Enhanced Matrix Factorization Technique for Recommender Systems EOS Recommender system has attracted lots of attentions since it helps users alleviate the information overload problem. EOS Matrix factorization technique is one of the most widely employed collaborative filtering techniques in the research of recommender systems due to its effectiveness and efficiency in dealing with very large user-item rating matrices. EOS Recently, based on the intuition that additional information provides useful insights for matrix factorization techniques, several recommendation algorithms have utilized additional information to improve the performance of matrix factorization methods. EOS However, the majority focus on dealing with the cold start user problem and ignore the cold start item problem. EOS In addition, there are few suitable similarity measures for these content enhanced matrix factorization approaches to compute the similarity between categorical items. EOS In this paper, we propose attributes coupling based item enhanced matrix factorization method by incorporating item attribute information into matrix factorization technique as well as adapting the coupled object similarity to capture the relationship between items. EOS Item attribute information is formed as an item relationship regularization term to regularize the process of matrix factorization.	Specifically, the similarity between items is measured by the Coupled Object Similarity considering coupling between items.

EOS Our method applies to models with local interactions and accounts for both short-range correlations and long-range order.	Short-range correlations are accurately taken into account via exact diagonalization of finite clusters.

EOS The retweets of each original tweet are modelled by a NHPP, for which the intensity function is a product of time-decaying components and another component that depends on the follower count of the original tweet author.	The latter allows us to explain or predict the ultimate retweet count by a network centrality-related covariate.
doc	Engineering bilinear mode coupling in circuit QED: Theory and experiment EOS Photonic states of superconducting microwave cavities controlled by transmon ancillas provide a platform for encoding and manipulating quantum information. EOS A key challenge in scaling up the platform is the requirement to communicate on demand the information between the cavities.

The H _EQN_ column density at the AT2018cow site is estimated to be _EQN_ cm _EQN_.
doc	A Tutorial on Deep Learning for Music Information Retrieval EOS Following their success in Computer Vision and other areas, deep learning techniques have recently become widely adopted in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) research. EOS However, the majority of works aim to adopt and assess methods that have been shown to be effective in other domains, while there is still a great need for more original research focusing on music primarily and utilising musical knowledge and insight. EOS The goal of this paper is to boost the interest of beginners by providing a comprehensive tutorial and reducing the barriers to entry into deep learning for MIR. EOS We lay out the basic principles and review prominent works in this hard to navigate the field. EOS We then outline the network structures that have been successful in MIR problems and facilitate the selection of building blocks for the problems at hand.	Finally, guidelines for new tasks and some advanced topics in deep learning are discussed to stimulate new research in this fascinating field.

EOS The rainbow, for example, is a ray catastrophe where light rays become infinitely intense.

EOS Black holes cause wave singularities.	Waves oscillate with infinitely small wave lengths at the event horizon where time stands still.
doc	Projected Euler method for stochastic delay differential equation under a global monotonicity condition EOS This paper investigates projected Euler-Maruyama method for stochastic delay differential equations under a global monotonicity condition. EOS This condition admits some equations with highly nonlinear drift and diffusion coefficients. EOS We appropriately generalized the idea of C-stability and B-consistency given by Beyn et al [J.

doc	Joint estimation of parameters in Ising model EOS We study joint estimation of the inverse temperature and magnetization parameters _EQN_ of an Ising model with a non-negative coupling matrix _EQN_ of size _EQN_, given one sample from the Ising model. EOS We give a general bound on the rate of consistency of the bi-variate pseudolikelihood estimator. EOS Using this, we show that estimation at rate _EQN_ is always possible if _EQN_ is the adjacency matrix of a bounded degree graph. EOS If _EQN_ is the scaled adjacency matrix of a graph whose average degree goes to _EQN_, the situation is a bit more delicate. EOS In this case estimation at rate _EQN_ is still possible if the graph is not regular (in an asymptotic sense).	Finally, we show that consistent estimation of both parameters is impossible if the graph is Erd\"os-Renyi with parameter _EQN_ free of _EQN_, thus confirming that estimation is harder on approximately regular graphs with large degree.

EOS We obtain an exact expression for the probability of non-perturbative gluon pair production per unit time per unit volume and per unit transverse momentum _EQN_ from arbitrary _EQN_.	We show that the tadpole (or single gluon) effective action does not contribute to the non-perturbative gluon pair production rate _EQN_.
doc	Discovery of a z = 7.452 High Equivalent Width Lyman- \alpha Emitter from the Hubble Space Telescope Faint Infrared Grism Survey EOS We present the results of an unbiased search for Ly \alpha emission from continuum-selected 6 < z < 8 galaxies. EOS Our dataset consists of 160 orbits of G102 slitless grism spectroscopy obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 as part of the Faint Infrared Grism Survey (FIGS; EOS PI: Malhotra), which obtains deep slitless spectra of all sources in four fields, and was designed to minimize contamination in observations of previously-identified high-redshift galaxy candidates. EOS The FIGS data can potentially spectroscopically confirm the redshifts of galaxies, and as Ly \alpha emission is resonantly scattered by neutral gas, FIGS can also constrain the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization. EOS These data have sufficient depth to detect Ly \alpha emission in this epoch, as Tilvi et al (2016) have published the FIGS detection of previously known (Finkelstein et al 2013) Ly \alpha emission at z = 7.51.	The FIGS data use five separate roll-angles of HST to mitigate the contamination by nearby galaxies.
doc	Maser Flare Simulations from Oblate and Prolate Clouds EOS We investigated, through numerical models, the flaring variability that may arise from the rotation of maser clouds of approximately spheroidal geometry, ranging from strongly oblate to strongly prolate examples. EOS Inversion solutions were obtained for each of these examples over a range of saturation levels from unsaturated to highly saturated.	Formal solutions were computed for rotating clouds with many randomly chosen rotation axes, and corresponding averaged maser light curves plotted with statistical information.
doc	Cuprates, Manganites, and Cobaltites: Multielectron Approach to the Band Structure EOS High- _EQN_ superconductors with CuO _EQN_ layers, manganites La _EQN_ Sr _EQN_ MnO _EQN_, and cobaltites LaCoO _EQN_ present several mysteries in their physical properties. EOS Most of them are believed to come from the strongly-correlated nature of these materials.	From the theoretical viewpoint, there are many hidden rocks in making the consistent description of the band structure and low-energy physics starting from the Fermi-liquid approach.
doc	A Hiking Trip Through the Orders of Magnitude: Deriving Efficient Generators for Closed Simply-Typed Lambda Terms and Normal Forms EOS Contrary to several other families of lambda terms, no closed formula or generating function is known and none of the sophisticated techniques devised in analytic combinatorics can currently help with counting or generating the set of simply-typed closed lambda terms of a given size. EOS Moreover, their asymptotic scarcity among the set of closed lambda terms makes counting them via brute force generation and type inference quickly intractable, with previous published work showing counts for them only up to size 10. EOS By taking advantage of the synergy between logic variables, unification with occurs check and efficient backtracking in today's Prolog systems, we climb 4 orders of magnitude above previously known counts by deriving progressively faster Horn Clause programs that generate and/or count the set of closed simply-typed lambda terms of sizes up to 14.	A similar count for closed simply-typed normal forms is also derived up to size 14.
doc	Theory of Protostellar Accretion EOS This paper reviews current theoretical work on the various stages of accretion in protostars, and the relationship of these ideal stages to the spectral classes of observed protostellar systems. EOS I discuss scaling relationships that have been obtained for models of pre-stellar cores as they evolve by ambipolar diffusion toward a central singularity, and expectations for the dynamical evolution as the cores collapse radially to form a rotating disk. EOS I summarize work that suggests accretion in T Tauri systems may be limited by ionization to disk surface layers, and implications for the variation of the disk accretion rate with radius.	Finally, I describe models for the asymptotic structure of free magnetocentrifugal winds, and show that the constant-density surfaces in these winds may be strongly collimated even when the streamlines are not.
doc	A note on critical Hawkes processes EOS Let _EQN_ be a distribution function on _EQN_ with _EQN_ and density _EQN_. EOS Let _EQN_ be the distribution function of _EQN_, _EQN_. EOS We show that for a critical Hawkes process with displacement density (= `excitement function' = `decay kernel') _EQN_, the random walk induced by _EQN_ is necessarily transient. EOS Our conjecture is that this condition is also sufficient for existence of a critical Hawkes process. EOS Our train of thought relies on the interpretation of critical Hawkes processes as cluster-invariant point processes. EOS From this property, we identify the law of critical Hawkes processes as a limit of independent cluster operations.	We establish uniqueness, stationarity, and infinite divisibility.
doc	Effect of polymeric additives on ignition, combustion and flame characteristics and soot deposits of crude oil droplets EOS Many oil fires have resulted from the crude oil train derailments in recent years. EOS Given the importance of crude oil shipping by rail to the energy security of the US, it is important to consider various methods that will decrease the likelihood of crude oil catching fire in case of a crude oil derailment. EOS Present study examines the effect of polybutadiene polymer on the combustion properties and soot deposits of Bakken and Pennsylvania crudes. EOS Treating these crudes as multicomponent liquid fuels and polybutadiene as an additive, droplet combustion experiments were conducted with sub-millimeter sized spherical droplets suspended on very fine support fibers. EOS Polybutadiene polymer additive of two different chain lengths has been investigated. EOS Results show that both polymer chain length and origin of crude oil have a significant effect on various combustion properties like combustion rate, ignition delay, total combustion time, and flame stand-off ratio.	Polymeric additives also change the soot deposit structure and particle size compared to the base fuel.
doc	Nested Bethe ansatz for `all' open spin chains with diagonal boundary conditions EOS We present in an unified and detailed way the nested Bethe ansatz for open spin chains based on Y(gl(\fn)), Y(gl(\fm|\fn)), U_ q (gl(\fn)) or U_ q (gl(\fm|\fn)) (super)algebras, with arbitrary representations (i.e. EOS `spins') on each site of the chain and diagonal boundary matrices (K^+(u),K^-(u)). EOS The nested Bethe anstaz applies for a general K^-(u), but a particular form of the K^+(u) matrix.	The construction extends and unifies the results already obtained for open spin chains based on fundamental representation and for some particular super-spin chains.
doc	Type IIB Orientifolds with NS-NS Antisymmetric Tensor Backgrounds EOS We consider six dimensional N=1 space-time supersymmetric Type IIB orientifolds with non-zero untwisted NS-NS sector B-field. EOS The B-field is quantized due to the requirement that the Type IIB spectrum be left-right symmetric. EOS The presence of the B-field results in rank reduction of both 99 and 55 open string sector gauge groups. EOS We point out that in some of the models with non-zero B-field there are extra tensor multiplets in the Z_2 twisted closed string sector, and we explain their origin in a simple example. EOS Also, the 59 open string sector states come with a multiplicity that depends on the B-field.	These two facts are in accord with anomaly cancellation requirements.
doc	Glassy Dynamics from Quark Confinement: Atomic Quantum Simulation of Gauge-Higgs Model on Lattice EOS In the previous works, we proposed atomic quantum simulations of the U(1) gauge-Higgs model by ultra-cold Bose gases. EOS By studying extended Bose-Hubbard models (EBHMs) including long-range repulsions, we clarified the locations of the confinement, Coulomb and Higgs phases. EOS In this paper, we study the EBHM with nearest-neighbor repulsions in one and two dimensions at large fillings by the Gutzwiller variational method. EOS We obtain phase diagrams and investigate dynamical behavior of electric flux from the gauge-theoretical point of view. EOS We also study if the system exhibits glassy quantum dynamics in the absence and presence of quenched disorder.	We explain that the obtained results have a natural interpretation in the gauge theory framework.
doc	Numerical solutions of some hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations with mixed derivatives including sine-Gordon equation EOS We consider linear and nonlinear hyperbolic SPDEs with mixed derivatives with additive space-time Gaussian white noise of the form _EQN_ Such equations, which transform to linear and nonlinear wave equations, including Klein-Gordon, Liouville's and the sine-Gordon equation, are related to what Zimmerman (1972) called a diffusion equation. EOS An explicit numerical scheme is employed in both deterministic and stochastic examples. EOS The scheme is checked for accuracy against known exact analytical solutions for deterministic equations.	In the stochastic case with _EQN_, solutions yield sample paths for the Brownian sheet whose statistics match well exact values.
doc	Compact Graphene Plasmonic Slot Photodetector on Silicon-on-insulator with High Responsivity EOS Graphene has extraordinary electro-optic properties and is therefore a promising candidate for monolithic photonic devices such as photodetectors. EOS However, the integration of this atom-thin layer material with bulky photonic components usually results in a weak light-graphene interaction leading to large device lengths limiting electro-optic performance. EOS In contrast, here we demonstrate a plasmonic slot graphene photodetector on silicon-on-insulator platform with high-responsivity given the 5 um-short device length.	We observe that the maximum photocurrent, and hence the highest responsivity, scales inversely with the slot gap width.

doc	Environment-assisted quantum transport in a 10-qubit network EOS The way in which energy is transported through an interacting system governs fundamental properties in many areas of physics, chemistry, and biology. EOS Remarkably, environmental noise can enhance the transport, an effect known as environment-assisted quantum transport (ENAQT). EOS In this paper, we study ENAQT in a network of coupled spins subject to engineered static disorder and temporally varying dephasing noise. EOS The interacting spin network is realized in a chain of trapped atomic ions and energy transport is represented by the transfer of electronic excitation between ions. EOS With increasing noise strength, we observe a crossover from coherent dynamics and Anderson localization to ENAQT and finally a suppression of transport due to the quantum Zeno effect.	We found that in the regime where ENAQT is most effective the transport is mainly diffusive, displaying coherences only at very short times.
doc	Simultaneous input & state estimation, singular filtering and stability EOS Input estimation is a signal processing technique associated with deconvolution of measured signals after filtering through a known dynamic system. EOS Kitanidis and others extended this to the simultaneous estimation of the input signal and the state of the intervening system.	This is normally posed as a special least-squares estimation problem with unbiasedness.
doc	muSR investigation of magnetism and magnetoelectric coupling in Cu2OSeO3 EOS A detailed zero and transverse field (ZF&TF) muon spin rotation (muSR) investigation of magnetism and the magneto-electric coupling in Cu2OSeO3 is reported. EOS An internal magnetic field B_int(T=0) = 85.37(25) mT was found, in agreement with a ferrimagnetic state below Tc = 57.0(1) K. EOS The temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter is well described by the relation B_int = B(0)(1-(T/Tc)^2)^b with an effective exponent b = 0.39(1) which is close to the critical exponent B ~ 1/3 for a three dimensional (3D) magnetic system.	Just above Tc the muon relaxation rate follows the power low \lambda (T)\propto (T/Tc - 1)^\omega with \omega = 1.06(9), which is characteristic for 3D ferromagnets.
doc	The Method of Archimedes in the geometry of quadrics EOS Confocal quadrics capture (encode) and geometrize spectral properties of symmetric operators.	Certain metric-projective properties of confocal quadrics (most of them established in the first half of the XIX _EQN_ century) carry out (stick and transfer) by rolling to and influence surfaces applicable (isometric) to quadrics and surfaces geometrically linked to these, thus providing a wealth of integrable systems and projective transformations of their solutions.
doc	A solution with free boundary for non-Newtonian fluids with Drucker-Prager plasticity criterion EOS We study a free boundary problem which is motivated by a particular case of the flow of a non-Newtonian fluid, with a pressure depending yield stress given by a Drucker-Prager plasticity criterion. EOS We focus on the steady case and reformulate the equation as a variational problem. EOS The resulting energy has a term with linear growth while we study the problem in an unbounded domain. EOS We derive an Euler-Lagrange equation and prove a comparison principle. EOS We are then able to construct a subsolution and a supersolution which quantify the natural and expected properties of the solution; EOS in particular they show that the solution has in fact compact support, the boundary of which is the free boundary. EOS The model describes the flow of a non-Newtonian material on an inclined plane with walls, driven by gravity.	We show that there is a critical angle for a non-zero solution to exist.
doc	How many suns are in the sky? A SPHERE multiplicity survey of exoplanet host stars I -- Four new close stellar companions including a white dwarf EOS We are studying the influence of stellar multiplicity on exoplanet systems, in particular systems that have been detected via radial-velocity searches. EOS We are in particular interested in the closest companions as they would have a strong influence on the evolution of the original planet forming disks. EOS In this study we present new companions detected during our ongoing survey of exoplanet hosts with VLT/SPHERE. EOS We are using the extreme adaptive optics imager SPHERE at the ESO/VLT to search for faint (sub)stellar companions. EOS We utilized the classical coronagraphic imaging mode to perform a snapshot survey (3-6 min integration time) of exoplanet host stars in the Ks-band. EOS We detected new stellar companions to the exoplanet host stars HD1666, HIP68468, HIP107773, and HD109271. EOS With an angular separation of only 0.38" (40 au of projected separation) HIP107773 is among the closest companions found to exoplanet host stars. EOS The presence of the stellar companion explains the linear radial-velocity trend seen in the system.	At such a small separation the companion likely had significant influence on the evolution of the planet forming disk around the primary star.
doc	Multi-Frequency Analysis of the New Wide-Separation Gravitational Lens Candidate RX J0921+4529 EOS We report the discovery of a new two-image gravitational lens candidate. EOS The system RX J0921+4529 contains two z_s=1.66 quasars separated by 6."93 with an H band magnitude difference of _EQN_. EOS The HST NIC2 H band images reveal an H=18.2 spiral galaxy between the quasar images, which is probably a member of a z_l=0.32 X-ray cluster centered on the field.	We detect an extended source near the fainter quasar image but not in the brighter image.
doc	Transmuted Generalized Inverse Weibull Distribution EOS A generalization of the generalized inverse Weibull distribution so-called transmuted generalized inverse Weibull dis- tribution is proposed and studied.	We will use the quadratic rank transmutation map (QRTM) in order to generate a flexible family of probability distributions taking generalized inverse Weibull distribution as the base value distribution by introducing a new parameter that would offer more distributional flexibility.

EOS The stomatognathic system consists of the teeth and the skull bones with the maxilla and the mandible.	Its dynamics can be described by the change of mutual position of the lower/mandibular part versus the upper/maxillary one due to the physiological motion of opening, chewing and swallowing.

doc	Tagged particle in single-file diffusion with arbitrary initial conditions EOS We compute the full probability distribution of the positions of a tagged particle exactly for given arbitrary initial positions of the particles and for general single-particle propagators. EOS We consider the thermodynamic limit of our exact expressions in quenched and annealed settings. EOS For a particular class of single-particle propagators, the exact formula is expressed in a simple integral form in the quenched case whereas in the annealed case, it is expressed as a simple combination of Bessel functions.	In particular, we focus on the step and the power-law initial configurations.
doc	Bregman Distance to L1 Regularized Logistic Regression EOS In this work we investigate the relationship between Bregman distances and regularized Logistic Regression model. EOS We present a detailed study of Bregman Distance minimization, a family of generalized entropy measures associated with convex functions.	We convert the L1-regularized logistic regression into this more general framework and propose a primal-dual method based algorithm for learning the parameters.
doc	The distance scale and Eddington efficiency of luminous quasars EOS The relation between the central mass and quasar luminosity (M_BH \propto L^ \alpha FHWM^2) links a given Eddington ratio with a value of H_0, within a cosmology with fixed (\Omega_m,\Omega_ \Lambda).	We point out that because the relation is calibrated at low z using distance independent reverberation mapping to get the BLR size, the derived M_BH interestingly does not depend on H_0, while L/L_Edd is sensitive to H_0, but rather robust to changes of \Omega_ \Lambda in the standard flat model.
doc	Amplification, Saturation, and Q Thresholds for Runaway: Growth of Self-Gravitating Structures in Models of Magnetized Galactic Gas Disks EOS We investigate the susceptibility of gaseous, magnetized galactic disks to formation of self-gravitating condensations using two-dimensional, local models. EOS We focus on two issues: (1) determining the threshold condition for gravitational runaway, taking into account nonlinear effects, and (2) distinguishing the magneto-Jeans instability (MJI) that arises under inner-galaxy rotation curves from the modified swing amplification (MSA) that arises under outer-galaxy rotation curves.	For axisymmetric density fluctuations, instability is known to require a Toomre parameter Q<1.
doc	Atomic and Molecular Aspects of Astronomical Spectra EOS In the first section we present the atomic part where a C2+ atomic target was prepared and used to generate theoretical data to investigate recombination lines arising from electron-ion collisions in thin plasma. EOS R-matrix method was used to describe the C2+ plus electron system. EOS Theoretical data concerning bound and autoionizing states were generated in the intermediate-coupling approximation. EOS The data were used to generate dielectronic recombination data for C+ which include transition lines, oscillator strengths, radiative transition probabilities, emissivities and dielectronic recombination coefficients. EOS The data were cast in a line list containing 6187 optically-allowed transitions which include many C II lines observed in astronomical spectra.	This line list was used to analyze the spectra from a number of astronomical objects, mainly planetary nebulae, and identify their electron temperature.
doc	Dust in the wind: Crystalline silicates, corundum and periclase in PG 2112+059 EOS We have determined the mineralogical composition of dust in the Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasar PG 2112+059 using mid-infrared spectroscopy obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. EOS From spectral fitting of the solid state features, we find evidence for Mg-rich amorphous silicates with olivine stoichiometry, as well as the first detection of corundum (Al_2O_3) and periclase (MgO) in quasars. EOS This mixed composition provides the first direct evidence for a clumpy density structure of the grain forming region. EOS The silicates in total encompass 56.5% of the identified dust mass, while corundum takes up 38 wt.%. EOS Depending on the choice of continuum, a range of mass fractions is observed for periclase ranging from 2.7% in the most conservative case to 9% in a less constrained continuum. EOS In addition, we identify a feature at 11.2 micron as the crystalline silicate forsterite, with only a minor contribution from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.	The 5% crystalline silicate fraction requires high temperatures such as those found in the immediate quasar environment in order to counteract rapid destruction from cosmic rays.
doc	Sidon Basis EOS Erd\"os conjectured the existence of an infinite Sidon sequence of positive integers which is also an asymptotic basis of order 3. EOS We make progress towards this conjecture in several directions. EOS First we prove the conjecture for all cyclic groups Z_N with N large enough. EOS In second place we prove by probabilistic methods that there is an infinite B_2 sequence which is an asymptotic basis of order 3.	Finally we prove that for all c>0 there is a Sidon sequence which is an asymptotic basis of order 3+c,that is to say, any positive sufficiently large integer n can be written as a sum of 4 elements of the sequence, one of them smaller than n^c.

doc	The galaxy cluster mass scale and its impact on cosmological constraints from the cluster population EOS The total mass of a galaxy cluster is one of its most fundamental properties. EOS Together with the redshift, the mass links observation and theory, allowing us to use the cluster population to test models of structure formation and to constrain cosmological parameters. EOS Building on the rich heritage from X-ray surveys, new results from Sunyaev-Zeldovich and optical surveys have stimulated a resurgence of interest in cluster cosmology. EOS These studies have generally found fewer clusters than predicted by the baseline Planck LCDM model, prompting a renewed effort on the part of the community to obtain a definitive measure of the true cluster mass scale. EOS Here we review recent progress on this front.	Our theoretical understanding continues to advance, with numerical simulations being the cornerstone of this effort.
doc	Bifurcations in the optimal elastic foundation for a buckling column EOS We investigate the buckling under compression of a slender beam with a distributed lateral elastic support, for which there is an associated cost. EOS For a given cost, we study the optimal choice of support to protect against Euler buckling. EOS We show that with only weak lateral support, the optimum distribution is a delta-function at the centre of the beam.	When more support is allowed, we find numerically that the optimal distribution undergoes a series of bifurcations.
doc	Geometric Numerical Integration of Inequality Constrained, Nonsmooth Hamiltonian Systems EOS We consider the geometric numerical integration of Hamiltonian systems subject to both equality and "hard" inequality constraints. EOS As in the standard geometric integration setting, we target long-term structure preservation. EOS We additionally, however, also consider invariant preservation over persistent, simultaneous and/or frequent boundary interactions.	Appropriately formulating geometric methods to include such conditions has long-remained challenging due to the inherent nonsmoothness they impose.
doc	Observation of forbidden phonons and dark excitons by resonance Raman scattering in few-layer WS _EQN_ EOS The optical properties of the two-dimensional (2D) crystals are dominated by tightly bound electron-hole pairs (excitons) and lattice vibration modes (phonons). EOS The exciton-phonon interaction is fundamentally important to understand the optical properties of 2D materials and thus help develop emerging 2D crystal based optoelectronic devices. EOS Here, we presented the excitonic resonant Raman scattering (RRS) spectra of few-layer WS _EQN_ excited by 11 lasers lines covered all of A, B and C exciton transition energies at different sample temperatures from 4 to 300 K. EOS As a result, we are not only able to probe the forbidden phonon modes unobserved in ordinary Raman scattering, but also can determine the bright and dark state fine structures of 1s A exciton.	In particular, we also observed the quantum interference between low-energy discrete phonon and exciton continuum under resonant excitation.
doc	Tidal Downsizing model. I. Numerical methods: saving giant planets from tidal disruptions EOS Tidal Downsizing (TD) is a recently developed planet formation theory that supplements the classical Gravitational disc Instability (GI) model with planet migration inward and tidal disruptions of GI fragments in the inner regions of the disc.	Numerical methods for a detailed population synthesis of TD planets are presented here.
doc	Quantum state diffusion, measurement and second quantization EOS Realistic dynamical theories of measurement based on the diffusion of quantum states are nonunitary, whereas quantum field theory and its generalizations are unitary. EOS This problem in the quantum field theory of quantum state diffusion (QSD) appears already in the Lagrangian formulation of QSD as a classical equation of motion, where Liouville's theorem does not apply to the usual field theory formulation. EOS This problem is resolved here by doubling the number of freedoms used to represent a quantum field.	The space of quantum fields is then a classical configuration space, for which volume need not be conserved, instead of the usual phase space, to which Liouville's theorem applies.

EOS The powder diffraction experiment confirms formation of a long-range magnetic order at _EQN_ K, where a sinusoidally modulated structure is realized with the modulation vector _EQN_. EOS Inelastic excitation spectra in the paramagnetic phase comprise significantly broad quasielastic and inelastic peaks centered at _EQN_ and 65 meV.	Crystalline-electric-field (CEF) analysis satisfactorily reproduces the observed spectra, confirming their CEF origin.

This allows for sterile neutrinos to be a dark matter candidate.
doc	Hazard rate estimation for location-scale distributions under complete and censored data EOS In reliability and life testing studies, the topic of estimating hazard rate has received great attention in recent years since an estimate of hazard rate is a quite useful tool for making decisions. EOS Some works have included nonparametric approaches while some have considered parametric structural models for complete as well as censored data sets; EOS see Meeker et al (1992), Antoniadis and Gr\'egoire (1999), Rai and Singh (2003), Bezandry et al (2005), Brunel and Comte (2008), and Mahapatra et al (2012). EOS Depending on the shapes of the hazard rate, efficiencies differ markedly across proposed estimators. EOS This situation is remarkable especially when different estimation techniques are utilized for unknown parameters of underlying distributions in parametric approaches. EOS That is, estimated hazard rate (and also reliability) at a specific time point t as functions of these estimators leads to inconsistent coverage probabilities as distributional convergence of hazard rate estimator may not be at the desired rate for certain sample sizes. EOS This manuscript focuses on the estimation of monotone hazard rate when the distribution of concern is of location-scale type.	A very simple and efficient approximation of hazard rate for a complete sample is introduced as a function of order statistics, which allows a fast convergence to the asymptotic distribution while achieving highly accurate coverage probabilities for confidence intervals (CI).

doc	Polarization in Quarkonium Production EOS Production mechanisms for quarkonium states in hadronic collisions remain difficult to understand. EOS The decay angular distributions of J/ _EQN_ or _EQN_ states into _EQN_ final states are sensitive to the matrix elements in the production process and provide a unique tool to evaluate different models. EOS This talk will focus on new results for the spin alignment of _EQN_ states produced in _EQN_ collisions at _EQN_ = 1.96 TeV using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. EOS The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 6.7 fb _EQN_.	The angular distributions are analyzed as functions of the transverse momentum of the dimuon final state in both the Collins-Soper and the s-channel helicity frames using a unique data-driven background determination method.

doc	Subdiffusion in a system with a partially permeable partially absorbing wall EOS We consider subdiffusion of a particle in a one-dimensional system with a thin partially permeable wall. EOS Passing through the wall, the particle can be absorbed with a certain probability. EOS We call such a wall partially permeable partially absorbing wall (PPAW). EOS Using the diffusion model in a system with discrete time and spatial variable, probability densities (Green's functions) describing subdiffusion in the system have been derived. EOS Knowing the Green's functions we derive boundary conditions at the wall. EOS The boundary conditions take a specific form in which time derivatives of the fractional order controlled by the subdiffusion parameter are involved.	We assume that the absorption of a particle can occur only when the particle jumps through the wall.
doc	Free path lengths in quasicrystals EOS Previous studies of kinetic transport in the Lorentz gas have been limited to cases where the scatterers are distributed at random (e.g. EOS at the points of a spatial Poisson process) or at the vertices of a Euclidean lattice. EOS In the present paper we investigate quasicrystalline scatterer configurations, which are non-periodic, yet strongly correlated. EOS A famous example is the vertex set of the Penrose tiling.	Our main result proves the existence of a limit distribution of the free path length, which answers a question of Wennberg.

doc	CP violating anomalous couplings in _EQN_ jet production at the LHC EOS T-odd correlations in _EQN_ production at the LHC have been studied recently as a way to measure a phase produced by QCD at NLO by Frederix et. EOS al. EOS That study found that the induced asymmetry could be observed with 20 fb _EQN_ of 8 TeV data. EOS These T-odd asymmetries can also be induced by CP violating new physics interfering with the SM at LO. EOS In this paper we study this possibility using effective Lagrangians to describe the new physics. EOS We find that the leading contribution arises at dimension eight, and that it necessarily introduces flavor changing neutral currents as well.	We discuss the constraints that can be placed on the flavor structure of the new physics operator from studies of FCNC in kaon and B meson decays and then compare the T-odd correlations in _EQN_ induced by CP violating new physics to those induced by QCD at NLO.

In this regime, the CR flux has to be calculated numerically.
doc	Logical and algebraic properties of generalized orthomodular posets EOS Generalized orthomodular posets were introduced recently by D. EOS Fazio, A. EOS Ledda and the first author of the present paper in order to establish a useful tool for studying the logic of quantum mechanics. EOS They investigated structural properties of these posets. EOS In the present paper we study logical and algebraic properties of these posets. EOS In particular, we investigate conditions under which they can be converted into operator residuated structures.	Further, we study their representation by means of algebras (directoids) with everywhere defined operations.
doc	Effects of network topology, transmission delays, and refractoriness on the response of coupled excitable systems to a stochastic stimulus EOS We study the effects of network topology on the response of networks of coupled discrete excitable systems to an external stochastic stimulus. EOS We extend recent results that characterize the response in terms of spectral properties of the adjacency matrix by allowing distributions in the transmission delays and in the number of refractory states, and by developing a nonperturbative approximation to the steady state network response. EOS We confirm our theoretical results with numerical simulations.	We find that the steady state response amplitude is inversely proportional to the duration of refractoriness, which reduces the maximum attainable dynamic range.
doc	Higgs bundles for real groups and the Hitchin-Kostant-Rallis section EOS We consider the moduli space of polystable _EQN_ -twisted _EQN_ -Higgs bundles over a compact Riemann surface _EQN_, where _EQN_ is a real reductive Lie group, and _EQN_ is a holomorphic line bundle over _EQN_. EOS Evaluating the Higgs field at a basis of the ring of polynomial invariants of the isotropy representation, one defines the Hitchin map. EOS This is a map to an affine space, whose dimension is determined by _EQN_ and the degrees of the polynomials in the basis.	Building up on the work of Kostant-Rallis and Hitchin, in this paper, as a first step in the study of the Hitchin map, we construct a section of this map.

doc	Generalised ballooning theory of two dimensional tokamak modes EOS In this work, using solutions from a local gyrokinetic flux-tube code combined with higher order ballooning theory, a new analytical approach is developed to reconstruct the global linear mode structure with associated global mode frequency.	In addition to the isolated mode (IM), which usually peaks on the outboard mid-plane, the higher order ballooning theory has also captured other types of less unstable global modes: (a) the weakly asymmetric ballooning theory (WABT) predicts a mixed mode (MM) that undergoes a small poloidal shift away from the outboard mid-plane, (b) a relatively more stable general mode (GM) balloons on the top (or bottom) of the tokamak plasma.

doc	Parametric Lattice Boltzmann Method EOS The discretized equilibrium distributions of the lattice Boltzmann method are presented by using the coefficients of the Lagrange interpolating polynomials that pass through the points related to discrete velocities and using moments of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. EOS The ranges of flow velocity and temperature providing positive valued distributions vary with regulating discrete velocities as parameters. EOS New isothermal and thermal compressible models are proposed for flows of the level of the isothermal and thermal compressible Navier-Stokes equations. EOS Thermal compressible shock tube flows are simulated by only five on-lattice discrete velocities.	Two-dimensional isothermal and thermal vortices provoked by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are simulated by the parametric models.

Because of smearing effect via kinetic mixing, one can realize a hierarchy such as _EQN_ - _EQN_, but it is very difficult to achieve the mass ratio between the up and top quarks (_EQN_) on the complicated magnetized orbifolds _EQN_.

EOS It can be also viewed as the effective quantum mechanics of zero momentum modes of the original theory. EOS These systems were first considered in 80's as simple models with supersymmetry.	Independently, zero-volume field theories (especially pure Yang-Mills) were employed as the starting point of the small volume expansion, which is an important theoretical tool complementary to early lattice calculations.

doc	Parameter estimation for integer-valued Gibbs distributions EOS We consider Gibbs distributions, which are families of probability distributions over a discrete space _EQN_ with probability mass function given by _EQN_. EOS Here _EQN_ is a fixed function (called a Hamiltonian), _EQN_ is the parameter of the distribution, and the normalization factor _EQN_ is called the partition function. EOS We study how function _EQN_ can be estimated using an oracle that produces samples _EQN_ for a value _EQN_ in a given interval _EQN_. EOS We consider the problem of estimating the normalized coefficients _EQN_ for indices _EQN_ satisfying _EQN_, where _EQN_ is a given parameter and _EQN_ is a given subset of _EQN_. EOS We solve this using _EQN_ samples where _EQN_, and we show this is optimal up to logarithmic factors. EOS We also improve the sample complexity to roughly _EQN_ for applications where the coefficients are log-concave (e.g. EOS counting connected subgraphs of a given graph).	As a key subroutine, we show how to estimate _EQN_ using _EQN_ samples.
doc	Forever alone? Testing single eccentric planetary systems for multiple companions EOS Determining the orbital eccentricity of an extrasolar planet is critically important for understanding the system's dynamical environment and history. EOS However, eccentricity is often poorly determined or entirely mischaracterized due to poor observational sampling, low signal-to-noise, and/or degeneracies with other planetary signals. EOS Some systems previously thought to contain a single, moderate-eccentricity planet have been shown, after further monitoring, to host two planets on nearly-circular orbits.	We investigate published apparent single-planet systems to see if the available data can be better fit by two lower-eccentricity planets.
doc	Optimized Sampling of Mixed-State Observables EOS Quantum dynamical simulations of statistical ensembles pose a significant computational challenge due to the fact that mixed states need to be represented.

doc	Distributed Non-Convex Optimization with Sublinear Speedup under Intermittent Client Availability EOS Federated learning is a new distributed machine learning framework, where a bunch of heterogeneous clients collaboratively train a model without sharing training data. EOS In this work, we consider a practical and ubiquitous issue in federated learning: intermittent client availability, where the set of eligible clients may change during the training process. EOS Such an intermittent client availability model would significantly deteriorate the performance of the classical Federated Averaging algorithm (FedAvg for short).	We propose a simple distributed non-convex optimization algorithm, called Federated Latest Averaging (FedLaAvg for short), which leverages the latest gradients of all clients, even when the clients are not available, to jointly update the global model in each iteration.
doc	No Radial Excitations in Low Energy QCD. I. Diquarks and Classification of Mesons EOS We propose a new schematic model for mesons in which the building blocks are quarks and flavor-antisymmetric diquarks. EOS The outcome is a new classification of the entire meson spectrum into quark-antiquark and diquark-antidiquark states which does not give rise to a radial quantum number: all mesons which have so far been believed to be radially excited are orbitally excited diquark-antidiquark states; EOS similarly, there are no radially excited baryons. EOS Further, mesons that were previously viewed as "exotic" are no longer exotic as they are now naturally integrated into the classification as diquark-antidiquark states. EOS The classification also leads to the introduction of isorons (iso-hadrons), which are analogs of atomic isotopes, and their magic quantum numbers, which are analogs of the magic numbers of the nuclear shell model. EOS The magic quantum numbers of isorons match the quantum numbers expected for low-lying glueballs in lattice QCD. EOS We observe that interquark forces in mesons behave substantially differently from those in baryons: qualitatively, they are color-magnetic in mesons but color-electrostatic in baryons. EOS We comment on potential models and the hydrogen atom.	The implications of our results for confinement, asymptotic freedom, and a new set of relations between two fundamental properties of hadrons - their size and their energy - are discussed in our companion paper [arXiv:0910.2231].

doc	Transmon-based simulator of nonlocal electron-phonon coupling: A platform for observing sharp small-polaron transitions EOS We propose an analog superconducting quantum simulator for a one-dimensional model featuring momentum-dependent (nonlocal) electron-phonon couplings of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and "breathing-mode" types.	Because its corresponding vertex function depends on both the electron- and phonon quasimomenta, this model does not belong to the realm of validity of the Gerlach-L\" o wen theorem that rules out any nonanalyticities in single-particle properties.

EOS The tree models an establishment's propensity to respond to the survey given certain establishment characteristics. EOS It provides mutually exclusive cells based on the characteristics with homogeneous response propensities.	This makes it easy to identify interpretable associations between the characteristic variables and an establishment's propensity to respond, something not easily done using a logistic regression propensity model.

doc	Rate Analysis or a Possible Interpretation of Abundances EOS Heavy elements are formed in nucleosynthesis processes. EOS Abundances of these elements can be classified as elemental abundance, isotopic abundance, and abundance of nuclei.

We are interested in the neutron density required to reproduce the measured abundance of nuclei assuming equilibrium processes.
doc	Nonclassical correlations from randomly chosen local measurements EOS We show that correlations inconsistent with any locally causal description can be a generic feature of measurements on entangled quantum states.

doc	Time-dependent Stochastic Bethe-Salpeter Approach EOS A time-dependent formulation for electron-hole excitations in extended finite systems, based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), is developed using a stochastic wave function approach. EOS The time-dependent formulation builds on the connection between time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory and configuration-interaction with single substitution (CIS) method.	This results in a time dependent Schr\"odinger-like equation for the quasiparticle orbital dynamics based on an effective Hamiltonian containing direct Hartree and screened exchange terms, where screening is described within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA).
doc	Optomechanical measurement of photon spin angular momentum and optical torque in integrated photonic devices EOS Photons carry linear momentum, and spin angular momentum when circularly or elliptically polarized. EOS During light-matter interaction, transfer of linear momentum leads to optical forces, while angular momentum transfer induces optical torque. EOS Optical forces including radiation pressure and gradient forces have long been utilized in optical tweezers and laser cooling. EOS In nanophotonic devices optical forces can be significantly enhanced, leading to unprecedented optomechanical effects in both classical and quantum regimes. EOS In contrast, to date, the angular momentum of light and the optical torque effect remain unexplored in integrated photonics. EOS Here, we demonstrate the measurement of the spin angular momentum of photons propagating in a birefringent waveguide and the use of optical torque to actuate rotational motion of an optomechanical device. EOS We show that the sign and magnitude of the optical torque are determined by the photon polarization states that are synthesized on the chip.	Our study reveals the mechanical effect of photon's polarization degree of freedom and demonstrates its control in integrated photonic devices.

In this reply we calculate the propagation of a plane wave through both a lens and a slab of aluminum cylinders, identical to those presented by such authors in previous experiments, by using a finite difference time domain (FDTD) method.
doc	Evaluation of Cooling Solutions for Outdoor Electronics EOS The thermal management of an outdoor electronic enclosure can be quite challenging due to the additional thermal load from the sun and the requirement of having an air-sealed enclosure. EOS It is essential to consider the effect of solar heating loads in the design process; EOS otherwise, it can shorten the life expectancy of the electronic product or lead to catastrophic failure. EOS In this paper we analyze and compare the effectiveness of different cooling techniques used for outdoor electronics. EOS Various cooling techniques were compared like special coatings and paints on the outer surface, radiation shields, double-walled vented enclosures, fans for internal air circulation and air-to-air heat exchangers. EOS A highly simplified, typical outdoor system was selected for this study measuring approximately 300x300x400 mm (WxLxH).	Solar radiation was incident on 3 sides of the enclosure.

EOS Complex structures present in these active Algol systems could be studied with the eclipse-mapping method which was successfully applied to the new 7-color photometric observations in the Geneva system of W Cru, belonging to the isolated group of these active Algols.	Several cycles of this long-period (198.5 days) eclipsing binary have been covered by observations.

doc	Identification of Young Stellar Object candidates in the _EQN_ DR2 x AllWISE catalogue with machine learning methods EOS The second _EQN_ Data Release (DR2) contains astrometric and photometric data for more than 1.6 billion objects with mean _EQN_ _EQN_ magnitude _EQN_ 20.7, including many Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) in different evolutionary stages. EOS In order to explore the YSO population of the Milky Way, we combined the _EQN_ DR2 database with WISE and Planck measurements and made an all-sky probabilistic catalogue of YSOs using machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or Neural Networks. EOS Our input catalogue contains 103 million objects from the DR2xAllWISE cross-match table. EOS We classified each object into four main classes: YSOs, extragalactic objects, main-sequence stars and evolved stars. EOS At a 90% probability threshold we identified 1,129,295 YSO candidates. EOS To demonstrate the quality and potential of our YSO catalogue, here we present two applications of it.

(2) We use our catalogue to classify published _EQN_ Science Alerts.
doc	Efficient Multi-Jet Merging at High Multiplicities EOS We here present an extension of the CKKW-L multi-jet merging technique to so-called sector showers as implemented in the Vincia antenna shower. EOS The bijective nature of sector showers allows for efficient multi-jet merging at high multiplicities, as any given configuration possesses only a single "history", while retaining the accuracy of the CKKW-L technique. EOS Our method reduces the factorial scaling of the number of parton shower histories to a constant of a single history per colour-ordered final state. EOS We show that the complexity of constructing shower histories is reduced to an effective linear scaling with the number of final-state particles. EOS Moreover, we demonstrate that the overall event generation time and the memory footprint of our implementation remain approximately constant when including additional jets. EOS We compare both to the conventional CKKW-L implementation in Pythia and gain a first estimate of renormalisation scale uncertainties at high merged multiplicities. EOS As a proof of concept, we show parton-level predictions for vector boson production in proton-proton collisions with up to nine hard jets using the new implementation.	Despite its much simpler nature, we dub the new technique MESS, in analogy to the conventional MEPS nomenclature.
doc	123-321 Models of Classical Novae EOS High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed large concentrations of CNO and sometimes other intermediate-mass elements in the shells ejected during nova outbursts, suggesting that the solar composition material transferred from the secondary mixes with the outermost layers of the underlying white dwarf during the thermonuclear runaway. EOS Multidimensional simulations have shown that Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities provide self-enrichment of the accreted envelope with material from the outermost layers of the white dwarf, at levels that agree with observations. EOS However, the Eulerian and time-explicit nature of most multidimensional codes used to date and the overwhelming computational load have limited their applicability, and no multidimensional simulation has been conducted for a full nova cycle. EOS This paper explores a new methodology that combines 1-D and 3-D simulations. EOS The early stages of the explosion (i.e., mass-accretion and initiation of the runaway) have been computed with the 1-D hydrodynamic code SHIVA.	When convection extends throughout the entire envelope, the structures for each model were mapped into 3-D Cartesian grids and were subsequently followed with the multidimensional code FLASH.

EOS The noble metal nanoparticles (NP) as promising materials with antiviral and antibacterial properties can deliver the drug to the target agent and decrease the side effect. EOS In this work, we have applied quantum mechanical and classical atomistic molecular dynamics computational approaches to demonstrate the adsorption properties of HCQ on Ag, Au, AgAu, and Pt nanoparticles. EOS The adsorption energies (less than -30 kcal/mole) were established for HCQ, and the (non)perturbative effects of this drug on the plasmonic absorption spectra of AgNP and AuNP have characterized with time-dependent density functional theory.	The effect of size and compositions of nanoparticle on the coating with HCQ and CQ have obtained and proposed the appropriate candidate for drug delivery.

EOS In order to accomplish this task, parts of Karr's difference field theory have been extended to a ring theory in which also the alternating sign can be expressed. EOS The underlying machinery relies on algorithms that compute all solutions of a given parameterized telescoping equation.	As a consequence, we can solve the telescoping and creative telescoping problem in such difference rings.

EOS We were able to distinguish the samples by their slightly different quadrupole frequencies, _EQN_, which is a direct measure of the electric field gradient (EFG) at the As site.	Interestingly, samples with a large quadrupole frequency appear to show a different Knight shift and spin lattice relaxation in the superconducting state from those with a lower _EQN_, yet all the samples are clearly superconducting.
doc	Photorealistic Facial Expression Synthesis by the Conditional Difference Adversarial Autoencoder EOS Photorealistic facial expression synthesis from single face image can be widely applied to face recognition, data augmentation for emotion recognition or entertainment. EOS This problem is challenging, in part due to a paucity of labeled facial expression data, making it difficult for algorithms to disambiguate changes due to identity and changes due to expression. EOS In this paper, we propose the conditional difference adversarial autoencoder, CDAAE, for facial expression synthesis. EOS The CDAAE takes a facial image of a previously unseen person and generates an image of that human face with a target emotion or facial action unit label. EOS The CDAAE adds a feedforward path to an autoencoder structure connecting low level features at the encoder to features at the corresponding level at the decoder. EOS It handles the problem of disambiguating changes due to identity and changes due to facial expression by learning to generate the difference between low-level features of images of the same person but with different facial expressions. EOS The CDAAE structure can be used to generate novel expressions by combining and interpolating between facial expressions/action units within the training set. EOS Our experimental results demonstrate that the CDAAE can preserve identity information when generating facial expression for unseen subjects more faithfully than previous approaches.	This is especially advantageous when training with small databases.
doc	Geometry and Dynamics of Emergent Spacetime from Entanglement Spectrum EOS We examine geometry and dynamics of classical spacetime derived from entanglement spectrum. EOS The spacetime is a kind of canonical parameter space defined by the Fisher information metric. EOS As a concrete example, we focus on the spectrum for free fermions in spatially one dimension. EOS The spectrum has exponential family form like thermal probability distribution owing to mixed-state feature emerging from truncation of environmental degrees of freedom. EOS In this case, the Fisher metric is given by the second derivative of the Hessian potential that can be identified with the entanglement entropy. EOS We emphasize that the canonical parameters are nontrivial functions of partial system size by the truncation, filling fraction of fermions, and time. EOS Then, the precise determination of this nontrivial mapping is necessary to derive the functional form of the Hessian potential that leads to correct entanglement entropy scaling.	By this potential, we find that the emergent geometry becomes anti-de Sitter spacetime with imaginary time, and a radial axis as well as spacetime coordinates appears spontaneously.

EOS It is significant to understand the information diffusion pattern under such a communication structure, where an essential task is to predict the arrival time of future events. EOS In this work, we proposed a novel yet simple framework, called SocialGrid, for modeling events in online discussing forms.	Our framework first transforms the entire event space into a grid representation by grouping successive evens in one time interval of a particular length.

doc	Generating Fano Resonances in a single-waveguide nanobeam cavity for efficient electro-optical modulation EOS We propose a method for generating Fano resonance in a standalone silicon nanobeam cavity which eliminates the inconvenience from the unexpected side-coupled bus waveguide and unlocks new opportunities to develop ultra-compact and ultra-fast electro-optical modulators.. EOS Taking advantage from a spatial-division multiplexing principle of operation between transverse electric modes, a sharp resonant mode and an efficient flat background mode are simultaneously generated in the same silicon channel for the realization of efficient Fano resonances. EOS Unambiguous asymmetric spectrum lineshapes are thoroughly investigated using numerical and analytical methods and experimentally demonstrated in the near infra-red around lambda=1.55 \mu m, presenting an extinction ratio of about 17dB for a delta lambda =56 pm wavelength detuning for the 1st cavity mode (Q-factor Q=34000), and higher than 23 dB extinction ratio for a delta lambda=366 pm detuning for the 2nd cavity mode (Q=5600).	These extinction ratios are 10~15 dB larger than their Lorentzian counterparts exhibiting similar Q factors.
doc	A local theory of Quantum Mechanics EOS It is shown that Quantum Mechanics is ambiguous when predicting relative frequencies for an entangled system if the measurements of both subsystems are performed in spatially separated events. EOS This ambiguity gives way to unphysical consequences: the projection rule could be applied in one or the other temporal(? EOS) order of measurements (being non local in any case), but symmetry of the roles of both subsystems would be broken. EOS An alternative theory is presented in which this ambiguity does not exist. EOS Observable relative frequencies differ from those of orthodox Quantum Mechanics, and a gendaken experiment is proposed to falsify one or the other theory. EOS In the alternative theory, each subsystem has an individual state in its own Hilbert space, and the total system state is direct product (rank one) of both, so there is no entanglement. EOS Correlation between subsystems appears through a hidden label that prescribes the output of arbitrary hypothetical measurements. EOS Measurement is treated as a usual reversible interaction, and this postulate allows to determine relative frequencies when the value of a magnitude is known without in any way perturbing the system, by measurement of the correlated companion.	It is predicted the existence of an accompanying system, the de Broglie wave, introduced in order to preserve the action reaction principle in indirect measurements, when there is no interaction of detector and particle.
doc	Neutrino Portal Dark Matter: From Dwarf Galaxies to IceCube EOS It has been suggested that the baseline scenario of collisionless cold dark matter over-predicts the numbers of satellite galaxies, as well as the dark matter (DM) densities in galactic centers. EOS This apparent lack of structure at small scales can be accounted for if one postulates neutrino-DM and DM-DM interactions mediated by light O(MeV) force carriers.	In this letter, we consider a simple, consistent model of neutrinophilic DM with these features where DM and a "secluded" SM-singlet neutrino species are charged under a new _EQN_ gauge symmetry.
doc	Violence in the Dark Ages EOS A wide range of observational and theoretical arguments suggest that the universe experienced a period of heating and metal enrichment, most likely from starbursting dwarf galaxies. EOS Using a hydrodynamic simulation we have conducted a uniquely detailed theoretical investigation of this epoch at the end of the cosmological ``dark ages''. EOS Outflows strip baryons from pre-viralized halos with total masses _EQN_ M _EQN_, reducing their number density and the overall star formation rate, while pushing these quantities toward their observed values. EOS We show that the metallicity of _EQN_ M _EQN_ objects increases with size, but with a large scatter, reproducing the metallicity-luminosity relation of dwarf galaxies. EOS Galaxies _EQN_ M _EQN_ form with a roughly constant initial metallicity of 10% solar, explaining the observed lack of metal-poor disk stars in these objects.	Outflows enrich roughly 20% of the simulation volume, yielding a mean metallicity of 0.3% solar, in agreement with observations of CIV in QSO absorption-line systems.
doc	Transport and optical properties of warm dense aluminum in the two-temperature regime: Ab initio calculation and semiempirical approximation EOS This work is devoted to the investigation of transport and optical properties of liquid aluminum in the two-temperature case. EOS At first optical properties, static electrical and thermal conductivities were obtained in the \textit ab initio calculation. EOS The \textit ab initio calculation is based on the quantum molecular dynamics, density functional theory and the Kubo-Greenwood formula. EOS The semiempirical approximation was constructed based on the results of the \textit ab initio caculation. EOS The approximation yields the dependences _EQN_ and _EQN_ for the static electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, respectively. EOS The approximation is valid for liquid aluminum at _EQN_ ~g/cm _EQN_, 3~kK~ _EQN_ ~kK. EOS Our results are well described by the Drude model with the effective relaxation time _EQN_. EOS We have compared our results with a number of other models.	They are all reduced in the low-temperature limit to the Drude model with different expressions for the relaxation time _EQN_.

doc	Second-harmonic generation and linear electro-optical coefficients of SiC polytypes and nanotubes EOS The second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (_EQN_) and linear electro-optical coefficient (_EQN_) of a large number of single-walled zigzag, armchair and chiral SiC nanotubes (SiC-NTs) as well as bulk SiC polytypes (2H-, 4H-, 6H- and 3C-SiC) and single graphitic SiC sheet have been calculated from first-principles. EOS The calculations are based on density functional theory in the local density approximation and highly accurate full-potential projector augmented-wave method is used. EOS Both the zigzag and chiral SiC-NTs are found to exhibit large second-order nonlinear optical behavior with the _EQN_ and _EQN_ coefficients being up to ten-times larger than that of bulk SiC polytypes, and also being up to thirteen-times larger than the counterparts of the corresponding BN-NTs, indicating that SiC-NTs are promising materials for nonlinear optical and opto-electric applications.	The prominant features in the spectra of _EQN_ of the SiC-NTs are correlated with the features in the linear optical dielectric function _EQN_ in terms of single-photon and two-photon resonances.
doc	Warping, Extra Dimensions and a Slice of AdS_d EOS Inspired by the Randall-Sundrum (RS) framework we consider a number of phenomenologically relevant model building questions on a slice of compactified AdS_d for d >5. EOS Such spaces are interesting as they enable one to realize the weak scale via warping. EOS We perform the Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction for gravitons and bulk vectors in these spaces and for the case of AdS_6 consider the KK spectrum of gauge-scalars. EOS We further obtain the KK towers for bulk fermions on a slice of AdS_7 and AdS_9 and show that the RS approach to flavor generalizes to these spaces with the localization of chiral zero mode fermions controlled by their bulk Dirac mass parameters. EOS However for the phenomenologically interesting case where the transverse radius is R^ -1 \sim TeV we show that bulk Standard Model fields are not viable due to a resulting volume suppression of the gauge coupling constants. EOS A similar suppression occurs for the case of UV localization. EOS Thus it seems that the Standard Model fields should be confined to the infrared brane in such spaces. EOS Sterile fields and extended gauge sectors may propagate in the bulk with the gauge-coupling volume suppression experienced by the latter motivating a weak coupling to Standard Model fields.	We also discuss some issues regarding the effective 4D theory description in these spaces.
doc	Excited configurations of hydrogen in the BaTiO _EQN_ H _EQN_ perovskite lattice associated with hydrogen exchange and transport EOS Excited configurations of hydrogen in the oxyhydride BaTiO _EQN_ H _EQN_ (_EQN_), which are considered to be involved in its hydrogen transport and exchange processes, were investigated by positive muon spin relaxation (_EQN_ SR) spectroscopy using muonium (Mu) as a pseudoisotope of hydrogen. EOS Muons implanted into the BaTiO _EQN_ H _EQN_ perovskite lattice were mainly found in two qualitatively different metastable states. EOS One was assigned to a highly mobile interstitial protonic state, which is commonly observed in perovskite oxides. EOS The other was found to form an entangled two spin- _EQN_ system with the nuclear spin of an H _EQN_ ion at the anion site.	The structure of the (H,Mu) complex agrees well with that of a neutralized center containing two H _EQN_ ions at a doubly charged oxygen vacancy, which was predicted to form in the SrTiO _EQN_ perovskite lattice by a computational study [Y.
doc	Marginal Deformations with U(1)^3 Global Symmetry EOS We generate new 11-dimensional supergravity solutions from deformations based on U(1)^3 symmetries. EOS The initial geometries are of the form AdS_4 x Y_7, where Y_7 is a 7-dimensional Sasaki-Einstein space. EOS We consider a general family of cohomogeneity one Sasaki-Einstein spaces, as well as the recently-constructed cohomogeneity three L^ p,q,r,s spaces.	For certain cases, such as when the Sasaki-Einstein space is S^7, Q^ 1,1,1 or M^ 1,1,1, the deformed gravity solutions correspond to a marginal deformation of a known dual gauge theory.
doc	The Teichm\"uller and Riemann Moduli Stacks EOS The aim of this paper is to study the structure of the higher-dimensional Teichm\"uller and Riemann moduli spaces, viewed as stacks over the category of complex manifolds.

doc	On The Possible Mechanism Of Energy Dissipation In Shock-Wave Fronts Driven Ahead Of Coronal Mass Ejections EOS Analysis of Mark 4 and LASCO C2, C3 coronagraph data shows that, at the distance _EQN_ R _EQN_ from the center of the Sun, the thickness of a CME-generated shock-wave front (_EQN_) may be of order of the proton mean free path. EOS This means that the energy dissipation mechanism in the shock front at these distances is collisional. EOS A new discontinuity (thickness _EQN_) is observed to appear in the anterior part of the front at _EQN_ R _EQN_. EOS Within the limits of experimental error, the thickness _EQN_ 0.1-0.2 R _EQN_ does not vary with distance and is determined by the spatial resolution of the LASCO C3 instrument. EOS At the initial stage of formation, the discontinuity on the scale of _EQN_ has rather small amplitude and exists simultaneously with the front having thickness _EQN_. EOS The relative amplitude of the discontinuity gradually increases with distance, and the brightness profile behind it becomes even.	Such transformations may be associated with the transition from a collisional shock wave to a collisionless one.
doc	The VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS). Measuring nonlinear galaxy bias at z~0.8 EOS We use the first release of the VImos Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey of galaxies (VIPERS) of ~50,000 objects to measure the biasing relation between galaxies and mass in the redshift range z=[0.5,1.1]. EOS We estimate the 1-point distribution function [PDF] of VIPERS galaxies from counts in cells and, assuming a model for the mass PDF, we infer their mean bias relation. EOS The reconstruction of the bias relation from PDFs is performed through a novel method that accounts for Poisson noise, redshift distortions, inhomogeneous sky coverage and other selection effects. EOS With this procedure we constrain galaxy bias and its deviations from linearity down to scales as small as 4 Mpc/h and out to z=1.1. EOS We detect small (~3%) but significant deviations from linear bias. EOS The mean biasing function is close to linear in regions above the mean density. EOS The mean slope of the biasing relation is a proxy to the linear bias parameter. EOS It increases both with luminosity, in agreement with results of previous analyses, and with redshift. EOS However, we detect a strong bias evolution only for z>0.9 in agreement with some, but not all, previous studies. EOS We also detected a significant increase of the bias with the scale, from 4 to 8 Mpc/h, now seen for the first time out to z=1. EOS The amplitude of nonlinearity depends on redshift, luminosity and on scales but no clear trend is detected. EOS Thanks to the large cosmic volume probed by VIPERS we find that the mismatch between the previous estimates of bias at z~1 from zCOSMOS and VVDS-Deep galaxy samples is fully accounted for by cosmic variance.	The results of our work confirm the importance of going beyond the over-simplistic linear bias hypothesis showing that non-linearities can be accurately measured through the applications of the appropriate statistical tools to existing datasets like VIPERS.
doc	An in-plane hexagonal antiferromagnet in the Cu-Mn-As system, Cu _EQN_ Mn _EQN_ As EOS We report the single-crystal growth and characterization of a new hexagonal phase, Cu _EQN_ Mn _EQN_ As, in the Cu-Mn-As system. EOS This compound contains the same square-pyramidal MnAs _EQN_ units as the tetragonal and orthorhombic polymorphs of CuMnAs. EOS Calorimetry, magnetometry, and neutron diffraction measurements reveal antiferromagnetic ordering at 270 K.	The magnetic structure consists of a triangular arrangement of spins in the _EQN_ plane.
doc	Interlayer Breathing and Shear Modes in Few-Layer Black Phosphorus EOS The interlayer breathing and shear modes in few-layer black phosphorus are investigated for their symmetry and lattice dynamical properties. EOS The symmetry groups for the even-layer and odd-layer few-layer black phosphorus are utilized to determine the irreducible representation and the infrared and Raman activity for the interlayer modes. EOS The valence force field model is applied to calculate the eigenvectorw and frequencies for the interlayer breathing and shear modes, which are explained using the atomic chain model.	The anisotropic puckered configuration for black phosphorus leads to a highly anisotropic frequency for the two interlayer shear modes.
doc	A source of high-velocity white dwarfs EOS We investigate whether the recently-observed population of high-velocity white dwarfs can be derived from a population of binaries residing initially within the thin disk of the Galaxy.	In particular we consider binaries where the primary is sufficiently massive to explode as a type II supernova.
doc	Hidden orbital currents and spin gap in the heavy fermion superconductor URu _EQN_ Si _EQN_ EOS We have performed neutron scattering experiments on the heavy fermion superconductor URu _EQN_ Si _EQN_ to search for the orbital currents predicted to exist in the ordered phase below \Tn = 17.5 K. EOS Elastic scans in the (H, K, 0) and (H, 0, L) planes revealed no such order parameter at low temperatures. EOS This does not completely rule out orbital current formation, because our detection limit for a ring of scattering is 0.06(1) \ub, which is greater than the size of the predicted moment of ~0.02 \ub. EOS However, on heating, a ring of quasielastic scattering does exist in the (H, K, 0) plane centered at the (1, 0, 0) antiferromagnetic Bragg position and of incommensurate radius _EQN_ = 0.4 r.l.u.. EOS The intensity of this ring is thermally activated below \Tn with a characteristic energy scale of _EQN_ = 110 K: the coherence temperature. EOS We believe that these incommensurate spin fluctuations compete with the AF spin fluctuations, and drive the transition to a disordered magnetic state above \Tn.	The significance of this higher energy scale with respect to \Tn suggests that these fluctuations also play a crucial role in the formation of the heavy fermion state.
doc	Generalization and Expressivity for Deep Nets EOS Along with the rapid development of deep learning in practice, the theoretical explanations for its success become urgent. EOS Generalization and expressivity are two widely used measurements to quantify theoretical behaviors of deep learning. EOS The expressivity focuses on finding functions expressible by deep nets but cannot be approximated by shallow nets with the similar number of neurons. EOS It usually implies the large capacity. EOS The generalization aims at deriving fast learning rate for deep nets. EOS It usually requires small capacity to reduce the variance. EOS Different from previous studies on deep learning, pursuing either expressivity or generalization, we take both factors into account to explore the theoretical advantages of deep nets. EOS For this purpose, we construct a deep net with two hidden layers possessing excellent expressivity in terms of localized and sparse approximation. EOS Then, utilizing the well known covering number to measure the capacity, we find that deep nets possess excellent expressive power (measured by localized and sparse approximation) without enlarging the capacity of shallow nets.	As a consequence, we derive near optimal learning rates for implementing empirical risk minimization (ERM) on the constructed deep nets.
doc	Monte Carlo simulations of proteins in cages: influence of confinement on the stability of intermediate states EOS We present a theoretical study of the folding of small proteins inside confining potentials. EOS Proteins are described in the framework of an effective potential model which contains the Ramachandran angles as degrees of freedom and does not need any a priori information about the native state. EOS Hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole- and hydrophobic interactions are taken explicitly into account. EOS An interesting feature displayed by this potential is the presence of some intermediates between the unfolded and native states. EOS We consider different types of confining potentials in order to study the structural properties of proteins folding inside cages with repulsive or attractive walls. EOS Using the Wang-Landau algorithm we determine the density of states (DOS) and analyze in detail the thermodynamical properties of the confined proteins for different sizes of the cages. EOS We show that confinement dramatically reduces the phase space available to the protein and that the presence of intermediate states can be controlled by varying the properties of the confining potential.	Cages with strongly attractive walls lead to the disappearance of the intermediate states and to a two-state folding into a less stable configuration.
doc	Enforced Development Of The Earth's Atmosphere EOS We review some basic issues of the life-prescribed development of the Earth's system and the Earth's atmosphere and discourse the unity of Earth's type of life in physical and transcendental divisions. EOS In physical division, we exemplify and substantiate the origin of atmospheric phenomena in the metabolic pathways acquired by the Earth's life forms. EOS We are especially concerned with emergence of pro-life superficial environments under elaboration of the energy transformations.	Analysis of the coupling phenomena of elaborated ozone-oxygen transformation and Arctic bromine explosion is provided.
doc	Design of Provably Physical-Constraint-Preserving Methods for General Relativistic Hydrodynamics EOS The paper develops high-order physical-constraint-preserving (PCP) methods for general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) equations, equipped with a general equation of state. EOS Here the physical constraints, describing the admissible states of GRHD, are referred to the subluminal constraint on the fluid velocity and the positivity of the density, pressure and specific internal energy. EOS Preserving these constraints is very important for robust computations, otherwise violating one of them will lead to the ill-posed problem and numerical instability. EOS To overcome the difficulties arising from the inherent strong nonlinearity contained in the constraints, we derive an equivalent definition of the admissible states. EOS Using this definition, we prove the convexity, scaling invariance and Lax-Friedrichs (LxF) splitting property of the admissible state set _EQN_, and discover the dependence of _EQN_ on the spacetime metric. EOS Unfortunately, such dependence yields the non-equivalence of _EQN_ at different points in curved spacetime, and invalidates the convexity of _EQN_ in analyzing PCP schemes. EOS This obstacle is effectively overcame by introducing a new formulation of the GRHD equations.	Based on this formulation and the above theories, a first-order LxF scheme is designed on general unstructured mesh and rigorously proved to be PCP under a CFL condition.
doc	On the phase diagram of the Higgs SU(2) model EOS The Higgs SU(2) model with fixed Higgs length is usually believed to have two different phases at high gauge coupling (\beta), separated by a line of first order transitions but not distinuguished by any typical symmetry associated with a local order parameter, as first proved by Fradkin and Shenker.	We show that in regions of the parameter space where it is usually supposed to be a first order phase transition only a smooth crossover is in fact present.
doc	Theories of Matter: Infinities and Renormalization EOS This paper looks at the theory underlying the science of materials from the perspectives of physics, the history of science, and the philosophy of science. EOS We are particularly concerned with the development of understanding of the thermodynamic phases of matter. EOS The question is how can matter, ordinary matter, support a diversity of forms. EOS We see this diversity each time we observe ice in contact with liquid water or see water vapor (steam) rise from a pot of heated water.	The nature of the phases is brought into the sharpest focus in phase transitions: abrupt changes from one phase to another and hence changes from one behavior to another.

Using near-infrared imaging from the \textit Hubble Space Telescope we classify potential mergers involving massive (_EQN_) cluster members by eye, based on morphological properties such as tidal distortions, double nuclei, and projected near neighbors within 20 kpc.

EOS The leading term is the standard Bekenstein-Hawking area law and sub-leading term corresponds to first quantum corrections in black hole entropy. EOS We also investigate the corrections to entanglement entropy for massive fermion fields in BTZ space-time.	The mass term does not affect the area law.

EOS 250 kg of ultra pure NaI(Tl) crystals will be used as target, divided into 20 modules, 12.5 kg mass each, and coupled to two high efficiency photomultiplier tubes from Hamamatsu. EOS The ANAIS-25 set-up at the LSC consists of two prototypes, amounting 25 kg NaI(Tl), grown from a powder having a potassium level under the limit of our analytical techniques, and installed in a convenient shielding at the LSC. EOS The background has been carefully analyzed and main results will be summarized in this paper, focusing on the alpha contamination identified in the prototypes and the related background contributions.	Status of fulfillment of ANAIS experimental goals and prospects for the building of ANAIS-250 experiment will be also revised.
doc	Curing Braess' Paradox by Secondary Control in Power Grids EOS Robust operation of power transmission grids is essential for most of today's technical infrastructure and our daily life. EOS Adding renewable generation to power grids requires grid extensions and sophisticated control actions on different time scales to cope with short-term fluctuations and long-term power imbalance.	Braess' paradox constitutes a counterintuitive collective phenomenon that occurs if adding new transmission line capacity to a network increases loads on other lines, effectively reducing the system's performance and potentially even entirely removing its operating state.
doc	An Inverse-Problem Approach to Designing Photonic Crystals for Cavity QED Experiments EOS Photonic band gap (PBG) materials are attractive for cavity QED experiments because they provide extremely small mode volumes and are monolithic, integratable structures. EOS As such, PBG cavities are a promising alternative to Fabry-Perot resonators. EOS However, the cavity requirements imposed by QED experiments, such as the need for high Q (low cavity damping) and small mode volumes, present significant design challenges for photonic band gap materials. EOS Here, we pose the PBG design problem as a mathematical inversion and provide an analytical solution for a two-dimensional crystal.	We then address a planar (2D crystal with finite thickness) structure using numerical techniques.

doc	End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lane Keeping Assist EOS Reinforcement learning is considered to be a strong AI paradigm which can be used to teach machines through interaction with the environment and learning from their mistakes, but it has not yet been successfully used for automotive applications. EOS There has recently been a revival of interest in the topic, however, driven by the ability of deep learning algorithms to learn good representations of the environment. EOS Motivated by Google DeepMind's successful demonstrations of learning for games from Breakout to Go, we will propose different methods for autonomous driving using deep reinforcement learning. EOS This is of particular interest as it is difficult to pose autonomous driving as a supervised learning problem as it has a strong interaction with the environment including other vehicles, pedestrians and roadworks. EOS As this is a relatively new area of research for autonomous driving, we will formulate two main categories of algorithms: 1) Discrete actions category, and 2) Continuous actions category. EOS For the discrete actions category, we will deal with Deep Q-Network Algorithm (DQN) while for the continuous actions category, we will deal with Deep Deterministic Actor Critic Algorithm (DDAC).	In addition to that, We will also discover the performance of these two categories on an open source car simulator for Racing called (TORCS) which stands for The Open Racing car Simulator.

EOS Special attention is paid to the case of an imbalanced mixture. EOS We take into account the presence of an underlying harmonic trap, both in a local density approximation and by performing full Real-Space DMFT calculations. EOS We consider the case that the particle density in the trap center is at half filling, leading to an antiferromagnetic region in the center, surrounded by a Fermi liquid region at the edge. EOS In the case of an imbalanced mixture, the antiferromagnetism is directed perpendicular to the ferromagnetic polarization and canted.	We pay special attention to the boundary structure between the antiferromagnetic and the Fermi liquid phase.

doc	Thermodynamics of superconducting lattice fermions EOS We consider the Cooper-problem on a lattice model including onsite and near-neighbor interactions. EOS Expanding the interaction in basis functions for the irreducible representation for the point group _EQN_ yields a classification of the symmetry of the Cooper-pair wave function, which we calculate in real-space. EOS A change of symmetry upon doping, from s-wave at low filling fractions, to _EQN_ at higher filling fractions, is found. EOS Fermi-surface details are thus important for the symmetry of the superconducting wave function. EOS Symmetry forbids mixing of s-wave and d-wave symmetry in the Cooper-pair wavefunction on a square lattice, unless accidental degeneracies occur.	This conclusion also holds for the selfconsistent treatment of the many-body problem, at the critical temperature _EQN_.
doc	Predicting job-hopping likelihood using answers to open-ended interview questions EOS Voluntary employee turnover incurs significant direct and indirect financial costs to organizations of all sizes. EOS A large proportion of voluntary turnover includes people who frequently move from job to job, known as job-hopping. EOS The ability to discover an applicant's likelihood towards job-hopping can help organizations make informed hiring decisions benefiting both parties.	In this work, we show that the language one uses when responding to interview questions related to situational judgment and past behaviour is predictive of their likelihood to job hop.
doc	Efficient algorithms for solving the spectral scattering problems\\ for the Manakov system of nonlinear Schroedinger equations EOS ``Vectorial'' numerical algorithms are proposed for solving the inverse and direct spectral scattering problems for the nonlinear vector Schroedinger equation, taking into account wave polarization, known as the Manakov system. EOS It is shown that a new algebraic group of 4-block matrices with off-diagonal blocks consisting of special vector-like matrices makes possible the generalization of numerical algorithms of the scalar problem to the vector case, both for the focusing and defocusing Manakov systems. EOS As in the scalar case, the solution of the inverse scattering problem consists of inversion of matrices of the discretized system of Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko integral equations using the Toeplitz Inner Bordering algorithm of Levinson's type. EOS Also similar to the scalar case, the algorithm for solving the direct scattering problem obtained by inversion of steps of the algorithm for the inverse scattering problem.	Testing of the vector algorithms performed by comparing the results of the calculations with the known exact analytical solution (the Manakov vector soliton) confirmed the numerical efficiency of the vector algorithms.
doc	Photonic Delay Systems as Machine Learning Implementations EOS Nonlinear photonic delay systems present interesting implementation platforms for machine learning models. EOS They can be extremely fast, offer great degrees of parallelism and potentially consume far less power than digital processors. EOS So far they have been successfully employed for signal processing using the Reservoir Computing paradigm. EOS In this paper we show that their range of applicability can be greatly extended if we use gradient descent with backpropagation through time on a model of the system to optimize the input encoding of such systems. EOS We perform physical experiments that demonstrate that the obtained input encodings work well in reality, and we show that optimized systems perform significantly better than the common Reservoir Computing approach.	The results presented here demonstrate that common gradient descent techniques from machine learning may well be applicable on physical neuro-inspired analog computers.

doc	ROAM: a Radial-basis-function Optimization Approximation Method for diagnosing the three-dimensional coronal magnetic field EOS The Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP) routinely performs coronal polarimetric measurements using the Fe XIII 10747 _EQN_ and 10798 _EQN_ lines, which are sensitive to the coronal magnetic field. EOS However, inverting such polarimetric measurements into magnetic field data is a difficult task because the corona is optically thin at these wavelengths and the observed signal is therefore the integrated emission of all the plasma along the line of sight. EOS To overcome this difficulty, we take on a new approach that combines a parameterized 3D magnetic field model with forward modeling of the polarization signal.	For that purpose, we develop a new, fast and efficient, optimization method for model-data fitting: the Radial-basis-functions Optimization Approximation Method (ROAM).

doc	The mass and angular momentum distribution of simulated massive early-type galaxies to large radii EOS We study the dark and luminous mass distributions, circular velocity curves (CVC), line-of-sight kinematics, and angular momenta for a sample of 42 cosmological zoom simulations of massive galaxies. EOS Using a temporal smoothing technique, we are able to reach large radii. EOS We find that: (i)The dark matter halo density profiles outside a few kpc follow simple power-law models, with flat dark matter CVCs for lower-mass systems, and rising CVCs for high-mass haloes. EOS The projected stellar density distributions at large radii can be fitted by Sersic functions with n>10, larger than for typical ETGs. EOS (ii)The massive systems have nearly flat total CVCs at large radii, while the less massive systems have mildly decreasing CVCs. EOS The slope of the CVC at large radii correlates with v_circ itself. EOS (iii)The dark matter fractions within Re are in the range 15-30% and increase to 40-65% at 5Re. EOS Larger and more massive galaxies have higher dark matter fractions. EOS (iv)The short axes of simulated galaxies and their host dark matter haloes are well aligned and their short-to-long axis ratios are correlated. EOS (v)The stellar vrms(R) profiles are slowly declining, in agreement with planetary nebulae observations in the outer haloes of most ETGs. EOS (vi)The line-of-sight velocity fields v show that rotation properties at small and large radii are correlated. EOS Most radial profiles for the cumulative specific angular momentum parameter lambda(R) are nearly flat or slightly rising, with values in [0.06,0.75] from 2Re to 5Re. EOS (vii)Stellar mass, ellipticity at 5Re, and lambda(5Re) are correlated: the more massive systems have less angular momentum and are rounder, as for observed ETGs. EOS (viii)More massive galaxies with a large fraction of accreted stars have radially anisotropic velocity distributions outside Re.	Tangential anisotropy is seen only for galaxies with high fraction of in-situ stars.
doc	Using Association Rules for Better Treatment of Missing Values EOS The quality of training data for knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining depends upon many factors, but handling missing values is considered to be a crucial factor in overall data quality. EOS Today real world datasets contains missing values due to human, operational error, hardware malfunctioning and many other factors. EOS The quality of knowledge extracted, learning and decision problems depend directly upon the quality of training data.	By considering the importance of handling missing values in KDD and data mining tasks, in this paper we propose a novel Hybrid Missing values Imputation Technique (HMiT) using association rules mining and hybrid combination of k-nearest neighbor approach.
doc	Revisiting the radial abundance gradients of nitrogen and oxygen of the Milky Way EOS We present spectra obtained with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias telescope of 13 Galactic HII regions, most of them of very low ionisation degree. EOS The objects are located along the Galactic disc, with R_G from 5.7 to 16.1 kpc. EOS We determine T_e([NII]) for all of them. EOS We obtain - for the first time - a radial abundance gradient of N that is independent on the ionisation correction factor. EOS The radial distribution of the N/O ratio is almost flat, indicating that the bulk of N is not formed by standard secondary processes. EOS We have made a reassessment of the radial O abundance gradient combining our results with previous similar ones by Esteban et al (2017); EOS producing a homogeneous dataset of 35 HII regions with direct determinations of the electron temperature.	We report the possible presence of a flattening or drop of the O abundance in the inner part of the Galactic disc.
doc	On the base _EQN_ expansion of the number of trailing zeroes of _EQN_ EOS Let us denote by _EQN_ the number of trailing zeroes in the base b expansion of _EQN_. EOS In this paper we study the connection between the expression of _EQN_ in base _EQN_, and that of _EQN_. EOS In particular, if _EQN_ is a prime power, we will show the equality between the _EQN_ digits of _EQN_ and the first _EQN_ digits in the fractional part of _EQN_.	In the general case we will see that this equality still holds except for, at most, the last _EQN_ digits.
doc	The boundary Riemann solver coming from the real vanishing viscosity approximation EOS We study a family of initial boundary value problems associated to mixed hyperbolic-parabolic systems: v^ \epsilon _t + A (v^ \epsilon, \epsilon v^ \epsilon _x) v^ \epsilon _x = \epsilon B (v^ \epsilon) v^ \epsilon _ xx The conservative case is, in particular, included in the previous formulation. EOS We suppose that the solutions _EQN_ to these problems converge to a unique limit. EOS Also, it is assumed smallness of the total variation and other technical hypotheses and it is provided a complete characterization of the limit. EOS The most interesting points are the following two. EOS First, the boundary characteristic case is considered, i.e.	one eigenvalue of _EQN_ can be _EQN_.
doc	Interpreting and using CPDAGs with background knowledge EOS We develop terminology and methods for working with maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graphs (maximal PDAGs). EOS Maximal PDAGs arise from imposing restrictions on a Markov equivalence class of directed acyclic graphs, or equivalently on its graphical representation as a completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG), for example when adding background knowledge about certain edge orientations. EOS Although maximal PDAGs often arise in practice, causal methods have been mostly developed for CPDAGs. EOS In this paper, we extend such methodology to maximal PDAGs. EOS In particular, we develop methodology to read off possible ancestral relationships, we introduce a graphical criterion for covariate adjustment to estimate total causal effects, and we adapt the IDA and joint-IDA frameworks to estimate multi-sets of possible causal effects. EOS We also present a simulation study that illustrates the gain in identifiability of total causal effects as the background knowledge increases.	All methods are implemented in the R package pcalg.

doc	Universal Transport Dynamics of Complex Fluids EOS Thermal motion in complex fluids is a complicated stochastic process but ubiquitously exhibits initial ballistic, intermediate sub-diffusive, and long-time non-Gaussian diffusive motion, unless interrupted. EOS Despite its relevance to numerous dynamical processes of interest in modern science, a unified, quantitative understanding of thermal motion in complex fluids remains a long-standing problem. EOS Here, we present a new transport equation and its solutions, which yield a unified quantitative explanation of the mean square displacement (MSD) and the non-Gaussian parameter (NGP) of various fluid systems. EOS We find the environment-coupled diffusion kernel and its time correlation function are two essential quantities determining transport dynamics of complex fluids. EOS From our analysis, we construct a general, explicit model of the complex fluid transport dynamics. EOS This model quantitatively explains not only the MSD and NGP, but also the time-dependent relaxation of the displacement distribution for various systems.	We introduce the concepts of intrinsic disorder and extrinsic disorder that have distinct effects on transport dynamics and different dependencies on temperature and density.
doc	An integrated approach to simulating the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque EOS Analyses of individual atherosclerotic plaques are mostly descriptive, relying -- for example -- on histological classification by spectral analysis of ultrasound waves or staining and observing particular cellular components.	Such passive methods have proved useful for characterizing the structure and vulnerability of plaques but have little quantitative predictive power.
doc	Partially-Latent Class Models (pLCM) for Case-Control Studies of Childhood Pneumonia Etiology EOS In population studies on the etiology of disease, one goal is the estimation of the fraction of cases attributable to each of several causes. EOS For example, pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis of lung infection that may be caused by viral, bacterial, fungal, or other pathogens. EOS The study of pneumonia etiology is challenging because directly sampling from the lung to identify the etiologic pathogen is not standard clinical practice in most settings. EOS Instead, measurements from multiple peripheral specimens are made. EOS This paper introduces the statistical methodology designed for estimating the population etiology distribution and the individual etiology probabilities in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study of 9; EOS 500 children for 7 sites around the world. EOS We formulate the scientific problem in statistical terms as estimating the mixing weights and latent class indicators under a partially-latent class model (pLCM) that combines heterogeneous measurements with different error rates obtained from a case-control study. EOS We introduce the pLCM as an extension of the latent class model. EOS We also introduce graphical displays of the population data and inferred latent-class frequencies.	The methods are tested with simulated data, and then applied to PERCH data.

doc	Dark matter halo abundances, clustering and assembly histories at high redshift EOS We use a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations to study the properties, abundance and clustering of high mass halos at high redshift, including their mass assembly histories and mergers. EOS We find that the analytic form which best fits the abundance of halos depends sensitively on the assumed definition of halo mass, with common definitions of halo mass differing by a factor of two for these low concentration, massive halos.	A significant number of massive halos are undergoing rapid mass accretion, with major merger activity being common.
doc	X-ray Absorption in Young Core-Collapse Supernova Remnants EOS The material expelled by core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions absorbs X-rays from the central regions. EOS We use SN models based on three-dimensional neutrino-driven explosions to estimate optical depths to the center of the explosion, compare different progenitor models, and investigate the effects of explosion asymmetries. EOS The optical depths below 2 keV for progenitors with a remaining hydrogen envelope are expected to be high during the first century after the explosion due to photoabsorption. EOS A typical optical depth is _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the time since the explosion in units of 10 000 days (_EQN_ 27 years) and _EQN_ the energy in units of keV. EOS Compton scattering dominates above 50 keV, but the scattering depth is lower and reaches unity already at _EQN_ 1000 days at 1 MeV. EOS The optical depths are approximately an order of magnitude lower for hydrogen-stripped progenitors.	The metallicity of the SN ejecta is much higher than in the interstellar medium, which enhances photoabsorption and makes absorption edges stronger.
doc	Principal stratification analysis using principal scores EOS Practitioners are interested in not only the average causal effect of the treatment on the outcome but also the underlying causal mechanism in the presence of an intermediate variable between the treatment and outcome. EOS However, in many cases we cannot randomize the intermediate variable, resulting in sample selection problems even in randomized experiments. EOS Therefore, we view randomized experiments with intermediate variables as semi-observational studies. EOS In parallel with the analysis of observational studies, we provide a theoretical foundation for conducting objective causal inference with an intermediate variable under the principal stratification framework, with principal strata defined as the joint potential values of the intermediate variable. EOS Our strategy constructs weighted samples based on principal scores, defined as the conditional probabilities of the latent principal strata given covariates, without access to any outcome data.	This principal stratification analysis yields robust causal inference without relying on any model assumptions on the outcome distributions.

High-energy view with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR EOS We present the analysis of five joint XMM-Newton/NuSTAR observations, 20 ks each and separated by 12 days, of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 382. EOS The data were obtained as part of a campaign performed in September-October 2016 simultaneously with VLBA.	The radio data and their relation with the X-ray ones will be discussed in a following paper.

doc	Exoplanet characterisation in the longest known resonant chain: the K2-138 system seen by HARPS EOS The detection of low-mass transiting exoplanets in multiple systems brings new constraints to planetary formation and evolution processes and challenges the current planet formation theories. EOS Nevertheless, only a mere fraction of the small planets detected by Kepler and K2 have precise mass measurements, which are mandatory to constrain their composition. EOS We aim to characterise the planets that orbit the relatively bright star K2-138. EOS This system is dynamically particular as it presents the longest chain known to date of planets close to the 3:2 resonance.	We obtained 215 HARPS spectra from which we derived the radial-velocity variations of K2-138.

doc	Inclusive cross section and single-transverse-spin asymmetry for very forward neutron production in polarized p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV EOS The energy dependence of the single-transverse-spin asymmetry, A_N, and the cross section for neutron production at very forward angles were measured in the PHENIX experiment at RHIC for polarized p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV. EOS The neutrons were observed in forward detectors covering an angular range of up to 2.2 mrad. EOS We report results for neutrons with momentum fraction of x_F=0.45 to 1.0. EOS The energy dependence of the measured cross sections were consistent with x_F scaling, compared to measurements by an ISR experiment which measured neutron production in unpolarized p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=30.6--62.7 GeV. EOS The cross sections for large x_F neutron production for p+p collisions, as well as those in e+p collisions measured at HERA, are described by a pion exchange mechanism. EOS The observed forward neutron asymmetries were large, reaching A_N=-0.08+/-0.02 for x_F=0.8; EOS the measured backward asymmetries, for negative x_F, were consistent with zero.	The observed asymmetry for forward neutron production is discussed within the pion exchange framework, with interference between the spin-flip amplitude due to the pion exchange and nonflip amplitudes from all Reggeon exchanges.
doc	Stable, low-error and calibration-free polarization encoder for free-space quantum communication EOS Polarization-encoded free-space Quantum Communication requires a quantum state source featuring fast polarization modulation, long-term stability and a low intrinsic error rate. EOS Here we present a source based on a Sagnac interferometer and composed of polarization maintaining fibers, a fiber polarization beam splitter and an electro-optic phase modulator. EOS The system generates predetermined polarization states with a fixed reference frame in free-space that does not require calibration neither at the transmitter nor at the receiver.	In this way we achieve long-term stability and low error rates.

doc	Shining X-rays on asymptotically safe quantum gravity EOS Asymptotically safe quantum gravity is a promising candidate scenario to provide a UV extension for the effective quantum field theory of Einstein's gravity.

However, observational tests of asymptotically safe quantum gravity are more challenging.

doc	On zero-sum _EQN_ -magic graphs EOS Let _EQN_ be a finite graph and let _EQN_ be an abelian group with identity 0. EOS Then _EQN_ is \textit _EQN_ -magic if and only if there exists a function _EQN_ from _EQN_ into _EQN_ such that for some _EQN_, _EQN_ for every _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the set of edges incident to _EQN_. EOS Additionally, _EQN_ is \textit zero-sum _EQN_ -magic if and only if _EQN_ exists such that _EQN_. EOS We consider zero-sum _EQN_ -magic labelings of graphs, with particular attention given to _EQN_. EOS For _EQN_, let _EQN_ be the smallest positive integer _EQN_ such that _EQN_ is zero-sum _EQN_ -magic if _EQN_ exists; EOS infinity otherwise. EOS We establish upper bounds on _EQN_ when _EQN_ is finite, and show that _EQN_ is finite for all _EQN_ -regular _EQN_, _EQN_.	Appealing to classical results on the factors of cubic graphs, we prove that _EQN_ for a cubic graph _EQN_, with equality if and only if _EQN_ has no 1-factor.
doc	Nineteenth century air pollution variations in Paris inferred from Eiffel Tower potential gradient measurements EOS Early surface measurements of atmospheric Potential Gradient were made in many European cities in the nineteenth century (C19th). EOS The data was usually obtained at hourly resolution, and good accounts of the calibration of the instruments are also often available. EOS The PG measurements made by Chauveau on the Eiffel Tower, soon after its completion in the 1890s, are particularly notable. EOS Atmospheric electrical proxy techniques in combination with simple boundary layer meteorology are used to determine air pollution levels.	The C19th PG measurements in both polluted and clean Parisian air present a unique resource for European air pollution and atmospheric composition studies.
doc	KFe_2Se_2 is the parent compound of K-doped iron selenide superconductors EOS We elucidate the existing controversies in the newly discovered K-doped iron selenide (KxFe2-ySe2-z) superconductors. EOS The stoichiometric KFe2Se2 with \surd2\times\surd2 charge ordering was identified as the parent compound of KxFe2-ySe2-z superconductor using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy.	The superconductivity is induced in KFe2Se2 by either Se vacancies or interacting with the anti-ferromagnetic K2Fe4Se5 compound.
doc	FSRQ/BL Lac dichotomy as the magnetized advective accretion process around black holes: a unified classification of blazars EOS The _EQN_ blazar observations show a strong correlation between _EQN_ -ray luminosities and spectral indices. EOS BL Lac objects are less luminous with harder spectra than flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). EOS Interestingly FSRQs are evident to exhibit a Keplerian disc component along with a powerful jet. EOS We compute the jet intrinsic luminosities by beaming corrections determined by different cooling mechanisms. EOS Observed _EQN_ -ray luminosities and spectroscopic measurements of broad emission lines suggest a correlation of the accretion disc luminosity with jet intrinsic luminosity. EOS Also, theoretical and observational inferences for these jetted sources indicate a signature of hot advective accretion flow and a dynamically dominant magnetic field at jet-footprint. EOS Indeed it is difficult to imagine the powerful jet launching from a geometrically thin Keplerian disc.	We propose a magnetized, advective disc-outflow symbiosis with explicit cooling to address a unified classification of blazars by controlling both the mass accretion rate and magnetic field strength.
doc	QCD at imaginary chemical potential with Wilson fermions EOS We investigate the phase diagram in the temperature, imaginary chemical potential plane for QCD with three degenerate quark flavors using Wilson type fermions. EOS While more expensive than the staggered fermions used in past studies in this area, Wilson fermions can be used safely to simulate systems with three quark flavors. EOS In this talk, we focus on the (pseudo)critical line that extends from _EQN_ in the imaginary chemical potential plane, trace it to the Roberge-Weiss line, and determine its location relative to the Roberge-Weiss transition point. EOS In order to smoothly follow the (pseudo)critical line in this plane we perform a multi-histogram reweighting in both temperature and chemical potential. EOS To perform reweighting in the chemical potential we use the compression formula to compute the determinants exactly.	Our results are compatible with the standard scenario.

doc	Imaging of Alignment, Deformation and Dissociation of CS2 Molecules using Ultrafast Electron Diffraction EOS Imaging the structure of molecules in transient excited states remains a challenge due to the extreme requirements for spatial and temporal resolution. EOS Ultrafast electron diffraction from aligned molecules (UEDAM) provides atomic resolution and allows for the retrieval of structural information without the need to rely on theoretical models. EOS Here we use UEDAM and femtosecond laser mass spectrometry (FLMS) to investigate the dynamics in carbon disulfide (CS2) following the interaction with an intense femtosecond laser pulse.	We have retrieved images of ground state and excited molecules with 0.03 \AA precision.
doc	Discovery of Reflection Nebulosity Around Five Vega-like Stars EOS Coronagraphic optical observations of six Vega-like stars reveal reflection nebulosities, five of which were previously unknown. EOS The nebulosities illuminated by HD 4881, HD 23362, HD 23680, HD 26676, and HD 49662 resemble that of the Pleiades, indicating an interstellar origin for dust grains. EOS The reflection nebulosity around HD 123160 has a double-arm morphology, but no disk-like feature is seen as close as 2.5 arcsec from the star in K-band adaptive optics data.	We demonstrate that uniform density dust clouds surrounding HD 23362, HD 23680 and HD 123160 can account for the observed 12-100 micron spectral energy distributions.
doc	Entropy Bound of Horizons for Accelerating, Rotating and Charged Plebanski-Demianski Black Hole EOS We first review the accelerating, rotating and charged Plebanski-Demianski (PD) black hole, which includes the Kerr-Newman rotating black hole and the Taub-NUT spacetime. EOS The main feature of this black hole is that it has 4 horizons like event horizon, Cauchy horizon and two accelerating horizons. EOS In the non-extremal case, the surface area, entropy, surface gravity, temperature, angular velocity, Komar energy and irreducible mass on the event horizon and Cauchy horizon are presented for PD black hole. EOS The entropy product, temperature product, Komar energy product and irreducible mass product are found for event horizon and Cauchy horizon. EOS Also their sums are also found for both horizons. EOS All these relations are found to be depend on mass of the PD black hole and other parameters.	So all the products are not universal for PD black hole.

doc	Thermal fluctuations and flux-tunable barrier in proximity Josephson junctions EOS The effect of thermal fluctuations in Josephson junctions is usually analysed using the Ambegaokar-Halperin (AH) theory in the context of thermal activation. EOS "Enhanced" fluctuations, demonstrated by broadening of current-voltage characteristics, have previously been found for proximity Josephson junctions. EOS Here we report measurements of micron-scale normal metal loops contacted with thin superconducting electrodes, where the unconventional loop geometry enables tuning of the junction barrier with applied flux; EOS for some geometries, the barrier can be effectively eliminated. EOS Stronger fluctuations are observed when the flux threading the normal metal loop is near an odd half-integer flux quantum, and for devices with thinner superconducting electrodes. EOS These findings suggest that the activation barrier, which is the Josephson coupling energy of the proximity junction, is different from that of conventional Josephson junctions. EOS Simple one dimensional quasiclassical theory can predict the interference effect due to the loop structure, but the exact magnitude of the coupling energy cannot be computed without taking into account the details of the sample dimensions.	In this way, the physics of this system is similar to the phase slipping process in thin superconducting wires.
doc	Numerical Convergence of Discrete Exterior Calculus on Arbitrary Surface Meshes EOS Discrete exterior calculus (DEC) is a structure-preserving numerical framework for partial differential equations solution, particularly suitable for simplicial meshes. EOS A longstanding and widespread assumption has been that DEC requires special (Delaunay) triangulations, which complicated the mesh generation process especially on curved surfaces. EOS This paper presents numerical evidences demonstrating that this restriction is unnecessary. EOS Convergence experiments are carried out for various physical problems using both Delaunay and non-Delaunay triangulations.	Signed diagonal definition for the key DEC operator (Hodge star) is adopted.
doc	Color Superfluid and Trionic State of Attractive Three-Component Lattice Fermionic Atoms at Finite Temperatures EOS We investigate the finite-temperature properties of attractive three-component (colors) fermionic atoms in optical lattices using a self-energy functional approach.

In the strong attractive region, a first-order transition occurs from a CSF to a trionic state.
doc	From Ohmic to Ballistic Transport in Oriented Graphite EOS In this work we show that for a quasi-2D system of size _EQN_ and thickness _EQN_ the resistance goes as _EQN_, diverging logarithmically with the size.

Furthermore, we present an experimental method that allows us to obtain the carriers mean free path _EQN_, the Fermi wavelength _EQN_ and the mobility _EQN_ directly from experiments without adjustable parameters.

doc	High-resolution imaging and spectroscopy in the visible from large ground-based telescopes with natural guide stars EOS Near-diffraction limited imaging and spectroscopy in the visible on large (8-10 meter) class telescopes has proved to be beyond the capabilities of current adaptive optics technologies, even when using laser guide stars. EOS The need for high resolution visible imaging in any part of the sky suggests that a rather different approach is needed. EOS This paper describes the results of simulations, experiments and astronomical observations that show that a combination of low order adaptive optic correction using a 4-field curvature sensor and fast Lucky Imaging strategies with a photon counting CCD camera systems should deliver 20-25 milliarcsecond resolution in the visible with reference stars as faint as 18.5 magnitude in I band on large telescopes.	Such an instrument may be used to feed an integral field spectrograph efficiently using configurations that will also be described.

EOS After a review of the existing methods, a new approach, which considers the three characteristic thruster dimensions, i.e. EOS the channel length, the channel width and the channel mean diameter as well as the magnetic field, is introduced. EOS This approach is based on analytical laws deduced from the physical principles that govern the properties of a Hall effect thruster, relying on a list of simplifying assumptions.	In addition, constraints on the channel wall temperature as well as on the propellant atom density inside the channel are taken into account.
doc	Understanding IoT Security Through the Data Crystal Ball: Where We Are Now and Where We Are Going to Be EOS Inspired by the boom of the consumer IoT market, many device manufacturers, start-up companies and technology giants have jumped into the space. EOS Unfortunately, the exciting utility and rapid marketization of IoT, come at the expense of privacy and security. EOS Industry reports and academic work have revealed many attacks on IoT systems, resulting in privacy leakage, property loss and large-scale availability problems. EOS To mitigate such threats, a few solutions have been proposed. EOS However, it is still less clear what are the impacts they can have on the IoT ecosystem. EOS In this work, we aim to perform a comprehensive study on reported attacks and defenses in the realm of IoT aiming to find out what we know, where the current studies fall short and how to move forward. EOS To this end, we first build a toolkit that searches through massive amount of online data using semantic analysis to identify over 3000 IoT-related articles. EOS Further, by clustering such collected data using machine learning technologies, we are able to compare academic views with the findings from industry and other sources, in an attempt to understand the gaps between them, the trend of the IoT security risks and new problems that need further attention. EOS We systemize this process, by proposing a taxonomy for the IoT ecosystem and organizing IoT security into five problem areas.	We use this taxonomy as a beacon to assess each IoT work across a number of properties we define.

doc	Effects of Structural Distortions on the Electronic Structure of T-type Transition Metal Dichalcogenides EOS Single-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can adopt two distinct structures corresponding to different coordination of the metal atoms. EOS TMDCs adopting the T-type structure exhibit a rich and diverse set of phenomena, including charge density waves (CDW) in a _EQN_ supercell pattern in TaS _EQN_ and TaSe _EQN_, and a possible excitonic insulating phase in TiSe _EQN_. EOS These properties make the T-TMDCs desirable components of layered heterostructure devices.	In order to predict the emergent properties of combinations of different layered materials, one needs simple and accurate models for the constituent layers which can take into account potential effects of lattice mismatch, relaxation, strain, and structural distortion.

EOS We focus on the leading peak of the velocity signal which decreases in a power-law _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the location of the peak, as the signal goes down. EOS The ratio of backscattered to incident leading velocity also follows a power-law _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the depth of impurity. EOS The up-going backscattered signal is nearly solitary.	Therefore, the overall change of the leading velocity peak is given by the power-law _EQN_.
doc	Correlated microtiming deviations in jazz and rock music EOS Musical rhythms performed by humans typically show temporal fluctuations. EOS While they have been characterized in simple rhythmic tasks, it is an open question what is the nature of temporal fluctuations, when several musicians perform music jointly in all its natural complexity. EOS To study such fluctuations in over 100 original jazz and rock/pop recordings played with and without metronome we developed a semi-automated workflow allowing the extraction of cymbal beat onsets with millisecond precision. EOS Analyzing the inter-beat interval (IBI) time series revealed evidence for two long-range correlated processes characterized by power laws in the IBI power spectral densities. EOS One process dominates on short timescales (_EQN_ beats) and reflects microtiming variability in the generation of single beats. EOS The other dominates on longer timescales and reflects slow tempo variations.	Whereas the latter did not show differences between musical genres (jazz vs.

doc	Detecting Sub-lunar Mass Compact Objects toward the Local Group Galaxies EOS By monitoring a large number of stars in the Local Group galaxies, we can detect nanolensing events by sub-lunar mass compact objects (SULCOs) such as primordial black holes (PBHs) and rogue (free-floating) dwarf planets in the Milky Way halo. EOS In contarst to microlensing by stellar-mass objects, the finite-source size effect becomes important and the lensing time duration becomes shorter (_EQN_). EOS Using stars with _EQN_ in M33 as sources, for one-night observation, we would be able to detect _EQN_ nanolensing events caused by SULCOs in the Milky Way halo with a mass of _EQN_ to _EQN_ for sources with S/N _EQN_ if SULCOs constitute all the dark matter components.	Moreover, we expect _EQN_ events in which bright blue stars with S/N _EQN_ are weakly amplified due to lensing by SULCOs with a mass range of _EQN_ to _EQN_.

doc	In-medium bound states of two bosonic impurities in a one-dimensional Fermi gas EOS We investigate the ground-state energy of a one-dimensional Fermi gas with two bosonic impurities. EOS We consider spinless fermions with no fermion-fermion interactions. EOS The fermion-impurity and impurity-impurity interactions are modelled with Dirac delta functions. EOS First, we study the case where impurity and fermions have equal masses, and the impurity-impurity two-body interaction is identical to the fermion-impurity interaction, such that the system is solvable with the Bethe ansatz. EOS For attractive interactions, we find that the energy of the impurity-impurity subsystem is below the energy of the bound state that exists without the Fermi gas. EOS We interpret this as a manifestation of attractive boson-boson interactions induced by the fermionic medium, and refer to the impurity-impurity subsystem as an in-medium bound state. EOS For repulsive interactions, we find no in-medium bound states. EOS Second, we construct an effective model to describe these interactions, and compare its predictions to the exact solution.	We use this effective model to study non-integrable systems with unequal masses and/or potentials.

We give a possible theoretical origin of such values based on the _EQN_ - _EQN_ reflection symmetry.

EOS The practical implementation of this idea requires complete control over all of the 2^n independent amplitudes of a many-particle wavefunction, where n>1000.	The principles of quantum computing are discussed from the practical point of view with the conclusion that no working device will be built in the forseeable future.
doc	Hebbian Synaptic Modifications in Spiking Neurons that Learn EOS In this paper, we derive a new model of synaptic plasticity, based on recent algorithms for reinforcement learning (in which an agent attempts to learn appropriate actions to maximize its long-term average reward). EOS We show that these direct reinforcement learning algorithms also give locally optimal performance for the problem of reinforcement learning with multiple agents, without any explicit communication between agents. EOS By considering a network of spiking neurons as a collection of agents attempting to maximize the long-term average of a reward signal, we derive a synaptic update rule that is qualitatively similar to Hebb's postulate.	This rule requires only simple computations, such as addition and leaky integration, and involves only quantities that are available in the vicinity of the synapse.

doc	Electroweak Baryogenesis in the Adiabatic Limit EOS Electroweak baryogenesis can occur in the ``adiabatic limit,'' in which expanding bubbles of true vacuum are assumed to have rather thick walls and be slowly moving. EOS Here the problem of calculating the baryon asymmetry in this limit is reconsidered. EOS A simple prescription for obtaining the relevant kinetic equations is given. EOS An additional suppression beyond that usually assumed is found.	This arises because the generation of an asymmetry requires violation of approximately conserved currents by Higgs expectation values, which are small near the front of the walls.

doc	Selection from read-only memory with limited workspace EOS Given an unordered array of _EQN_ elements drawn from a totally ordered set and an integer _EQN_ in the range from _EQN_ to _EQN_, in the classic selection problem the task is to find the _EQN_ -th smallest element in the array. EOS We study the complexity of this problem in the space-restricted random-access model: The input array is stored on read-only memory, and the algorithm has access to a limited amount of workspace. EOS We prove that the linear-time prune-and-search algorithm---presented in most textbooks on algorithms---can be modified to use _EQN_ bits instead of _EQN_ words of extra space.	Prior to our work, the best known algorithm by Frederickson could perform the task with _EQN_ bits of extra space in _EQN_ time.
doc	Learning Conditional Random Fields with Augmented Observations for Partially Observed Action Recognition EOS This paper aims at recognizing partially observed human actions in videos. EOS Action videos acquired in uncontrolled environments often contain corrupt frames, which make actions partially observed. EOS Furthermore, these frames can last for arbitrary lengths of time and appear irregularly. EOS They are inconsistent with training data and degrade the performance of pre-trained action recognition systems. EOS We present an approach to address this issue. EOS For each training and testing actions, we divide it into segments and explore the mutual dependency between temporal segments. EOS This property states that the similarity of two actions at one segment often implies their similarity at another. EOS We augment each segment with extra alternatives retrieved from training data.	The augmentation algorithm is designed in a way where a few alternatives are good enough to replace the original segment where corrupt frames occur.
doc	The Three-Dimensional Structure of Interior Ejecta in Cassiopeia A at High Spectral Resolution EOS We used the Spitzer Space Telescope's Infrared Spectrograph to create a high resolution spectral map of the central region of the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant, allowing us to make a Doppler reconstruction of its 3D structure. EOS The ejecta responsible for this emission have not yet encountered the remnant's reverse shock or the circumstellar medium, making it an ideal laboratory for exploring the dynamics of the supernova explosion itself. EOS We observe that the O, Si, and S ejecta can form both sheet-like structures as well as filaments. EOS Si and O, which come from different nucleosynthetic layers of the star, are observed to be coincident in velocity space in some regions, and separated by 500 km/s or more in others. EOS Ejecta traveling toward us are, on average, ~900 km/s slower than the material traveling away from us. EOS We compare our observations to recent supernova explosion models and find that no single model can simultaneously reproduce all the observed features.	However, models of different supernova explosions can collectively produce the observed geometries and structures of the interior emission.

We found different behavior of the energy levels of this potential for three different ranges of the value of _EQN_.
doc	Morphological modification of the technical flax fibre bundles to improve the longitudinal tensile properties of flax fibre reinforced epoxy composites EOS As far as the tensile properties of natural fibres as reinforcements for composites are concerned, flax fibres will stay at the top-end. EOS However, an efficient conversion of fibre properties into their corresponding composite properties has been a challenge, due to the fibre damages done through the conventional textile methods utilised to process flax. EOS These techniques impart disadvantageous features onto fibres at both micro, and mesolevel, which degrade the mechanical performances of flax fibre reinforced composites, FFRC. EOS Undulation of fibre is one of those detrimental features that occur during traditional fibre extraction and fabric manufacturing routes. EOS The undulation or waviness causes micro compressive defects or kink bands in elementary flax fibres, which significantly undermines the performance of FFRC. EOS Manufacturing flax fabric with minimal undulation could diminish the micro compressive defects up to a substantial extent. EOS In this research, nonwoven flax tapes of highly aligned flax fibres, blended with a small proportion of PLA, Polylactic Acid have been manufactured deploying a novel technique.	Composites reinforced from those nonwoven tapes have been compared with composites reinforced with woven Hopsack fabrics and warp knitted unidirectional,UD fabrics from flax that are comprised of undulating fibres.
doc	Switch-based Hybrid Beamforming for Massive MIMO Communications in mmWave Bands EOS Switch-based hybrid network is a promising implementation for beamforming in large-scale millimetre wave (mmWave) antenna arrays. EOS By fully exploiting the sparse nature of the mmWave channel, such hybrid beamforming reduces complexity and power consumption when compared with a structure based on phase shifters. EOS However, the difficulty of designing an optimum beamformer in the analog domain is prohibitive due to the binary nature of such a switch-based structure. EOS Thus, here we propose a new method for designing a switch-based hybrid beamformer for massive MIMO communications in mmWave bands. EOS We first propose a method for decoupling the joint optimization of analog and digital beamformers by confining the problem to a rank-constrained subspace. EOS We then approximate the solution through two approaches: norm maximization (SHD-NM), and majorization (SHD-QRQU). EOS In the norm maximization method, we propose a modified sequential convex programming (SCP) procedure that maximizes the mutual information while addressing the mismatch incurred from approximating the log-determinant by a Frobenius norm. EOS In the second method, we employ a lower bound on the mutual information by QR factorization.	We also introduce linear constraints in order to include frequently-used partially-connected structures.
doc	SlideNet: Fast and Accurate Slide Quality Assessment Based on Deep Neural Networks EOS This work tackles the automatic fine-grained slide quality assessment problem for digitized direct smears test using the Gram staining protocol. EOS Automatic quality assessment can provide useful information for the pathologists and the whole digital pathology workflow. EOS For instance, if the system found a slide to have a low staining quality, it could send a request to the automatic slide preparation system to remake the slide. EOS If the system detects severe damage in the slides, it could notify the experts that manual microscope reading may be required. EOS In order to address the quality assessment problem, we propose a deep neural network based framework to automatically assess the slide quality in a semantic way. EOS Specifically, the first step of our framework is to perform dense fine-grained region classification on the whole slide and calculate the region distribution histogram. EOS Next, our framework will generate assessments of the slide quality from various perspectives: staining quality, information density, damage level and which regions are more valuable for subsequent high-magnification analysis. EOS To make the information more accessible, we present our results in the form of a heat map and text summaries.	Additionally, in order to stimulate research in this direction, we propose a novel dataset for slide quality assessment.

For _EQN_, we find evidence of a phase coherence threshold value _EQN_, below the percolation concentration of diluted junctions _EQN_, where the superconducting transition vanishes.
doc	Heavy quark symmetry and weak decays of the _EQN_ -baryons in pentaquarks with a _EQN_ component EOS The discovery of the baryonic states _EQN_ and _EQN_ by the LHCb collaboration has evoked a lot of theoretical interest. EOS These states have the minimal quark content _EQN_. EOS Interpreted as hidden charm diquark-diquark-antiquark baryons, the assigned spin and angular momentum quantum numbers are _EQN_ and _EQN_, where _EQN_ are the spins of the diquarks and _EQN_ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the pentaquarks.	We point out that heavy quark symmetry allows only the higher mass pentaquark state _EQN_ having _EQN_ to be produced in _EQN_ decays, whereas the lower mass state _EQN_ having _EQN_ is disfavored.
doc	The evolution of binary star clusters and the nature of NGC2136/NGC2137 EOS We study the evolution of bound pairs of star clusters by means of direct N-body simulations. EOS Our simulations include mass loss by stellar evolution. EOS The initial conditions are selected to mimic the observed binary star cluster NGC 2136 and NGC 2137 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. EOS Based on the rather old ages (_EQN_ Myr), masses, sizes of the two clusters and their projected separation, we conclude that the cluster pair must have been born with an initial separation of 15--20 pc. EOS Clusters with a smaller initial separation tend to merge in _EQN_ Myr due to loss of angular momentum from escaping stars.	Clusters with a larger initial separation tend to become even more widely separated due to mass loss from the evolving stellar populations.

EOS Then we shall construct a family of Pogorelov-type examples for complex Monge-Ampere equation.	These examples give generalized entire solutions (as well as viscosity solutions) of complex Monge-Ampere equation _EQN_

doc	The origin of the stabilized simple-cubic structure in Po EOS The origin of the stabilized simple-cubic (SC) structure in Po is explored by using the first principle band calculations. EOS We have found that the prime origin is the inherent strong spin-orbit (SO) interaction in Po, which suppresses the Peierls-like structural instability as usually occurs in p-bonded systems.	Based on the systematic analysis of electronic structures, charge densities, Fermi surfaces, and susceptibilities of Se, Te, and Po, we have proved that the stable crystal structure in VIA elements is determined by the competition between the SO splitting and the crystal field splitting induced by the low-symmetry structural transition.

doc	Quantum statistical query learning EOS We propose a learning model called the quantum statistical learning QSQ model, which extends the SQ learning model introduced by Kearns to the quantum setting. EOS Our model can be also seen as a restriction of the quantum PAC learning model: here, the learner does not have direct access to quantum examples, but can only obtain estimates of measurement statistics on them.	Theoretically, this model provides a simple yet expressive setting to explore the power of quantum examples in machine learning.

In this study, a novel generic approach for uncovering latent preference patterns from user data is proposed and evaluated.

Based on recent studies of wall effects, we introduce a new definition of the spatial operator and illustrate its favorable characteristics.
doc	BONNSAI: correlated stellar observables in Bayesian methods EOS In an era of large spectroscopic surveys of stars and big data, sophisticated statistical methods become more and more important in order to infer fundamental stellar parameters such as mass and age. EOS Bayesian techniques are powerful methods because they can match all available observables simultaneously to stellar models while taking prior knowledge properly into account. EOS However, in most cases it is assumed that observables are uncorrelated which is generally not the case. EOS Here, we include correlations in the Bayesian code BONNSAI by incorporating the covariance matrix in the likelihood function. EOS We derive a parametrisation of the covariance matrix that, in addition to classical uncertainties, only requires the specification of a correlation parameter that describes how observables co-vary. EOS Our correlation parameter depends purely on the method with which observables have been determined and can be analytically derived in some cases. EOS This approach therefore has the advantage that correlations can be accounted for even if information for them are not available in specific cases but are known in general.	Because the new likelihood model is a better approximation of the data, the reliability and robustness of the inferred parameters are improved.
doc	When Machine Learning Meets Big Data: A Wireless Communication Perspective EOS We have witnessed an exponential growth in commercial data services, which has lead to the 'big data era'. EOS Machine learning, as one of the most promising artificial intelligence tools of analyzing the deluge of data, has been invoked in many research areas both in academia and industry. EOS The aim of this article is twin-fold. EOS Firstly, we briefly review big data analysis and machine learning, along with their potential applications in next-generation wireless networks. EOS The second goal is to invoke big data analysis to predict the requirements of mobile users and to exploit it for improving the performance of "social network-aware wireless". EOS More particularly, a unified big data aided machine learning framework is proposed, which consists of feature extraction, data modeling and prediction/online refinement. EOS The main benefits of the proposed framework are that by relying on big data which reflects both the spectral and other challenging requirements of the users, we can refine the motivation, problem formulations and methodology of powerful machine learning algorithms in the context of wireless networks. EOS In order to characterize the efficiency of the proposed framework, a pair of intelligent practical applications are provided as case studies: 1) To predict the positioning of drone-mounted areal base stations (BSs) according to the specific tele-traffic requirements by gleaning valuable data from social networks. EOS 2) To predict the content caching requirements of BSs according to the users' preferences by mining data from social networks.	Finally, open research opportunities are identified for motivating future investigations.

doc	Close-packed dimers on the line: diffraction versus dynamical spectrum EOS The translation action of _EQN_ on a translation bounded measure _EQN_ leads to an interesting class of dynamical systems, with a rather rich spectral theory. EOS In general, the diffraction spectrum of _EQN_, which is the carrier of the diffraction measure, live on a subset of the dynamical spectrum. EOS It is known that, under some mild assumptions, a pure point diffraction spectrum implies a pure point dynamical spectrum (the opposite implication always being true). EOS For other systems, the diffraction spectrum can be a proper subset of the dynamical spectrum, as was pointed out for the Thue-Morse sequence (with singular continuous diffraction) in REF.	Here, we construct a random system of close-packed dimers on the line that have some underlying long-range periodic order as well, and display the same type of phenomenon for a system with absolutely continuous spectrum.

doc	Chiral effective theories with a light scalar at one loop EOS There are indications that some theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking also feature a light scalar in their spectrum, with a mass comparable to the one of the Goldstone modes. EOS In this paper, we perform the one-loop renormalization of a theory of Goldstone modes invariant under a chiral _EQN_ symmetry group coupled to a generic scalar singlet.	We employ the background field method, together with the heat kernel expansion, to get an expression for the effective action at one loop and single out the anomalous dimensions, which can be read off from the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the invariant \[ \Lo(I)=\sup_ \varphi \in \Phi \left(\inf_ f\in I \frac \ord f \circ \varphi \ord \varphi \right) \] \noindent called the \L ojasiewicz exponent of _EQN_.
doc	Possibility of chromospheric back-radiation influencing the lithium line formation in Spite plateau stars EOS Spectroscopically determined Li abundances of metal-poor turn-off dwarfs are known to be nearly constant (Spite plateau), but lower than the primordial value expected from the standard cosmological model. EOS However, abundance determination by using conventional model atmospheres may not necessarily be correct since the existence of high-temperature chromosphere even in very old stars has been confirmed. EOS The aim of this study is to examine how the extra UV flux possibly irradiated from the chromosphere could affect the formation of the Li I 6708 line, and whether or not its influence might lead to a solution of the Li abundance discrepancy. EOS A simple model chromosphere of a uniform thin gray slab emitting only thermal radiation is assumed, characterized by optical thickness and temperature. EOS By taking into account this incident radiation in the surface boundary condition, non-LTE calculations for Li are carried out to see how the equivalent widths and the abundances are affected by these parameters.	If the parameters are appropriately chosen, the strength of the Li I 6708 line can be reduced by a factor of ~2-3 due to overionization caused by enhanced UV radiation, leading to a lowering of the abundance by ~0.3-0.5 dex, which is consistent with the discrepancy in question.

doc	New mixture models for decoy-free false discovery rate estimation in mass-spectrometry proteomics EOS Motivation: Accurate estimation of false discovery rate (FDR) of spectral identification is a central problem in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. EOS Over the past two decades, target decoy approaches (TDAs) and decoy-free approaches (DFAs), have been widely used to estimate FDR. EOS TDAs use a database of decoy species to faithfully model score distributions of incorrect peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). EOS DFAs, on the other hand, fit two-component mixture models to learn the parameters of correct and incorrect PSM score distributions. EOS While conceptually straightforward, both approaches lead to problems in practice, particularly in experiments that push instrumentation to the limit and generate low fragmentation-efficiency and low signal-to-noise-ratio spectra. EOS Results: We introduce a new decoy-free framework for FDR estimation that generalizes present DFAs while exploiting more search data in a manner similar to TDAs. EOS Our approach relies on multi-component mixtures, in which score distributions corresponding to the correct PSMs, best incorrect PSMs, and second-best incorrect PSMs are modeled by the skew normal family. EOS We derive EM algorithms to estimate parameters of these distributions from the scores of best and second-best PSMs associated with each experimental spectrum. EOS We evaluate our models on multiple proteomics datasets and a HeLa cell digest case study consisting of more than a million spectra in total.	We provide evidence of improved performance over existing DFAs and improved stability and speed over TDAs without any performance degradation.
doc	The Lie algebra of classical mechanics EOS Classical mechanical systems are defined by their kinetic and potential energies. EOS They generate a Lie algebra under the canonical Poisson bracket. EOS This Lie algebra, which is usually infinite dimensional, is useful in analyzing the system, as well as in geometric numerical integration. EOS But because the kinetic energy is quadratic in the momenta, the Lie algebra obeys identities beyond those implied by skew symmetry and the Jacobi identity. EOS Some Poisson brackets, or combinations of brackets, are zero for all choices of kinetic and potential energy, regardless of the dimension of the system. EOS Therefore, we study the universal object in this setting, the `Lie algebra of classical mechanics' modelled on the Lie algebra generated by kinetic and potential energy of a simple mechanical system with respect to the canonical Poisson bracket. EOS We show that it is the direct sum of an abelian algebra _EQN_, spanned by `modified' potential energies isomorphic to the free commutative nonassociative algebra with one generator, and an algebra freely generated by the kinetic energy and its Poisson bracket with _EQN_.	We calculate the dimensions _EQN_ of its homogeneous subspaces and determine the value of its entropy _EQN_.

doc	Probing TeV-scale gauge unification by hadronic collisions EOS Grand unified theories (GUTs) and extra dimensions are potential ingredients of the new physics that may resolve various outstanding problems of the Standard Model.	If the inverse size of (one of) the extra dimension(s) is smaller than the GUT scale and standard gauge bosons are allowed to propagate in the bulk then, among other consequences, the evolution of the gauge couplings deviates from the usual logarithmic running somewhat below and between these two scales.
doc	Large KAM tori for perturbations of the dNLS equation EOS We prove that small, semi-linear Hamiltonian perturbations of the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger (dNLS) equation on the circle have an abundance of invariant tori of any size and (finite) dimension which support quasi-periodic solutions.	When compared with previous results the novelty consists in considering perturbations which do not satisfy any symmetry condition (they may depend on _EQN_ in an arbitrary way) and need not be analytic.
doc	Matrix models for _EQN_ -ensembles from Nekrasov partition functions EOS We relate Nekrasov partition functions, with arbitrary values of _EQN_ parameters, to matrix models for _EQN_ -ensembles.

An additional, trigonometric deformation of the measure arises in five-dimensional theories.

Another solution of inverted hierarchy (IH) which is 0.46 _EQN_ away from best fit was also reported.
doc	Entanglement in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation EOS The role of electron-nuclear entanglement on the validity of the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is investigated. EOS While nonadiabatic couplings generally lead to entanglement and to a failure of the BO approximation, surprisingly the degree of electron-nuclear entanglement is found to be uncorrelated with the degree of validity of the BO approximation. EOS This is because while the degree of entanglement of BO states is determined by their deviation from the corresponding states in the crude BO approximation, the accuracy of the BO approximation is dictated, instead, by the deviation of the BO states from the exact electron-nuclear states. EOS In fact, in the context of a minimal avoided crossing model, extreme cases are identified where an adequate BO state is seen to be maximally entangled, and where the BO approximation fails but the associated BO state remains approximately unentangled.	Further, the BO states are found to not preserve the entanglement properties of the exact electron-nuclear eigenstates, and to be completely unentangled only in the limit in which the BO approximation becomes exact.

doc	Vertical stratification of iron abundance in atmospheres of blue horizontal-branch stars EOS The observed slow rotation and abundance peculiarities of certain blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars suggests that atomic diffusion can be important in their stellar atmospheres and can lead to vertical abundance stratification of chemical species in the atmosphere. EOS To verify this hypothesis, we have undertaken an abundance stratification analysis in the atmospheres of six BHB stars, based on recently acquired McDonald-CE spectra. EOS Our numerical simulations show that the iron abundance is vertically stratified in the atmospheres of two stars in M15: B267 and B279. EOS One star WF2-2541 in M13 also appears to have vertically stratified iron abundance, while for WF4-3085 the signatures of iron stratification are less convincing.	In all cases the iron abundances increase towards the lower atmosphere.
doc	Matching for random systems with an application to minimal weight expansions EOS We extend the notion of matching for one-dimensional dynamical systems to random matching for random dynamical systems on an interval.

doc	Representation Learning for Electronic Health Records EOS Information in electronic health records (EHR), such as clinical narratives, examination reports, lab measurements, demographics, and other patient encounter entries, can be transformed into appropriate data representations that can be used for downstream clinical machine learning tasks using representation learning. EOS Learning better representations is critical to improve the performance of downstream tasks. EOS Due to the advances in machine learning, we now can learn better and meaningful representations from EHR through disentangling the underlying factors inside data and distilling large amounts of information and knowledge from heterogeneous EHR sources. EOS In this chapter, we first introduce the background of learning representations and reasons why we need good EHR representations in machine learning for medicine and healthcare in Section 1. EOS Next, we explain the commonly-used machine learning and evaluation methods for representation learning using a deep learning approach in Section 2. EOS Following that, we review recent related studies of learning patient state representation from EHR for clinical machine learning tasks in Section 3.	Finally, in Section 4 we discuss more techniques, studies, and challenges for learning natural language representations when free texts, such as clinical notes, examination reports, or biomedical literature are used.

doc	Multiwavelength XMM-Newton observations of the Laor et al sample of PG quasars EOS We present XMM-Newton/EPIC spectra for the Laor et al sample of Palomar Green quasars. EOS We find that a power-law provides a reasonable fit to the 2-5 keV region of the spectra. EOS Excess soft X-ray emission below 2 keV is present for all objects, with the exception of those known to contain a warm absorber. EOS A single power-law is, however, a poor fit to the 0.3-10.0 keV spectrum and instead we find that a simple model, consisting of a broken power-law (plus an iron line), provides a reasonable fit in most cases. EOS The equivalent width of the emission line is constrained in just twelve objects but with low (<2 sigma) significance in most cases. EOS For the sources whose spectra are well-fit by the broken power-law model, we find that various optical and X-ray line and continuum parameters are well-correlated; EOS in particular, the power-law photon index is well-correlated with the FWHM of the Hbeta line and the photon indices of the low and high energy components of the broken power-law are well-correlated with each other.	These results suggest that the 0.3-10 keV X-ray emission shares a common (presumably non-thermal) origin, as opposed to suggestions that the soft excess is directly produced by thermal disc emission or via an additional spectral component.
doc	Random Sequential Adsorption on a Line: Mean-Field Theory of Diffusional Relaxation EOS We develop a new fast-diffusion approximation for the kinetics of deposition of extended objects on a linear substrate, accompanied by diffusional relaxation.	This new approximation plays the role of the mean-field theory for such processes and is valid over a significantly larger range than an earlier variant, which was based on a mapping to chemical reactions.
doc	Thermal radiation and near-field energy density of thin metallic films EOS We study the properties of thermal radiation emitted by a thin dielectric slab, employing the framework of macroscopic fluctuational electrodynamics. EOS Particular emphasis is given to the analytical construction of the required dyadic Green's functions. EOS Based on these, general expressions are derived for both the system's Poynting vector, describing the intensity of propagating radiation, and its energy density, containing contributions from non-propagating modes which dominate the near-field regime. EOS An extensive discussion is then given for thin metal films. EOS It is shown that the radiative intensity is maximized for a certain film thickness, due to Fabry-Perot-like multiple reflections inside the film. EOS The dependence of the near-field energy density on the distance from the film's surface is governed by an interplay of several length scales, and characterized by different exponents in different regimes. EOS In particular, this energy density remains finite even for arbitrarily thin films.	This unexpected feature is associated with the film's low-frequency surface plasmon polariton.
doc	Testing Physical Models for Cosmic Ray Transport Coefficients on Galactic Scales: Self-Confinement and Extrinsic Turbulence at GeV Energies EOS The microphysics of ~GeV cosmic ray (CR) transport on galactic scales remain deeply uncertain, with almost all studies adopting simple prescriptions (e.g. EOS constant-diffusivity). EOS We explore different physically-motivated, anisotropic, dynamical CR transport scalings in high-resolution cosmological FIRE simulations of dwarf and ~ _EQN_ galaxies where scattering rates vary with local plasma properties motivated by extrinsic turbulence (ET) or self-confinement (SC) scenarios, with varying assumptions about e.g. EOS turbulent power spectra on un-resolved scales, Alfven-wave damping, etc. EOS We self-consistently predict observables including _EQN_ -rays (_EQN_), grammage, residence times, and CR energy densities to constrain the models.	We demonstrate many non-linear dynamical effects (not captured in simpler models) tend to enhance confinement.
doc	Non-azimuthal linear polarization in protoplanetary disks EOS Several studies discussing imaging polarimetry observations of protoplanetary disks use the so-called radial Stokes parameters Q_phi and U_phi to discuss the results. EOS This approach has the advantage of providing a direct measure of the noise in the polarized images under the assumption that the polarization is azimuthal only, i.e., perpendicular to the direction towards the illuminating source. EOS However, a detailed study of the validity of this assumption is currently missing. EOS We aim to test whether departures from azimuthal polarization can naturally be produced by scattering processes in optically thick protoplanetary disks at near infrared wavelengths. EOS We use the radiative transfer code MCFOST to create a generic model of a transition disk using different grain size distributions and dust masses. EOS From these models we generate synthetic polarized images at 2.2\mum. EOS We find that even for moderate inclinations (e.g., i = 40degr), multiple scattering alone can produce significant (up to ~4.5% of the Q_phi image) non-azimuthal polarization reflected in the U_phi images. EOS We also find that different grain populations can naturally produce radial polarization (negative values in the Q_phi images). EOS Our results suggest that caution is recommended when interpreting polarized images by only analyzing the Q_phi and U_phi images. EOS We find that there can be astrophysical signal in the U_phi images and negative values in the Q_phi images, which indicate departures from azimuthal polarization. EOS If significant signal is detected in the U_phi images, we recommend to check the standard Q and U images to look for departures from azimuthal polarization.	On the positive side, signal in the U_phi images once all instrumental and data-reduction artifacts have been corrected for means that there is more information to be extracted regarding the dust population and particle density.
doc	Two-gluon rapidity correlations of strong colour field in _EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_ collisions EOS Using the CGC formalism, we calculate the two-gluon rapidity correlations of strong colour fields in _EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_ collisions, respectively. EOS If one trigger gluon is fixed at central rapidity, a ridge-like correlation pattern is obtained in symmetry _EQN_ and _EQN_ collisions, and a huge bump-like correlation pattern is presented in asymmetry _EQN_ collisions. EOS It is demonstrated that the ridge-like correlation patterns are caused by the stronger correlation with the gluon of colour source.	The transverse momentum and incident energy dependence of the ridge-like correlation pattern is also systematically studied.
doc	Coqblin-Schrieffer Model for an Ultra-cold Gas of Ytterbium atoms with Metastable States EOS Motivated by the impressive recent advance in manipulating cold ytterbium atoms we explore and substantiate the feasibility of realizing the Coqblin-Schrieffer model in a gas of cold fermionic _EQN_ Yb atoms. EOS Making use of different AC polarizabillity of the electronic ground state (electronic configuration _EQN_) and the long lived metastable state (electronic configuration _EQN_), it is substantiated that the latter can be localized and serve as a magnetic impurity while the former remains itinerant. EOS The exchange mechanism between the itinerant _EQN_ and the localized _EQN_ atoms is analyzed and shown to be antiferromagnetic.	The ensuing SU(6) symmetric Coqblin-Schrieffer Hamiltonian is constructed, and, using the calculated exchange constant _EQN_, perturbative RG analysis yield the Kondo temperature _EQN_ that is experimentally accessible.
doc	Bekenstein Bound of Information Number N and its Relation to Cosmological Parameters in a Universe with and without Cosmological Constant EOS Bekenstein has obtained is an upper limit on the entropy S, and from that, an information number bound N is deduced.

Similarly, this can be thought as the maximum amount of information required to perfectly describe a given physical system down to its quantum level.

From this, we show that in an important subspace _EQN_, where Parseval's equality and Riesz-Fischer theorem holds, its equivalence classes are sequentially compact and the family of translates of a function belonging to this subspace is dense in its own class.

doc	A measure of transcendence for singular points on conics EOS A singular point on a plane conic defined over _EQN_ is a transcendental point of the curve which admits very good rational approximations, uniformly in terms of the height. EOS Extremal numbers and Sturmian continued fractions are abscissa of such points on the parabola _EQN_.	In this paper we provide a measure of transcendence for singular points on conics defined over _EQN_ which, in these two cases, improves on the measure obtained by Adamczewski et Bugeaud.
doc	Compton recoil effects in staging of laser wakefield accelerators EOS Laser plasma accelerators capable of generating >10 GeV electron beams may require plasma mirrors to remove undepleted laser energy at the end of each accelerator stage. EOS Near the plasma mirror surface, the electron bunch can interact with the reflected light, resulting in inverse Compton scattering. EOS For realistic conditions, we show that a significant fraction of electrons emit one or more photons, increasing the energy spread of the electron bunch. EOS We provide an analytical expression for calculating this effect, and use it to estimate the minimum drift space required before the plasma mirror to meet given energy spread specifications.	Mitigation strategies, necessary to achieve sub-percent energy spread in multi-GeV laser wakefield electron sources, are proposed and explored.

EOS Without excluding the possibility of an exceptional Siegel zero, we cannot have _EQN_ and so this result is best-possible in this sense.	We obtain this result using analytic methods developed in the study of Linnik's constant.

It has been found that nonperturbative effects become important while approaching continuum physics within the lattice model.
doc	Generation and dynamics of optical beams with polarization singularities EOS We present a convenient method to generate vector beams of light having polarization singularities on their axis, via partial spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion in a suitably patterned liquid crystal cell. EOS The resulting polarization patterns exhibit a C-point on the beam axis and an L-line loop around it, and may have different geometrical structures such as \qo lemon, \qo star, and \qo spiral. EOS Our generation method allows us to control the radius of L-line loop around the central C-point.	Moreover, we investigate the free-air propagation of these fields across a Rayleigh range.
doc	No cores in dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies with bursty star formation histories EOS Measurements of the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies are often interpreted as requiring a constant density core at the centre, at odds with the "cuspy" inner profiles predicted by _EQN_ -body simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) haloes. EOS It has been suggested that this conflict could be resolved by fluctuations in the inner gravitational potential caused by the periodic removal of gas following bursts of star formation. EOS Earlier work has suggested that core formation requires a bursty and extended star formation history (SFH). EOS Here we investigate the structure of CDM haloes of dwarf galaxies (_EQN_) formed in the APOSTLE ('A Project of Simulating the Local Environment') and AURIGA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. EOS Our simulations have comparable or better resolution than others that make cores (_EQN_, gravitational softening _EQN_ pc). EOS Yet, we do not find evidence of core formation at any mass or any correlation between the inner slope of the DM density profile and temporal variations in the SFH.	APOSTLE and AURIGA dwarfs display a similar diversity in their cumulative SFHs to available data for Local Group dwarfs.
doc	On the Active Region Bright Grains Observed in the Transition Region Imaging Channels of IRIS EOS The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) provides spectroscopy and narrow band slit-jaw (SJI) imaging of the solar chromosphere and transition region at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. EOS Combined with high-resolution context spectral imaging of the photosphere and chromosphere as provided by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), we can now effectively trace dynamic phenomena through large parts of the solar atmosphere in both space and time. EOS IRIS SJI 1400 images from active regions, which primarily sample the transition region with the Si IV 1394 and 1403 \AA lines, reveal ubiquitous bright "grains" which are short-lived (2-5 min) bright roundish small patches of sizes 0.5-1.7" that generally move limbward with velocities up to about 30 km s _EQN_. EOS In this paper we show that many bright grains are the result of chromospheric shocks impacting the transition region. EOS These shocks are associated with dynamic fibrils (DFs), most commonly observed in H \alpha. EOS We find that the grains show strongest emission in the ascending phase of the DF, that the emission is strongest towards the top of the DF and that the grains correspond to a blueshift and broadening of the Si IV lines. EOS We note that the SJI 1400 grains can also be observed in the SJI 1330 channel which is dominated by C II lines.	Our observations show that a significant part of the active region transition region dynamics is driven from the chromosphere below rather than from coronal activity above.

doc	Pretraining Image Encoders without Reconstruction via Feature Prediction Loss EOS This work investigates three methods for calculating loss for autoencoder-based pretraining of image encoders: The commonly used reconstruction loss, the more recently introduced deep perceptual similarity loss, and a feature prediction loss proposed here; EOS the latter turning out to be the most efficient choice. EOS Standard auto-encoder pretraining for deep learning tasks is done by comparing the input image and the reconstructed image. EOS Recent work shows that predictions based on embeddings generated by image autoencoders can be improved by training with perceptual loss, i.e., by adding a loss network after the decoding step. EOS So far the autoencoders trained with loss networks implemented an explicit comparison of the original and reconstructed images using the loss network. EOS However, given such a loss network we show that there is no need for the time-consuming task of decoding the entire image. EOS Instead, we propose to decode the features of the loss network, hence the name "feature prediction loss". EOS To evaluate this method we perform experiments on three standard publicly available datasets (LunarLander-v2, STL-10, and SVHN) and compare six different procedures for training image encoders (pixel-wise, perceptual similarity, and feature prediction losses;	combined with two variations of image and feature encoding/decoding).
doc	A State-Failure--Network Method to Identify Critical Components in Power Systems EOS In order to mitigate cascading failure blackout risks in power systems, the critical components whose failures lead to high blackout risks should be identified.

The failures along the chains are recombined in the SF-network, where each failure is allocated a value that can reveal the blackout risks after their occurrences.
doc	Zero frequency divergence and gauge phase factor in the optical response theory EOS The static current-current correlation leads to the definitional zero frequency divergence (ZFD) in the optical susceptibilities. EOS Previous computations have shown nonequivalent results between two gauges (_EQN_ and _EQN_) under the exact same unperturbed wave functions. EOS We reveal that those problems are caused by the improper treatment of the time-dependent gauge phase factor in the optical response theory. EOS The gauge phase factor, which is conventionally ignored by the theory, is important in solving ZFD and obtaining the equivalent results between these two gauges.	The Hamiltonians with these two gauges are not necessary equivalent unless the gauge phase factor is properly considered in the wavefunctions.

EOS The analysis has been performed by taking into account both the components and the Cole-Cole plots (i.e. EOS the imaginary part as a function of the real part).	Numerical simulations have been used to individuate the fingerprints of the magnetic behaviour in the Vortex Glass phase.
doc	Analytical and Numerical Approaches to Pricing the Path-Dependent Options with Stochastic Volatility EOS In this paper new analytical and numerical approaches to valuating path-dependent options of European type have been developed.

EOS Baaquie, and generalized it to the case of path-dependent options, where the payoff function depends on the history of changes in the underlying asset. EOS The dependence of the implied volatility on the parameters of the stochastic volatility model has been studied. EOS It is shown that with proper choice of model parameters one can accurately reproduce the actual behavior of implied volatility.	As a consequence, it can assess more accurately the value of options.
doc	Quasi-local contribution to the scalar self-force: Non-geodesic Motion EOS We extend our previous calculation of the quasi-local contribution to the self-force on a scalar particle to general (not necessarily geodesic) motion in a general spacetime. EOS In addition to the general case and the case of a particle at rest in a stationary spacetime, we consider as examples a particle held at rest in Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman space-times.	This allows us to most easily analyse the effect of non-geodesic motion on our previous results and also allows for comparison to existing results for Schwarzschild spacetime.

doc	Predicting atomic dopant solvation in helium clusters: the MgHe _EQN_ case EOS We present a quantum Monte Carlo study of the solvation and spectroscopic properties of the Mg doped helium clusters MgHe _EQN_ with _EQN_. EOS Three high level (MP4, CCSD(T) and CCSDT) MgHe interaction potentials have been used to study the sensitivity of the dopant location on the shape of the pair interaction. EOS Despite the similar MgHe well depth, the pair distribution functions obtained in the diffusion Monte Carlo simulations markedly differ for the three pair potentials, therefore indicating different solubility properties for Mg in He _EQN_. EOS Moreover, we found interesting size effects for the behavior of the Mg impurity. EOS As a sensitive probe of the solvation properties, the Mg excitation spectra have been simulated for various cluster sizes and compared with the available experimental results. EOS The interaction between the excited _EQN_ P Mg atom and the He moiety has been approximated using the Diatomics-in-Molecules method and the two excited _EQN_ and _EQN_ MgHe potentials. EOS The shape of the simulated MgHe _EQN_ spectra show a substantial dependency on the location of the Mg impurity, and hence on the MgHe pair interaction employed. EOS To unravel the dependency of the solvation behavior on the shape of the computed potentials, exact Density Functional Theory has been adapted to the case of doped He _EQN_ and various energy distributions have been computed.	The results indicate the shape of the repulsive part of the MgHe potential as an important cause of the different behaviours.

EOS The initial mapping from 1D profiles onto multidimensional grids can generate severe numerical artifacts, one of the most severe of which is the violation of conservation laws for physical quantities. EOS We introduce a numerical scheme for mapping 1D spherically-symmetric data onto multidimensional meshes so that these physical quantities are conserved. EOS We verify our scheme by porting a realistic 1D Lagrangian stellar profile to the new multidimensional Eulerian hydro code CASTRO.

We also introduce a numerical scheme for initializing multidimensional supernova simulations with realistic perturbations predicted by 1D stellar evolution models.

doc	Visual Analytics for Temporal Hypergraph Model Exploration EOS Many processes, from gene interaction in biology to computer networks to social media, can be modeled more precisely as temporal hypergraphs than by regular graphs. EOS This is because hypergraphs generalize graphs by extending edges to connect any number of vertices, allowing complex relationships to be described more accurately and predict their behavior over time. EOS However, the interactive exploration and seamless refinement of such hypergraph-based prediction models still pose a major challenge. EOS We contribute Hyper-Matrix, a novel visual analytics technique that addresses this challenge through a tight coupling between machine-learning and interactive visualizations. EOS In particular, the technique incorporates a geometric deep learning model as a blueprint for problem-specific models while integrating visualizations for graph-based and category-based data with a novel combination of interactions for an effective user-driven exploration of hypergraph models.	To eliminate demanding context switches and ensure scalability, our matrix-based visualization provides drill-down capabilities across multiple levels of semantic zoom, from an overview of model predictions down to the content.

EOS The relevant parameter is the ratio _EQN_ between qubit-RTN coupling strength and RTN switching rate, that captures the physics of the crossover between Markovian and non-Markovian features of the dynamics. EOS For identical qubit-RTN subsystems, a threshold value _EQN_ of the crossover parameter separates exponential decay and onset of revivals; EOS different qualitative behaviors also show up by changing the initial conditions of the RTN.	We moreover show that, for different qubit-RTN subsystems, when both qubits are very strongly coupled to the RTN an increase in entanglement revival amplitude may occur during the dynamics.

doc	InverseRenderNet: Learning single image inverse rendering EOS We show how to train a fully convolutional neural network to perform inverse rendering from a single, uncontrolled image. EOS The network takes an RGB image as input, regresses albedo and normal maps from which we compute lighting coefficients. EOS Our network is trained using large uncontrolled image collections without ground truth. EOS By incorporating a differentiable renderer, our network can learn from self-supervision. EOS Since the problem is ill-posed we introduce additional supervision: 1. EOS We learn a statistical natural illumination prior, 2. EOS Our key insight is to perform offline multiview stereo (MVS) on images containing rich illumination variation.	From the MVS pose and depth maps, we can cross project between overlapping views such that Siamese training can be used to ensure consistent estimation of photometric invariants.
doc	Quingo: A Programming Framework for Heterogeneous Quantum-Classical Computing with NISQ Features EOS Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology proposes requirements that cannot be fully satisfied by existing Quantum Programming Languages (QPLs) or frameworks. EOS First, noisy qubits require repeatedly-performed quantum experiments, which explicitly operate some low-level configuration, such as pulses and timing of operations. EOS This requirement is beyond the scope or capability of most existing QPLs.	Though multiple existing QPLs or frameworks claim the support for near-term promising Heterogeneous Quantum-Classical Computing (HQCC) algorithms, extra code irrelevant to the computational steps has to be introduced, or the corresponding code can hardly be mapped to HQCC architectures while satisfying timing constraints in quantum-classical interaction.
doc	TrES-1: The Transiting Planet of a Bright K0V Star EOS We report the detection of a transiting Jupiter-sized planet orbiting a relatively bright (V=11.79) K0V star. EOS We detected the transit light-curve signature in the course of the TrES multi-site transiting planet survey, and confirmed the planetary nature of the companion via multicolor photometry and precise radial velocity measurements. EOS We designate the planet TrES-1; EOS its inferred mass is 0.75 +/- 0.07 Jupiter masses, its radius is 1.08 (+0.18/-0.04) Jupiter radii, and its orbital period is 3.030065 +/- 0.000008 days.	This planet has an orbital period similar to that of HD 209458b, but about twice as long as those of the OGLE transiting planets.
doc	A new method for calculation of traces of Dirac _EQN_ -matrices in Minkowski space EOS This paper presents some relations for orthonormal bases in the Minkowski space and isotropic tetrads constructed from the vectors of these bases. EOS As an example of an application of the obtained formulae, in particular recursion relations, a new method is proposed to calculate traces of Dirac _EQN_ -matrices in the Minkowski space. EOS Compared to the classical algorithms, the new method results in more compact expressions for the traces.	Specifically, it may be easily implemented as a simple yet efficient computer algorithm.
doc	The ALTCRISS project on board the International Space Station EOS The Altcriss project aims to perform a long term survey of the radiation environment on board the International Space Station. EOS Measurements are being performed with active and passive devices in different locations and orientations of the Russian segment of the station. EOS The goal is to perform a detailed evaluation of the differences in particle fluence and nuclear composition due to different shielding material and attitude of the station. EOS The Sileye-3/Alteino detector is used to identify nuclei up to Iron in the energy range above 60 MeV/n. EOS Several passive dosimeters (TLDs, CR39) are also placed in the same location of Sileye-3 detector. EOS Polyethylene shielding is periodically interposed in front of the detectors to evaluate the effectiveness of shielding on the nuclear component of the cosmic radiation.	The project was submitted to ESA in reply to the AO in the Life and Physical Science of 2004 and data taking began in December 2005.
doc	Joint NuSTAR and Chandra analysis of the obscured quasar in IC 2497 - Hanny's Voorwerp system EOS We present new Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations of the core of IC 2497, the galaxy associated with Hanny's Voorwerp. EOS The combined fits of the Chandra (0.5-8 keV) and NuSTAR (3-24 keV) X-ray spectra, together with WISE mid-IR photometry, optical longslit spectroscopy and optical narrow-band imaging, suggest that the galaxy hosts a Compton-thick AGN (_EQN_ cm _EQN_, current intrinsic luminosity _EQN_ erg s _EQN_) whose luminosity dropped by a factor of _EQN_ 50 within the last _EQN_ kyr. EOS This corresponds to a change in Eddington ratio from _EQN_ 0.35 to _EQN_ 0.007. EOS We argue that the AGN in IC 2497 should not be classified as a changing-look AGN, but rather we favour the interpretation where the AGN is undergoing a change in accretion state (from radiatively efficient to radiatively inefficient). EOS In this scenario the observed drop in luminosity and Eddington ratio corresponds to the final stage of an AGN accretion phase. EOS Our results are consistent with previous studies in the optical, X-ray and radio although the magnitude of the drop is lower than previously suggested.	In addition, we discuss a possible analogy between X-ray binaries and an AGN.
doc	Magnetic fields in cosmological simulations of disk galaxies EOS Observationally, magnetic fields reach equipartition with thermal energy and cosmic rays in the interstellar medium of disk galaxies such as the Milky Way. EOS However, thus far cosmological simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxies have usually neglected magnetic fields. EOS We employ the moving-mesh code \textsc Arepo to follow for the first time the formation and evolution of a Milky Way-like disk galaxy in its full cosmological context while taking into account magnetic fields.	We find that a prescribed tiny magnetic seed field grows exponentially by a small-scale dynamo until it saturates around _EQN_ with a magnetic energy of about _EQN_ of the kinetic energy in the center of the galaxy's main progenitor halo.
doc	Cryptography based on neural networks - analytical results EOS Mutual learning process between two parity feed-forward networks with discrete and continuous weights is studied analytically, and we find that the number of steps required to achieve full synchronization between the two networks in the case of discrete weights is finite. EOS The synchronization process is shown to be non-self-averaging and the analytical solution is based on random auxiliary variables.	The learning time of an attacker that is trying to imitate one of the networks is examined analytically and is found to be much longer than the synchronization time.
doc	Universal law for waiting internal time in seismicity and its implication to earthquake network EOS In their paper (Europhys. EOS Lett., 71 (2005) 1036), Carbone, Sorriso-Valvo, Harabaglia and Guerra showed that "unified scaling law" for conventional waiting times of earthquakes claimed by Bak et al (Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett., 88 (2002) 178501) is actually not universal.	Here, instead of the conventional time, the concept of the internal time termed the event time is considered for seismicity.
doc	Evidence for extended gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters EOS We report evidence for extended gamma-ray emission from the Virgo, Fornax and Coma clusters based on a maximum-likelihood analysis of the 3-year Fermi-LAT data. EOS For all three clusters, excess emission is observed within three degrees of the center, peaking at the GeV scale. EOS This emission cannot be accounted for by known Fermi sources or by the galactic and extragalactic backgrounds. EOS If interpreted as annihilation emission from supersymmetric dark matter (DM) particles, the data prefer models with a particle mass in the range 20-60 GeV annihilating into the b-bbar channel, or 2-10 GeV and >1 TeV annihilating into mu-mu final states.	Our results are consistent with those obtained by Hooper and Linden from a recent analysis of Fermi-LAT data in the region of the Galactic Centre.
doc	Large-scale Continuous Gesture Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks EOS This paper addresses the problem of continuous gesture recognition from sequences of depth maps using convolutional neutral networks (ConvNets). EOS The proposed method first segments individual gestures from a depth sequence based on quantity of movement (QOM). EOS For each segmented gesture, an Improved Depth Motion Map (IDMM), which converts the depth sequence into one image, is constructed and fed to a ConvNet for recognition.	The IDMM effectively encodes both spatial and temporal information and allows the fine-tuning with existing ConvNet models for classification without introducing millions of parameters to learn.
doc	Diffuse radio emission in MACS J1752.0+4440 EOS We report the discovery of large-scale diffuse radio emission in the galaxy cluster MACS J1752.0+4440 (z=0.366). EOS Using Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) observations we find that the cluster hosts a double radio relic system as well as a 1.65 Mpc radio halo covering the region between the two relics. EOS The relics are diametrically located on opposite sides of the cluster center. EOS The NE and SW relics have sizes of 1.3 and 0.9 Mpc, respectively. EOS In case of an isolated binary merger event, the relative sizes of the relics suggest a mass ratio about 2:1. EOS We measure integrated spectra of -1.16 \pm 0.03 for the NE and -1.10 \pm 0.05 for the SW relic. EOS We conclude that this cluster has undergone a violent binary merger event and the relics are best explained by particles (re)accelerated in outwards traveling shock waves. EOS The spectral indices suggest the relics trace shock waves with Mach numbers (M) of around 3.5 to 4.5.	These relatively high Mach numbers derived from the radio spectral index are comparable to those derived for a few other recently discovered relics.
doc	Emergence of pointer states in a non-perturbative environment EOS We show that the pointer basis distinguished by collisional decoherence consists of exponentially localized, solitonic wave packets.	Based on the orthogonal unraveling of the quantum master equation, we characterize their formation and dynamics, and we demonstrate that the statistical weights arising from an initial superposition state are given by the required projection.
doc	Fractional instantons and bions in the principal chiral model on _EQN_ with twisted boundary conditions EOS Bions are multiple fractional instanton configurations with zero instanton charge playing important roles in quantum field theories on a compactified space with a twisted boundary condition. EOS We classify fractional instantons and bions in the _EQN_ principal chiral model on _EQN_ with twisted boundary conditions. EOS We find that fractional instantons are global vortices wrapping around _EQN_ with their _EQN_ moduli twisted along _EQN_, that carry _EQN_ instanton (baryon) numbers for the _EQN_ symmetric twisted boundary condition and irrational instanton numbers for generic boundary condition.	We work out neutral and charged bions for the _EQN_ case with the _EQN_ symmetric twisted boundary condition.
doc	Topological properties in topological insulators and superconductors EOS We give a self-contained and enriched review about topology properties in the rapidly growing field of topological states of matter (TSM). EOS This review is mainly focus on the beautiful interplay of topology mathematics and condensed matter physics that issuing TSM. EOS Fiber bundle theory is a powerful concept to describe the non-trivial topology properties underlying the physical system.	So we briefly present some motivation of fiber bundle theory and following that several effective topological methods have been introduced to judge whether a fiber bundle is trivial or not.
doc	Coherence-Pattern Guided Compressive Sensing with Unresolved Grids EOS Highly coherent sensing matrices arise in discretization of continuum imaging problems such as radar and medical imaging when the grid spacing is below the Rayleigh threshold. EOS Algorithms based on techniques of band exclusion (BE) and local optimization (LO) are proposed to deal with such coherent sensing matrices. EOS These techniques are embedded in the existing compressed sensing algorithms such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Subspace Pursuit (SP), Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), Basis Pursuit (BP) and Lasso, and result in the modified algorithms BLOOMP, BLOSP, BLOIHT, BP-BLOT and Lasso-BLOT, respectively. EOS Under appropriate conditions, it is proved that BLOOMP can reconstruct sparse, widely separated objects up to one Rayleigh length in the Bottleneck distance independent of the grid spacing. EOS One of the most distinguishing attributes of BLOOMP is its capability of dealing with large dynamic ranges. EOS The BLO-based algorithms are systematically tested with respect to four performance metrics: dynamic range, noise stability, sparsity and resolution.	With respect to dynamic range and noise stability, BLOOMP is the best performer.
doc	A supra-massive magnetar central engine for short GRB 130603B EOS We show that the peculiar early optical and in particular X-ray afterglow emission of the short duration burst GRB 130603B can be explained by continuous energy injection into the blastwave from a supra-massive magnetar central engine. EOS The observed energetics and temporal/spectral properties of the late infrared bump (i.e., the "kilonova") are also found consistent with emission from the ejecta launched during an NS-NS merger and powered by a magnetar central engine.	The isotropic-equivalent kinetic energies of both the GRB blastwave and the kilonova are about _EQN_ erg, consistent with being powered by a near-isotropic magnetar wind.
doc	STARS: A software application for the EBEX autonomous daytime star cameras EOS The E and B Experiment (EBEX) is a balloon-borne telescope designed to probe polarization signals in the CMB resulting from primordial gravitational waves, gravitational lensing, and Galactic dust emission.	EBEX completed an 11 day flight over Antarctica in January 2013 and data analysis is underway.
doc	Supercurrent generation by spin-twisting itinerant motion of electrons EOS Superconductivity is a phenomena where an external-feeding current flows through the system without voltage drop. EOS This indicates the existence of an energy minimum under the current feeding boundary condition. EOS Although it is believed that superconductivity is explained by the BCS theory that attributes the origin of superconductivity to the electron pair formation, such an energy minimum has never been obtained by it. EOS We have found such a minimum in the system exhibiting spin twisting itinerant motion of electrons with the Rashba spin-orbit interaction, but without referring to the electron pairing.	The supercurrent is shown to have the London equation form that exhibits the flux quantum _EQN_.
doc	Distortion of Magnetic Fields in a Starless Core III: Polarization--Extinction Relationship in FeSt 1-457 EOS The relationship between dust polarization and extinction was determined for the cold dense starless molecular cloud core FeSt 1-457 based on the background star polarimetry of dichroic extinction at near-infrared wavelengths. EOS Owing to the known (three-dimensional) magnetic field structure, the observed polarizations from the core were corrected by considering (a) the subtraction of the ambient polarization component, (b) the depolarization effect of inclined distorted magnetic fields, and (c) the magnetic inclination angle of the core. EOS After these corrections, a linear relationship between polarization and extinction was obtained for the core in the range up to _EQN_ mag. EOS The initial polarization vs. EOS extinction diagram changed dramatically after the corrections of (a) to (c), with the correlation coefficient being refined from 0.71 to 0.79. EOS These corrections should affect the theoretical interpretation of the observational data. EOS The slope of the finally obtained polarization--extinction relationship is _EQN_ _EQN_ _EQN_, which is close to the statistically estimated upper limit of the interstellar polarization efficiency (Jones 1989).	This consistency suggests that the upper limit of interstellar polarization efficiency might be determined by the observational viewing angle toward polarized astronomical objects.
doc	Short-lived flashes of gamma radiation in a quasi-spherical Szekeres metric EOS In previous papers it was shown that gamma rays with characteristics similar to those of the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observed by astronomers may arise from suitably shaped nonuniformities in the Big Bang in a quasi-spherical Szekeres (QSS) model.	The gamma radiation arises by blueshifting the light emitted by hydrogen atoms at the end of the last scattering epoch along preferred directions that exist in QSS models.
doc	Effects of associated kernels in nonparametric multiple regressions EOS Associated kernels have been introduced to improve the classical continuous kernels for smoothing any functional on several kinds of supports such as bounded continuous and discrete sets. EOS This work deals with the effects of combined associated kernels on nonparametric multiple regression functions. EOS Using the Nadaraya-Watson estimator with optimal bandwidth matrices selected by cross-validation procedure, different behaviours of multiple regression estimations are pointed out according the type of multivariate associated kernels with correlation or not.	Through simulation studies, there are no effect of correlation structures for the continuous regression functions and also for the associated continuous kernels;
doc	Relic density calculations beyond tree-level, exact calculations versus effective couplings: the ZZ final state EOS The inferred value of the relic density from cosmological observations has reached a precision that is akin to that of the LEP precision measurements. EOS This level of precision calls for the evaluation of the annihilation cross sections of dark matter that goes beyond tree-level calculations as currently implemented in all codes for the computation of the relic density.	In supersymmetry radiative corrections are known to be large and thus must be implemented.
doc	A Better Memoryless Online Algorithm for FIFO Buffering Packets with Two Values EOS We consider scheduling packets with values in a capacity-bounded buffer in an online setting. EOS In this model, there is a buffer with limited capacity _EQN_. EOS At any time, the buffer cannot accommodate more than _EQN_ packets. EOS Packets arrive over time. EOS Each packet is associated with a non-negative value. EOS Packets leave the buffer only because they are either sent or dropped. EOS Those packets that have left the buffer will not be reconsidered for delivery any more. EOS In each time step, at most one packet in the buffer can be sent. EOS The order in which the packets are sent should comply with the order of their arrival time. EOS The objective is to maximize the total value of the packets sent in an online manner. EOS In this paper, we study a variant of this FIFO buffering model in which a packet's value is either 1 or _EQN_. EOS We present a deterministic memoryless 1.304-competitive algorithm. EOS This algorithm has the same competitive ratio as the one presented in (Lotker and Patt-Shamir. EOS PODC 2002, Computer Networks 2003). EOS However, our algorithm is simpler and does not employ any marking bits. EOS The idea used in our algorithm is novel and different from all previous approaches applied for the general model and its variants.	We do not proactively preempt one packet when a new packet arrives.
doc	Quantifying the Topology and Evolution of a Magnetic Flux Rope Associated with Multi-flare Activities EOS Magnetic flux rope (MFR) plays an important role in solar activities. EOS A quantitative assessment of the topology of an MFR and its evolution is crucial for a better understanding of the relationship between the MFR and the associated activities.	In this paper, we investigate the magnetic field of active region 12017 from 2014 March 28 to 29, where 12 flares were triggered by the intermittent eruptions of a filament (either successful or confined).
doc	A catalogue of orientable 3-manifolds triangulated by 30 coloured tetrahedra EOS The present paper follows the computational approach to 3-manifold classification via edge-coloured graphs, already performed by several authors with respect to orientable 3-manifolds up to 28 coloured tetrahedra, non-orientable 3-manifolds up to 26 coloured tetrahedra, genus two 3-manifolds up to 34 coloured tetrahedra: in fact, by automatic generation and analysis of suitable edge-coloured graphs, called crystallizations, we obtain a catalogue of all orientable 3-manifolds admitting coloured triangulations with 30 tetrahedra.	These manifolds are unambiguously identified via JSJ decompositions and fibering structures.
doc	Patterning of dielectric nanoparticles using dielectrophoretic forces generated by ferroelectric polydomain films EOS A theoretical study of a dielectrophoretic force, i.e. EOS the force acting on an electrically neutral particle in the inhomogeneous electric field, which is produced by a ferroelectric domain pattern, is presented. EOS It has been shown by several researchers that artificially prepared domain patterns with given geometry in ferroelectric single crystals represent an easy and flexible method for patterning dielectric nanoobjects using dielectrophoretic forces.	The source of the dielectrophoretic force is a strong and highly inhomogeneous (stray) electric field, which exists in the vicinity of the ferroelectric domain walls at the surface of the ferroelectric film.
doc	The Evolution of X-ray Clusters in Low Density Universes EOS We present results of N-body/gasdynamical simulations designed to investigate the evolution of X-ray clusters in a flat, low-density, cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogony. EOS The density profile of the dark matter component can be fitted rather accurately by the simple formula originally proposed by Navarro, Frenk & White to describe the structure of clusters in a CDM universe with _EQN_. EOS In projection, the shape of the dark matter radial density profile and the corresponding line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile are in very good agreement with the observed profiles for galaxies in the CNOC sample of clusters. EOS The gas in our simulated clusters is less centrally concentrated than the dark matter, and its radial density profile is well described by the familiar _EQN_ -model. EOS The total mass and velocity dispersion of our clusters can be accurately inferred (with _EQN_ uncertainty) from their X-ray emission-weighted temperature. EOS We generalize Kaiser's scaling relations for scale-free universes and show that the clusters in our simulations generally follow these relations. EOS The agreement between the simulations and the analytical results provides a convincing demonstration of the soundness of our gasdynamical numerical techniques. EOS The slope of the luminosity-temperature relation implied by the scaling relations, and obeyed by the simulations, is in disagreement with observations.	This suggests that non-gravitational effects such as preheating or cooling must have played an important role in determining the properties of the observed X-ray emission from galaxy clusters.
doc	Average Degree in Graph Powers EOS The kth power of a simple graph G, denoted G^k, is the graph with vertex set V(G) where two vertices are adjacent if they are within distance k in G.	We are interested in finding lower bounds on the average degree of G^k.
doc	Astrophysical Axion Bounds EOS Axion emission by hot and dense plasmas is a new energy-loss channel for stars.	Observational consequences include a modification of the solar sound-speed profile, an increase of the solar neutrino flux, a reduction of the helium-burning lifetime of globular-cluster stars, accelerated white-dwarf cooling, and a reduction of the supernova SN 1987A neutrino burst duration.
doc	Optical properties of infrared-bright dust-obscured galaxies viewed with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam EOS We report on the optical properties of infrared (IR)-bright dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) that are defined as (i-)_AB > 7.0. EOS Because supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in IR-bright DOGs are expected to be rapidly growing in the major merger scenario, they provide useful clues for understanding the co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. EOS However, the optical properties of IR-bright DOGs remain unclear because the optical emission of a DOG is very faint. EOS By combining ~ 105 deg^2 images of the optical, near-IR, and mid-IR data obtained from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey, the VISTA VIKING survey, and the WISE all-sky survey, respectively, 571 IR-bright DOGs were selected. EOS We found that IR-bright DOGs show a redder (g-z)_AB color than other populations of dusty galaxies, such as ultra-luminous IR galaxies (ULIRGs) at a similar redshift, with a significantly large dispersion. EOS Among the selected DOGs, star-formation (SF) dominated DOGs show a relatively red color, while active galactic nucleus (AGN) dominated DOGs show a rather blue color in optical. EOS This result is consistent with the idea that the relative AGN contribution in the optical emission becomes more significant at a later stage in the major merger scenario. EOS We discovered eight IR-bright DOGs showing a significant blue excess in blue HSC bands (BluDOGs).	This blue excess can be interpreted as a leaked AGN emission that is either a directly leaking or a scattered AGN emission, as proposed for some blue-excess Hot DOGs in earlier studies.
doc	Do interdisciplinary research teams deliver higher gains to science? EOS The present paper takes its place in the stream of studies that analyze the effect of interdisciplinarity on the impact of research output. EOS Unlike previous studies, in this study the interdisciplinarity of the publications is not inferred through their citing or cited references, but rather by identifying the authors' designated fields of research. EOS For this we draw on the scientific classification of Italian academics, and their publications as indexed in the WoS over a five-year period (2004-2008). EOS We divide the publications in three subsets on the basis the nature of co-authorship: those papers coauthored with academics from different fields, which show high intensity of inter-field collaboration ("specific" collaboration, occurring in 110 pairings of fields);	those papers coauthored with academics who are simply from different "non-specific" fields;
doc	On the multipliers at fixed points of self-maps of the projective plane EOS This paper deals with holomorphic self-maps of the complex projective plane and the algebraic relations among the eigenvalues of the derivatives at the fixed points. EOS These eigenvalues are constrained by certain index theorems such as the holomorphic Lefschetz fixed-point theorem. EOS A simple dimensional argument suggests there must exist even more algebraic relations that the ones currently known. EOS In this work we analyze the case of quadratic self-maps having an invariant line and obtain all such relations. EOS We also prove that a generic quadratic self-map with an invariant line is completely determined, up to linear equivalence, by the collection of these eigenvalues. EOS Under the natural correspondence between quadratic rational maps of _EQN_ and quadratic homogeneous vector fields on _EQN_, the algebraic relations among multipliers translate to algebraic relations among the Kowalevski exponents of a vector field.	As an application of our results, we describe the sets of integers that appear as the Kowalevski exponents of a class of quadratic homogeneous vector fields on _EQN_ having exclusively single-valued solutions.
doc	Cluster-based Haldane state in edge-shared tetrahedral spin-cluster chain: Fedotovite K _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ O(SO _EQN_) _EQN_ EOS Fedotovite K _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ O(SO _EQN_) _EQN_ is a candidate of new quantum spin systems, in which the edge-shared tetrahedral (EST) spin-clusters consisting of Cu _EQN_ are connected by weak inter-cluster couplings to from one-dimensional array. EOS Comprehensive experimental studies by magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, heat capacity, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements reveal the presence of an effective _EQN_ = 1 Haldane state below _EQN_ K. EOS Rigorous theoretical studies provide an insight into the magnetic state of K _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ O(SO _EQN_) _EQN_: an EST cluster makes a triplet in the ground state and one-dimensional chain of the EST induces a cluster-based Haldane state.	We predict that the cluster-based Haldene state emerges whenever the number of tetrahedra in the EST is _EQN_.
doc	Extensions of probability-preserving systems by measurably-varying homogeneous spaces and applications EOS We study a generalized notion of a homogeneous skew-product extension of a probability-preserving system in which the homogeneous space fibres are allowed to vary over the ergodic decomposition of the base.	The construction of such extensions rests on a simple notion of `direct integral' for a `measurable family' of homogeneous spaces, which has a number of precedents in older literature.
doc	Beyond Strings, Multiple Times and Gauge Theories of Area-Scalings Relativistic Transformations EOS Nottale's special scale-relativity principle was proposed earlier by the author as a plausible geometrical origin to string theory and extended objects. EOS Scale Relativity is to scales what motion Relativity is to velocities. EOS The universal, absolute, impassible, invariant scale under dilatations in Nature is taken to be the Planck scale, which is not the same as the string scale. EOS Starting with ordinary actions for strings and other extended objects, we show that gauge theories of volume-resolutions scale-relativistic symmetries, of the world volume measure associated with the extended ``fuzzy'' objects, are a natural and viable way to formulate the geometrical principle underlying the theory of all extended objects. EOS Gauge invariance can only be implemented if the extendon actions in _EQN_ target dimensions are embedded in _EQN_ dimensions with an extra temporal variable corresponding to the scaling dimension of the original string coordinates. EOS This is achieved upon viewing the extendon coordinates, from the fuzzy worldvolume point of view, as noncommuting matrices valued in the Lie algebra of Lorentz-scale relativistic transformations. EOS Preliminary steps are taken to merge motion relativity with scale relativity by introducing the gauge field that gauges the Lorentz-scale symmetries in the same vain that the spin connection gauges ordinary Lorentz transformations and, in this fashion, one may go beyond string theory to construct the sought-after General Theory of Scale-Motion Relativity. EOS Such theory requires the introduction of the scale-graviton (in addition to the ordinary graviton) which is the field that gauges the symmetry which converts motion dynamics into scaling-resolutions dynamics and vice versa (the analog of the gravitino that gauges supersymmetry).	To go beyond the quantum string geometry most probably
doc	Hot self-similar relativistic MHD flows EOS We consider axisymmetric relativistic jets with a toroidal magnetic field and an ultrarelativistic equation of state, with the goal of studying the lateral structure of jets whose pressure is matched to the pressure of the medium through which they propagate. EOS We find all self-similar steady-state solutions of the relativistic MHD equations for this setup. EOS One of the solutions is the case of a parabolic jet being accelerated by the pressure gradient as it propagates through a medium with pressure declining as p(z)\propto z^ -2. EOS As the jet material expands due to internal pressure gradients, it runs into the ambient medium resulting in a pile-up of material along the jet boundary, while the magnetic field acts to produce a magnetic pinch along the axis of the jet. EOS Such jets can be in a lateral pressure equilibrium only if their opening angle \theta_j at distance z is smaller than about 1/\gamma, where \gamma is the characteristic bulk Lorentz-factor at this distance; EOS otherwise, different parts of the jet cannot maintain causal contact. EOS We construct maps of optically thin synchrotron emission from our self-similar models. EOS We suggest that the boundary pile-up may be the reason for the limb-brightening of the sub-parsec jet of M87. EOS We find that if the synchrotron emissivity falls with the distance from the jet axis, the polarization fraction rises toward the edge, as seen in 3C273 and Mkn501.	Projection effects and the emissivity pattern of the jet have a strong effect on the observed polarization signal, so the interpretation of the polarization data in terms of the geometry of magnetic fields is rather uncertain.

doc	Generalized Spacing-Statistics and a New Family of Non-Parametric Tests EOS Random divisions of an interval arise in various context, including statistics, physics, and geometric analysis. EOS For testing the uniformity of a random partition of the unit interval _EQN_ into _EQN_ disjoint subintervals of size _EQN_, Greenwood (1946) suggested using the squared _EQN_ -norm of this size vector as a test statistic, prompting a number of subsequent studies. EOS Despite much progress on understanding its power and asymptotic properties, attempts to find its exact distribution have succeeded so far for only small values of _EQN_. EOS Here, we develop an efficient method to compute the distribution of the Greenwood statistic and more general spacing-statistics for an arbitrary value of _EQN_. EOS Specifically, we consider random divisions of _EQN_ into _EQN_ subsets of consecutive integers and study _EQN_, the _EQN_ th power of the weighted _EQN_ -norm of the subset size vector _EQN_ for arbitrary weights _EQN_.	We present an exact and quickly computable formula for its moments, as well as a simple algorithm to accurately reconstruct a probability distribution using the moment sequence.
doc	Indecomposables live in all smaller lengths EOS Let _EQN_ be a finite-dimensional _EQN_ -algebra with _EQN_ algebraically closed. EOS Bongartz has recently shown that the existence of an indecomposable _EQN_ -module of length _EQN_ implies that also indecomposable _EQN_ -modules of length _EQN_ exist. EOS Using a slight modification of his arguments, we strengthen the assertion as follows: If there is an indecomposable module of length _EQN_, then there is also an accessible one. EOS Here, the accessible modules are defined inductively, as follows: First, the simple modules are accessible.	Second, a module of length _EQN_ is accessible provided it is indecomposable and there is a submodule or a factor module of length _EQN_ which is accessible.
doc	Investigation of Ultrathin Layers of Bis(phthalocyaninato)lutetium(III) on Graphite EOS We present a comprehensive study of the adsorption of bis(phthalocyaninato)lutetium(III) (LuPc _EQN_) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite(0001) (HOPG). EOS The growth and self-assembly of the molecular layers as well as the electronic structure has been investigated systematically using scanning tunnelling microscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular mechanics simulations. EOS We reveal that the adsorption of LuPc _EQN_ leads to the formation of a square-like close-packed structure on the almost inert surface of HOPG, which is corroborated by simulations.	Moreover, we observed a parallel orientation of the LuPc _EQN_ molecules in the first monolayer, whereas in subsequent layers an increasing tilt out of the surface plane was found.

doc	The morphology of minor axis gaseous outflows in edge-on Seyfert galaxies EOS (Abridged) Spiral galaxies often have extended outflows that permeate beyond the region of the disk. EOS Such outflows have been seen both in starburst galaxies, actively star forming galaxies and galaxies with an AGN. EOS In the latter galaxies it is unknown whether the large-scale outflows are driven by star formation activity or purely by the active nucleus. EOS The aim of our investigation is to study the frequency of extended minor-axis outflows in edge-on Seyfert galaxies to investigate the role of the AGN, the circumnuclear environment and star formation activity within the disk regions, and their importance for IGM enrichment on large scales. EOS Narrowband imaging in two different ionizational stages (H-alpha and [OIII]) was performed to attempt a discrimination between processes associated with the active nucleus and those connected to star forming activity within the disk. EOS The H-alpha morphology of the Seyfert galaxies is usually complex, but only in three out of 14 galaxies did we find evidence for minor axis disk outflows. EOS At the sensitivity of our observations [OIII] emission is generally detected only in the nuclear region.	Overall, our results show that extraplanar emission of similar brightness and extent as in the previously known cases of NGC3079 and NGC4388 is not common in Seyfert galaxies of otherwise similar properties.

doc	Magnetic resonance detection of individual proton spins using a quantum reporter network EOS We demonstrate a method of magnetic resonance imaging with single nuclear-spin sensitivity under ambient conditions. EOS It employs a network of isolated electronic-spin quantum bits (qubits) that act as quantum reporters on the surface of high purity diamond. EOS The reporter spins are localized with nanometer-scale uncertainty, and their quantum state is coherently manipulated and measured optically via a proximal nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center located a few nanometers below the diamond surface.	The quantum reporter network is then used for sensing, coherent coupling and imaging individual proton spins on the diamond surface with angstrom resolution.
doc	When conceptual worlds collide: The GUP and the BH entropy EOS Recently, there has been much attention devoted to resolving the quantum corrections to the Bekenstein--Hawking (black hole) entropy. EOS In particular, many researchers have expressed a vested interest in fixing the coefficient of the sub-leading logarithmic term. EOS In the current paper, we are able to make some substantial progress in this direction by utilizing the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). EOS Notably, the GUP reduces to the conventional Heisenberg relation in situations of weak gravity but transcends it when gravitational effects can no longer be ignored. EOS Ultimately, we formulate the quantum-corrected entropy in terms of an expansion that is consistent with all previous findings.	Moreover, we demonstrate that the logarithmic prefactor (indeed, any coefficient of the expansion) can be expressed in terms of a single parameter that should be determinable via the fundamental theory.
doc	Further Clues to the Nature of Composite LINER/HII Galaxies EOS We have analyzed new, archival and published high resolution radio and X-ray observations of a sample of composite LINER/HII galaxies known to exhibit AGN-like properties. EOS Five of the 16 AGN candidates have milliarcsecond-scale detections and are found to display a compact, flat spectrum, high brightness temperature radio core, four of which also exhibit extended radio emission. EOS Five of the eight AGN candidates with available high resolution X-ray observations were found to possess a hard X-ray nuclear source, two of which have no milliarcsecond radio detection.	The combined high resolution radio and X-ray data yield a 50% detection rate of low luminosity AGN among the AGN candidates, which translates into a 12% detection rate for the entire composite LINER/HII sample.
doc	Asymptotic Analysis of Regular Sequences EOS In this article, _EQN_ -regular sequences in the sense of Allouche and Shallit are analysed asymptotically. EOS It is shown that the summatory function of a regular sequence can asymptotically be decomposed as a finite sum of periodic fluctuations multiplied by a scaling factor. EOS Each of these terms corresponds to an eigenvalue of the sum of matrices of a linear representation of the sequence; EOS only the eigenvalues of absolute value larger than the joint spectral radius of the matrices contribute terms which grow faster than the error term. EOS The paper has a particular focus on the Fourier coefficients of the periodic fluctuations: They are expressed as residues of the corresponding Dirichlet generating function.	This makes it possible to compute them in an efficient way.

doc	NASCaps: A Framework for Neural Architecture Search to Optimize the Accuracy and Hardware Efficiency of Convolutional Capsule Networks EOS Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made significant improvements to reach the desired accuracy to be employed in a wide variety of Machine Learning (ML) applications. EOS Recently the Google Brain's team demonstrated the ability of Capsule Networks (CapsNets) to encode and learn spatial correlations between different input features, thereby obtaining superior learning capabilities compared to traditional (i.e., non-capsule based) DNNs. EOS However, designing CapsNets using conventional methods is a tedious job and incurs significant training effort. EOS Recent studies have shown that powerful methods to automatically select the best/optimal DNN model configuration for a given set of applications and a training dataset are based on the Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms. EOS Moreover, due to their extreme computational and memory requirements, DNNs are employed using the specialized hardware accelerators in IoT-Edge/CPS devices.	In this paper, we propose NASCaps, an automated framework for the hardware-aware NAS of different types of DNNs, covering both traditional convolutional DNNs and CapsNets.
doc	Optical approximation in the theory of geometric impedance EOS In this paper we introduce an optical approximation into the theory of impedance calculation, one valid in the limit of high frequencies. EOS This approximation neglects diffraction effects in the radiation process, and is conceptually equivalent to the approximation of geometric optics in electromagnetic theory. EOS Using this approximation, we derive equations for the longitudinal impedance for arbitrary offsets, with respect to a reference orbit, of source and test particles.	With the help of the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem we also obtain expressions for the transverse impedance (also for arbitrary offsets).

EOS Using a stochastic deformation of the SYK model, we show that its characteristic determinant obeys a viscid Burgers equation with a small spectral viscosity in the opposite regime with _EQN_, in leading order.	The stochastic evolution of the SYK model can be mapped onto that of random matrix theory, with universal Airy oscillations at the edges.

doc	A mode coupling theory for Brownian particles in homogeneous steady shear flow EOS A microscopic approach is presented for calculating general properties of interacting Brownian particles under steady shearing. EOS We start from exact expressions for shear-dependent steady-state averages, such as correlation and structure functions, in the form of generalized Green-Kubo relations. EOS To these we apply approximations inspired by the mode coupling theory (MCT) for the quiescent system, accessing steady-state properties by integration through the transient dynamics after startup of steady shear. EOS Exact equations of motion, with memory effects, for the required transient density correlation functions are derived next; EOS these can also be approximated within an MCT-like approach. EOS This results in closed equations for the non-equilibrium stationary state of sheared dense colloidal dispersions, with the equilibrium structure factor of the unsheared system as the only input. EOS In three dimensions, these equations currently require further approximation prior to numerical solution. EOS However, some universal aspects can be analyzed exactly, including the discontinuous onset of a yield stress at the ideal glass transition predicted by MCT. EOS Using these methods we additionally discuss the distorted microstructure of a sheared hard-sphere colloid near the glass transition, and consider how this relates to the shear stress. EOS Time-dependent fluctuations around the stationary state are then approximated, and compared to data from experiment and simulation;	the correlators for yielding glassy states obey a `time-shear-superposition' principle.

doc	Direct Automatic Coronary Calcium Scoring in Cardiac and Chest CT EOS Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the global leading cause of death. EOS A strong risk factor for CVD events is the amount of coronary artery calcium (CAC). EOS To meet demands of the increasing interest in quantification of CAC, i.e. EOS coronary calcium scoring, especially as an unrequested finding for screening and research, automatic methods have been proposed. EOS Current automatic calcium scoring methods are relatively computationally expensive and only provide scores for one type of CT. EOS To address this, we propose a computationally efficient method that employs two ConvNets: the first performs registration to align the fields of view of input CTs and the second performs direct regression of the calcium score, thereby circumventing time-consuming intermediate CAC segmentation. EOS Optional decision feedback provides insight in the regions that contributed to the calcium score. EOS Experiments were performed using 903 cardiac CT and 1,687 chest CT scans. EOS The method predicted calcium scores in less than 0.3 s. EOS Intra-class correlation coefficient between predicted and manual calcium scores was 0.98 for both cardiac and chest CT. EOS The method showed almost perfect agreement between automatic and manual CVD risk categorization in both datasets, with a linearly weighted Cohen's kappa of 0.95 in cardiac CT and 0.93 in chest CT.	Performance is similar to that of state-of-the-art methods, but the proposed method is hundreds of times faster.
doc	Forgetting the Forgotten with Letheia, Concealing Content Deletion from Persistent Observers EOS Most social platforms offer mechanisms allowing users to delete their posts, and a significant fraction of users exercise this right to be forgotten. EOS However, ironically, users' attempt to reduce attention to sensitive posts via deletion, in practice, attracts unwanted attention from stalkers specifically to those posts. EOS Thus, deletions may leave users more vulnerable to attacks on their privacy in general. EOS Users hoping to make their posts forgotten face a "damned if I do, damned if I don't" dilemma. EOS Many are shifting towards ephemeral social platform like Snapchat, which will deprive us of important user-data archival. EOS In the form of intermittent withdrawals, we present, Lethe, a novel solution to this problem of forgetting the forgotten. EOS If the next-generation social platforms are willing to give up the uninterrupted availability of non-deleted posts by a very small fraction, Lethe provides privacy to the deleted posts over long durations. EOS In presence of Lethe, an adversarial observer becomes unsure if some posts are permanently deleted or just temporarily withdrawn by Lethe; EOS at the same time, the adversarial observer is overwhelmed by a large number of falsely flagged undeleted posts.	To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of Lethe, we analyze large-scale real data about users' deletion over Twitter and thoroughly investigate how to choose time duration distributions for alternating between temporary withdrawals and resurrections of non-deleted posts.

EOS Recently, automated neural architecture search (NAS) emerges as the default technique to find a state-of-the-art CNN architecture with higher accuracy than manually-designed architectures for image classification. EOS In this paper, we present a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology, called S3NAS, to find a CNN architecture with higher accuracy than the existing ones under a given latency constraint. EOS It consists of three steps: supernet design, Single-Path NAS for fast architecture exploration, and scaling.	To widen the search space of the supernet structure that consists of stages, we allow stages to have a different number of blocks and blocks to have parallel layers of different kernel sizes.

EOS However, when the reference transcriptome used to calculate differential expression is incomplete, significant error in the inferred expression levels can result. EOS In this study, we use simulated reads generated from real transcriptomes to determine the accuracy of read mapping, and measure the error resulting from using an incomplete transcriptome.	We show that the two primary sources of count- ing error are 1) alternative splice variants that share reads and 2) missing transcripts from the reference.
doc	Two-dimensional superconductivity in a bulk single-crystal EOS Both Nb _EQN_ Pd _EQN_ Se _EQN_ and Ta _EQN_ Pd _EQN_ Te _EQN_ crystallize in a monoclinic point group while exhibiting superconducting transition temperatures as high as _EQN_ and _EQN_ K, respectively. EOS Disorder was claimed to lead to the extremely large upper critical fields (_EQN_) observed in related compounds. EOS Despite the presence of disorder and heavier elements, _EQN_ s in Ta _EQN_ Pd _EQN_ Te _EQN_ are found to be considerably smaller than those of Nb _EQN_ Pd _EQN_ Se _EQN_ while displaying an anomalous, non-saturating linear dependence on temperature _EQN_ for fields along all three crystallographic axes. EOS In contrast, crystals of the latter compound displaying the highest _EQN_ s display _EQN_, which in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides is claimed to be evidence for an Ising paired superconducting state resulting from strong spin-orbit coupling. EOS This anomalous _EQN_ -dependence indicates that the superconducting state of Nb _EQN_ Pd _EQN_ Se _EQN_ is quasi-two-dimensional in nature. EOS This is further supported by a nearly divergent anisotropy in upper-critical fields, i.e. EOS _EQN_, upon approaching _EQN_. EOS Hence, in Nb _EQN_ Pd _EQN_ Se _EQN_ the increase of _EQN_ correlates with a marked reduction in electronic dimensionality as observed, for example, in intercalated FeSe. EOS For the Nb compound, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that an increase in the external field produces an anisotropic orbital response, with especially strong polarization at the Pd sites when the field is perpendicular to their square planar environment.	Therefore, DFT suggests the field-induced pinning of the spin to the lattice as a possible mechanism for decoupling the superconducting planes.
doc	Physical interpretation of the UV/X-ray variability behavior of NGC 7469 EOS We present a re-analysis of the simultaneous 30 day IUE/XTE observation of NGC 7469 done in 1996. EOS Our main progress, in comparison to previous spectral analysis, is to adopt and fit directly to the data a detailed Comptonization model. EOS This firstly allows to fit simultaneously the data from the UV to the hard X-ray band in a self-consistent way and secondly it gives direct constraints on the physical parameters of the disc-corona system. EOS Our results are completely consistent with a slab geometry where all the observed UV emission is supposed to cross the corona but more photon-starved geometries also give acceptable fits. EOS Whatever the geometry is, the UV seed photon emission appears to be dominated by the reprocessing of the X-rays. EOS We also found very interesting correlations between the different model parameters, the most important one being the anticorrelation between the corona temperature and the UV flux. EOS Such an anticorrelation is clearly inconsistent with a fixed disc-corona configuration and suggests a variation of the geometry of the system. EOS We also find a correlation between the corona optical depth and the X-ray flux which may reflect processes linked to the corona formation. EOS During the observations, NGC 7469 appears to accrete near its Eddington limit.	This source could then be an example of magnetically dominated disc-corona system as recently proposed by Merloni (2003).
doc	Robust bipartite states with a positive partial transpose for metrology EOS Bipartite entangled quantum states with a positive partial transpose (in short PPT entangled states) are usually considered to be very weakly entangled, as no pure entanglement can be distilled from them.

EOS The first class of states is the same one that has been obtained by Badziag et al [Phys. EOS Rev. EOS A 90, 012301 (2014)]. EOS The second class of states fits the patterns of the PPT states found numerically in [G.	Toth and T.

EOS Due to its fundamental role in chemical and biological processes, carbon is a key element to trace. EOS We aim to identify the carriers and processes behind the extended NIR flux observed around several Herbig stars. EOS We compare the extended NIR flux from objects in the PIONIER Herbig Ae/Be survey with their flux in the PAH features. EOS HD 100453 is used as a benchmark case to investigate the influence of quantum heated particles, like PAHs or very small carbonaceous grains, in more detail. EOS We use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCMax to do a parameter study of the QHP size and scale- height and examine the influence of quantum heating on the amount of extended flux in the NIR visibilities. EOS There is a correlation between the PAH feature flux of a disk and the amount of its extended NIR flux. EOS We find that very small carbonaceous grains create the observed extended NIR flux around HD 100453 and still lead to a realistic SED. EOS These results can not be achieved without using quantum heating effects, e.g. EOS only with scattered light and grains in thermal equilibrium. EOS It is possible to explain the extended NIR emission around Herbig stars with the presence of carbonaceous, quantum heated particles.	Interferometric observations can be used to constrain the spatial distribution and typical size of carbonaceous material in the terrestrial planet forming region.
doc	Pseudogap and Kinetic Pairing Under Critical Differentiation of Electrons in Cuprate Superconductors EOS Superconducting mechanism of cuprates is discussed in the light of the proximity of the Mott insulator. EOS The proximity accompanied by suppression of coherence takes place in an inhomogeneous way in the momentum space in finite-dimensional systems. EOS Studies on instabilities of metals consisted of such differentiated electrons in the momentum space are reviewed from a general point of view. EOS A typical example of the differentiation is found in the flattening of the quasiparticle dispersion discovered around momenta _EQN_ and _EQN_ on 2D square lattices. EOS This flattening even controls the criticality of the metal-insulator transition. EOS Such differentiation and suppressed coherence subsequently cause an instability to the superconducting state in the second order of the strong coupling expansion. EOS The d-wave pairing interaction is generated from such local but kinetic processes in the absence of disturbance from the coherent single-particle excitations. EOS The superconducting mechanism emerges from a direct kinetic origin which is conceptually different from the pairing mechanism mediated by bosonic excitations as in magnetic, excitonic, and BCS mechanisms.	Pseudogap phenomena widely observed in the underdoped cuprates are then naturally understood from the mode-mode coupling of d-wave superconducting (dSC) fluctuations repulsively coupled with antiferromagnetic (AFM) ones.

doc	Quantum Mechanics and Superconductivity in a Magnetic Field EOS The influence of a magnetic field on superconductivity is usually described either phenomenologically, using Ginzburg-Landau theory, or semiclassically using Gor'kov theory. EOS In this article we discuss the influence of magnetic fields on the mean-field theory of the superconducting instability from a completely quantum mechanical point of view. EOS The suppression of superconductivity by an external magnetic field is seen in this more physically direct picture to be due to the impossibility, in quantum mechanics, of precisely specifying both the center-of-mass state of a pair and the individual electron kinetic energies.	We also discuss the possibility of novel aspects of superconductivity at extremely strong magnetic fields where recent work has shown that the transition temperature may be enhanced rather than suppressed by a magnetic field and where a quantum treatment is essential.

doc	A theory for superconductor-to-insulator transitions in a 2D electron liquid with strong spin-orbit impurity scattering EOS Superconductor-to-insulator transition (SIT) in 2D electron systems is an intriguing, controversial phenomenon in condensed matter physics, with no consensus as to its fundamental mechanism and expected ramifications. EOS Here we develop a theory of SIT in a 2D electron system, based solely on the opposing effects generated by Cooper-pair fluctuations: The large enhancement of conductivity due to fluctuating Cooper pairs (para-conductivity) in approaching the critical magnetic field, and its suppression associated with the loss of unpaired electrons due to Cooper-pairs formation. EOS The theory is tested using a model of a 2D electron liquid under a strong magnetic field subject to Zeeman spin-splitting pair-breaking and strong spin-orbit impurity scattering, which is realized experimentally in the system of electrons created in the (111) interface between crystalline SrTiO_ 3 and LaAlO_ 3. EOS Employing a modified Ginzburg-Landau (GL) functional approach, in which the interaction between Gaussian fluctuations are treated within the self-consistent Hartree approximation, the calculated sheet resistivity accounts well for extensive magnetoresistance (MR) data reported recently for the above mentioned 2D electron system.	At low temperatures, where the calculated MR curves exhibit quick narrowing of the MR peak versus the measured data, which show remarkable saturation upon decreasing temperature, the effect of quantum tunneling of cooper-pair through GL energy barriers is introduced within a phenomenological approach, yielding very good quantitative agreement with the experiment in the entire temperatures range.

EOS The Lie bracket [a,b] is defined as the signed sum over the intersection points of a and b of the loop product of at the intersection points. EOS If one of the classes has a simple representative we give a combinatorial group theory description of the terms of the Lie bracket and prove that this bracket has as many terms, counted with multiplicity, as the minimal number of intersection points of a and b. EOS In other words the bracket with a simple element has no cancellation and determines minimal intersection numbers.	We show that analogous results hold for the Lie bracket (also discovered by Goldman) of unoriented curves.

EOS We derive formulas for the expected volume and surface area of K.	Moreover, we show that in order to approximate K by a discrete version of K, namely by the convex hull of a random walk attained by taking B(t_n) at discrete (random) times, the number of steps that one should take in order for the volume of the difference to be relatively small is of order n^3.
doc	Markov-Yukawa Transversality On Covariant Null-Plane: Baryon Form Factor And Magnetic Moments EOS The baryon- _EQN_ vertex function governed by the Markov-Yukawa Transversality Principle (_EQN_), is formulated via the Covariant Null-Plane Ansatz (_EQN_) as a 3-body generalization of the corresponding _EQN_ problem, and employed to calculate the proton e.m. EOS form factor and baryon octet magnetic moments.The e.m. EOS coupling scheme is specified by letting the e.m. EOS field interact by turn with the `spectator' while the two interacting quarks fold back into the baryon. EOS The _EQN_ symmetry of the matrix element is preserved in all d.o.f.'s together. EOS The _EQN_ formulation ensures, as in the _EQN_ case, that the loop integral is free from the Lorentz mismatch disease of covariant instantaneity (_EQN_), while the simple trick of `Lorentz completion'ensures a Lorentz invariant structure. EOS The _EQN_ scaling behaviour at large _EQN_ is reproduced. EOS And with the infrared structure of the gluonic propagator attuned to spectroscopy, the charge radius of the proton comes out at _EQN_. EOS The magnetic moments of the baryon octet, also in good accord with data, are expressible as _EQN_, where _EQN_ are purely geometrical numbers and _EQN_ a dynamics-dependent quantity.

doc	New Method to Reveal the Conflict Between Local Realism and Quantum Mechanics EOS We formulate the expectation value of the Bell-Zukowski operator acting on qubit states of a two-particle Bell experiment. EOS By using the equivalence between a set of N copies of a two-qubit experiment and a standard two-setting Bell experiment in an entangled 2N-particle state, we obtain an inequality, which we may call the Bell-Zukowski inequality. EOS It determines whether the measured correlation functions of two-particle states can be modeled locally and realistically. EOS In this Bell experiment of two particles, the conflict between local realism and quantum mechanics is discussed in conjunction with the violation of the Bell-Zukowski inequality.	The main point of the result is that the Bell-Zukowski operator can be represented by the Bell-Mermin operator.
doc	Assessing molecular line diagnostics of triggered star formation using synthetic observations EOS We investigate observational signatures of triggered star formation in bright rimmed clouds (BRCs) by using molecular line transfer calculations based on radiation-hydrodynamic radiatively-driven-implosion models. EOS We find that for BRCs the separation in velocity between the line profile peak of an optically thick and an optically thin line is determined by both the observer viewing angle and the density of the shell driving into the cloud. EOS In agreement with observations, we find that most BRC line profiles are symmetric and that asymmetries can be either red or blue, in contrast to the blue-dominance expected for a collapsing cloud. EOS Asymmetries in the line profiles arise when an optically thick line is dominated by the shell and an optically thin line is dominated by the cloud interior to the shell.	The asymmetries are red or blue depending on whether the shell is moving towards or away from the observer respectively.

doc	A study of density modulation index in the inner heliospheric solar wind during solar cycle 23 EOS The ratio of the rms electron density fluctuations to the background density in the solar wind (density modulation index, _EQN_) is of vital importance in understanding several problems in heliospheric physics related to solar wind turbulence. EOS In this paper, we have investigated the behavior of _EQN_ in the inner-heliosphere from 0.26 to 0.82 AU. EOS The density fluctuations _EQN_ have been deduced using extensive ground-based observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) at 327 MHz, which probe spatial scales of a few hundred km. EOS The background densities (_EQN_) have been derived using near-Earth observations from the Advanced Composition Explorer (_EQN_). EOS Our analysis reveals that _EQN_ and does not vary appreciably with heliocentric distance. EOS We also find that _EQN_ declines by 8% from 1998 to 2008.	We discuss the impact of these findings on problems ranging from our understanding of Forbush decreases to the behavior of the solar wind dynamic pressure over the recent peculiar solar minimum at the end of cycle 23..
doc	Natural Suppression of Proton Decay in Supersymmetric Type III Seesaw Models EOS Supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) has two sources of rapid proton decay: (i) R-parity breaking terms and (ii) higher dimensional Planck induced B-violating terms; EOS its extensions to include neutrino masses via the type I seesaw mechanism need not have the first of these problems due to the existence of B-L as a gauge symmetry but for sure always have the second one. EOS If instead, neutrino masses are explained in a type III seesaw extension of the standard model, an anomaly free gauge symmetry different from B-L is known to exist. EOS In this note, it is shown that a realistic supersymmetric versions of this model can be constructed (MSSM as well as SUSY left-right with type III seesaw) which forbid the R-parity violating couplings of MSSM and suppress Planck scale contributions to proton decay.	The degree of suppression of the latter depends on the weak gauge group.
doc	Synchrotron Emissions in GRB Prompt Phase Using a Semi Leptonic and Hadronic Model EOS In this communication devoted to the prompt emission of GRBs, we claim that some important parameters associated to the magnetic field, such as its index profile, the index of its turbulence spectrum and its level of irregularities, will be measurable with GLAST. EOS In particular the law relating the peak energy Epeak with the total energy E (like Amati's law) constrains the turbulence spectrum index and, among all existing theories of MHD turbulence, is compatible with the Kolmogorov scaling only. EOS Thus, these data will allow a much better determination of the performances of GRBs as particle accelerators.	This opens the possibility to characterize both electron and proton acceleration more seriously.
doc	Monte Carlo simulations of the HP model (the "Ising model" of protein folding) EOS Using Wang-Landau sampling with suitable Monte Carlo trial moves (pull moves and bond-rebridging moves combined) we have determined the density of states and thermodynamic properties for a short sequence of the HP protein model. EOS For free chains these proteins are known to first undergo a collapse "transition" to a globule state followed by a second "transition" into a native state.	When placed in the proximity of an attractive surface, there is a competition between surface adsorption and folding that leads to an intriguing sequence of "transitions".
doc	Expected behaviour of different semiconductor materials in hadron fields EOS The utilisation of semiconductor materials as detectors and devices operating in high radiation environments, at the future particle colliders, in space applications or in medicine and industry, necessitates to obtain radiation harder materials. EOS A systematic theoretical study has been performed, investigating the interaction of charged hadrons with semiconductor materials and the mechanisms of defect creation by irradiation. EOS The mechanisms of the primary interaction of the hadron with the nucleus of the semiconductor lattice have been explicitly modelled and the Lindhard theory of the partition between ionisation and displacements has been considered. EOS The behaviour of silicon, diamond, and some AIIIBV compounds, as GaAs, GaP, InP, InAs, InSb has been investigated.	The nuclear energy loss, and the concentration of primary defects induced in the material bulk by the unit hadron fluence have been calculated.

We present short-cadence, high-resolution out-of-transit H _EQN_ spectra for the hot Jupiter host HD 189733 in order to establish the frequency and magnitude of intrinsic stellar variations in the H _EQN_ line core.
doc	Probing magnetic fields with Square Kilometre array and its precursors EOS Origin of magnetic fields, its structure and effects on dynamical processes in stars to galaxies are not well understood. EOS Lack of a direct probe has hampered its study. EOS The first phase of Square Kilometre Array (SKA-I), will have more than an order of magnitude higher sensitivity than existing radio telescopes. EOS In this contribution, we discuss specific science cases that are of interest to the Indian community concerned with astrophysical turbulence and magnetic fields. EOS The SKA-I will allow observations of a large number of background sources with detectable polarisation and measure their Faraday depths (FDs) through the Milky Way, other galaxies and their circum-galactic medium. EOS This will probe line-of-sight magnetic fields in these objects well and provide field configurations.	Detailed comparison of observational data with models which consider various processes giving rise to field amplification and maintenance will then be possible.

Their fiber spaces are contact manifolds and base spaces are Riemannian manifolds.

EOS Recent studies show that the planet-formation stage of mutual accretion of km-sized planetesimals is most sensitive to binary effects. EOS In this paper, the condition for planetesimal accretion is investigated around Alpha CenB, which is believed to be an ideal candidate for detection of an Earth-like planet in or near its habitable zone(0.5-0.9 AU).	A simplified scaling method is developed to estimate the accretion timescale of the planetesimals embedded in a protoplanetary disk.
doc	Oscillating density of states near zero energy for matrices made of blocks with possible application to the random flux problem EOS We consider random hermitian matrices made of complex blocks. EOS The symmetries of these matrices force them to have pairs of opposite real eigenvalues, so that the average density of eigenvalues must vanish at the origin. EOS These densities are studied for finite _EQN_ matrices in the Gaussian ensemble. EOS In the large _EQN_ limit the density of eigenvalues is given by a semi-circle law. EOS However, near the origin there is a region of size _EQN_ in which this density rises from zero to the semi-circle, going through an oscillatory behavior. EOS This cross-over is calculated explicitly by various techniques. EOS We then show to first order in the non-Gaussian character of the probability distribution that this oscillatory behavior is universal, i.e. EOS independent of the probability distribution. EOS We conjecture that this universality holds to all orders. EOS We then extend our consideration to the more complicated block matrices which arise from lattices of matrices considered in our previous work. EOS Finally, we study the case of random real symmetric matrices made of blocks. EOS By using a remarkable identity we are able to determine the oscillatory behavior in this case also.	The universal oscillations studied here may be applicable to the problem of a particle propagating on a lattice with random magnetic flux.

EOS The corrections inevitably depend on the _EQN_ transition form factors. EOS For the singly virtual transition form factor appearing e.g.	in the bremsstrahlung correction, recent dispersive calculations are used.
doc	Two-batch liar games on a general bounded channel EOS We consider an extension of the 2-person R\'enyi-Ulam liar game in which lies are governed by a channel _EQN_, a set of allowable lie strings of maximum length _EQN_. EOS Carole selects _EQN_, and Paul makes _EQN_ -ary queries to uniquely determine _EQN_. EOS In each of _EQN_ rounds, Paul weakly partitions _EQN_ and asks for _EQN_ such that _EQN_. EOS Carole responds with some _EQN_, and if _EQN_, then _EQN_ accumulates a lie _EQN_. EOS Carole's string of lies for _EQN_ must be in the channel _EQN_. EOS Paul wins if he determines _EQN_ within _EQN_ rounds. EOS We further restrict Paul to ask his questions in two off-line batches. EOS We show that for a range of sizes of the second batch, the maximum size of the search space _EQN_ for which Paul can guarantee finding the distinguished element is _EQN_ as _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the number of lie strings in _EQN_ of maximum length _EQN_. EOS This generalizes previous work of Dumitriu and Spencer, and of Ahlswede, Cicalese, and Deppe.	We extend Paul's strategy to solve also the pathological liar variant, in a unified manner which gives the existence of asymptotically perfect two-batch adaptive codes for the channel _EQN_.

Retardation in propagation of gravity is a central part of the Einstein theory of general relativity which has not been tested directly so far.

doc	Beat-Event Detection in Action Movie Franchises EOS While important advances were recently made towards temporally localizing and recognizing specific human actions or activities in videos, efficient detection and classification of long video chunks belonging to semantically defined categories such as "pursuit" or "romance" remains challenging.We introduce a new dataset, Action Movie Franchises, consisting of a collection of Hollywood action movie franchises. EOS We define 11 non-exclusive semantic categories - called beat-categories - that are broad enough to cover most of the movie footage. EOS The corresponding beat-events are annotated as groups of video shots, possibly overlapping.We propose an approach for localizing beat-events based on classifying shots into beat-categories and learning the temporal constraints between shots. EOS We show that temporal constraints significantly improve the classification performance.	We set up an evaluation protocol for beat-event localization as well as for shot classification, depending on whether movies from the same franchise are present or not in the training data.
doc	Whirling Hexagons and Defect Chaos in Hexagonal Non-Boussinesq Convection EOS We study hexagon patterns in non-Boussinesq convection of a thin rotating layer of water. EOS For realistic parameters and boundary conditions we identify various linear instabilities of the pattern. EOS We focus on the dynamics arising from an oscillatory side-band instability that leads to a spatially disordered chaotic state characterized by oscillating (whirling) hexagons. EOS Using triangulation we obtain the distribution functions for the number of pentagonal and heptagonal convection cells.	In contrast to the results found for defect chaos in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and in inclined-layer convection, the distribution functions can show deviations from a squared Poisson distribution that suggest non-trivial correlations between the defects.
doc	Comparing Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and extended degree: the borderline cases EOS Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and any extended degree function can be thought of as complexity measures for the structure of finitely generated graded modules. EOS A recent result of Doering, Gunston, Vasconcelos shows that both can be compared in case of a graded algebra. EOS We extend this result to modules and analyze when the estimate is in fact an equality.	A complete classification is obtained if we choose as extended degree the homological or the smallest extended degree.
doc	Measurement of Neutral and Charged Current Cross Sections in Electron-Proton Collisions at High Q^2 EOS The inclusive e^-p single and double differential cross sections for neutral and charged current processes are measured with the H1 detector at HERA, in the range of four-momentum transfer squared Q^2 between 150 and 30000 GeV^2, and Bjorken x between 0.002 and 0.65. EOS The data were taken in 1998 and 1999 with a centre-of-mass energy of 320 GeV and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 16.4 pb^(-1). EOS The data are compared with recent measurements of the inclusive neutral and charged current e^+p cross sections. EOS For Q^2>1000 GeV^2 clear evidence is observed for an asymmetry between e^+p and e^-p neutral current scattering and the generalised structure function xF_3 is extracted for the first time at HERA. EOS A fit to the charged current data is used to extract a value for the W boson propagator mass.	The data are found to be in good agreement with Standard Model predictions.
doc	Black holes in modified gravity theories EOS In the context of _EQN_ gravity theories, the issue of finding static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions is addressed. EOS Two approaches to study the existence of such solutions are considered: first, constant curvature solutions, and second, the general case (without imposing constant curvature) is also studied. EOS Performing a perturbative expansion around the Einstein-Hilbert action, it is found that only solutions of the Schwarzschild-(Anti-) de Sitter type are present (up to second order in perturbations) and the explicit expressions for these solutions are provided in terms of the _EQN_ function.	Finally we consider the thermodynamics of black holes in Anti-de Sitter space-time and study their local and global stability.

doc	Exact dynamics of the homogeneous two-qubit _EQN_ central spin model with the spin bath prepared in superpositions of symmetric Dicke states EOS We obtain exact dynamics of a two-qubit central spin model (CSM) consisting of two interacting qubits homogeneously coupled to a spin bath via the _EQN_ -type coupling, with the bath initially prepared in linear superpositions of the symmetric Dicke states. EOS Using the interaction picture Hamiltonian with respect to the non-spin-flipping part of the model, we derive a sequence of equations of motion within each magnetization sector satisfied by the probability amplitudes of the time-evolved state. EOS These equations of motion admit analytical solutions for the single-qubit CSM in which one of the two central qubits decouples from the rest of the system. EOS Based on this, we provide a quantitative interpretation to the observed collapse-revival phenomena in the single-qubit Rabi oscillations when the bath is prepared in the spin coherent state. EOS We then study the disentanglement and coherence dynamics of two initially entangled noninteracting qubits when the two qubits interact with individual baths or with a common bath. EOS For individual baths the coherent dynamics is found to positively correlated to the single-qubit purity dynamics, and entanglement sudden disappearance and revivals are observed in both cases.	The entanglement creation of two initially separable qubits coupled to a common bath is also studied and collapse and revival behaviors in the entanglement dynamics are observed.
doc	The shapes of Milky Way satellites: looking for signatures of tidal stirring EOS We study the shapes of Milky Way satellites in the context of the tidal stirring scenario for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies. EOS The standard procedures used to measure shapes involve smoothing and binning of data and thus may not be sufficient to detect structural properties like bars, which are usually subtle in low surface brightness systems. EOS Taking advantage of the fact that in nearby dwarfs photometry of individual stars is available we introduce discrete measures of shape based on the two-dimensional inertia tensor and the Fourier bar mode. EOS We apply these measures of shape first to a variety of simulated dwarf galaxies formed via tidal stirring of disks embedded in dark matter halos and orbiting the Milky Way. EOS In addition to strong mass loss and randomization of stellar orbits, the disks undergo morphological transformation that typically involves the formation of a triaxial bar after the first pericenter passage. EOS These tidally induced bars persist for a few Gyr before being shortened towards a more spherical shape if the tidal force is strong enough. EOS We test this prediction by measuring in a similar way the shape of nearby dwarf galaxies, satellites of the Milky Way.	We detect inner bars in Ursa Minor, Sagittarius, LMC and possibly Carina.

EOS An analysis of the distribution N(z) of photometric redshifts in a grid of the deep fields of HUDF-FDF-COSMOS-HDFN reveals the possible existence of super large structures with a contrast dN/N~50% and tangential and radial dimensions of about 1000 Mpc.

doc	Calculating Voronoi diagrams using simple chemical reactions EOS This paper overviews work on the use of simple chemical reactions to calculate Voronoi diagrams and undertake other related geometric calculations. EOS This work highlights that this type of specialised chemical processor is a model example of a parallel processor. EOS For example increasing the complexity of the input data within a given area does not increase the computation time. EOS These processors are also able to calculate two or more Voronoi diagrams in parallel. EOS Due to the specific chemical reactions involved and the relative strength of reaction with the substrate (and cross-reactivity with the products) these processors are also capable of calculating Voronoi diagrams sequentially from distinct chemical inputs. EOS The chemical processors are capable of calculating a range of generalised Voronoi diagrams (either from circular drops of chemical or other geometric shapes made from adsorbent substrates soaked in reagent), skeletonisation of planar shapes and weighted Voronoi diagrams (e.g. EOS additively weighted Voronoi diagrams, Multiplicitavely weighted Crystal growth Voronoi diagrams).	The paper will also discuss some limitations of these processors.

We aim to fill this gap by devising two modes of convergence based on a partial order respectively a metric on term graphs.

EOS It is described by a non-linear loop of radiative processes that sets in for high values of the electron compactness and is responsible for the efficient transfer of energy from electrons to photons, predominantly through inverse Compton scatterings. EOS We search for the conditions that drive a magnetized non-thermal source to the inverse Compton catastrophe regime and study its multi-wavelength (MW) photon spectrum.	We develop a generic analytical framework and use numerical calculations as a backup to the analytical predictions.
doc	Quantum man-in-the-middle attack on the calibration process of quantum key distribution EOS Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol has been proved to provide unconditionally secure key between two remote legitimate users in theory. EOS Key distribution signals are transmitted in a quantum channel which is established by the calibration process to meet the requirement of high count rate and low error rate. EOS All QKD security proofs implicitly assume that the quantum channel has been established securely. EOS However, the eavesdropper may attack the calibration process to break the security assumption of QKD and provide precondition to steal information about the final key successfully. EOS Inspired by N. EOS Jain et al, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett.107,110501(2011), we reveal the security risk of the calibration process of a passive-basis-choice BB84 QKD system by launching a quantum man-in-the-middle attack which intercepts all calibration signals and resends faked ones. EOS Large temporal bit-dependent or basis-dependent detector efficiency mismatch can be induced. EOS Then we propose a basis-dependent detector efficiency mismatch (BEM) based faked states attack on a single photon BB84 QKD to stress the threat of BEM.	Moreover, the security of single photon QKD systems with BEM is studied simply and intuitively.

EOS In this paper we overcome this restriction, by proposing a framework based on a deep convolutional neural network, SOMAnet, that additionally models other discriminative aspects, namely, structural attributes of the human figure (e.g. EOS height, obesity, gender). EOS Our method is unique in many respects. EOS First, SOMAnet is based on the Inception architecture, departing from the usual siamese framework. EOS This spares expensive data preparation (pairing images across cameras) and allows the understanding of what the network learned. EOS Second, and most notably, the training data consists of a synthetic 100K instance dataset, SOMAset, created by photorealistic human body generation software. EOS Synthetic data represents a good compromise between realistic imagery, usually not required in re-identification since surveillance cameras capture low-resolution silhouettes, and complete control of the samples, which is useful in order to customize the data w.r.t. EOS the surveillance scenario at-hand, e.g. EOS ethnicity.	SOMAnet, trained on SOMAset and fine-tuned on recent re-identification benchmarks, outperforms all competitors, matching subjects even with different apparel.
doc	Epimorphisms, definability and cardinalities EOS Generalizing a theorem of Campercholi, we characterize, in syntactic terms, the ranges of epimorphisms in an arbitrary class of similar first-order structures (as opposed to an elementary class).	This allows us to strengthen a result of Isbell, as follows: in any prevariety having at most s non-logical symbols and an axiomatization requiring at most m variables, if the epimorphisms into structures with at most m + s + aleph0 elements are surjective, then so are all of the epimorphisms.
doc	Deep Generative Model using Unregularized Score for Anomaly Detection with Heterogeneous Complexity EOS Accurate and automated detection of anomalous samples in a natural image dataset can be accomplished with a probabilistic model for end-to-end modeling of images. EOS Such images have heterogeneous complexity, however, and a probabilistic model overlooks simply shaped objects with small anomalies. EOS This is because the probabilistic model assigns undesirably lower likelihoods to complexly shaped objects that are nevertheless consistent with set standards.	To overcome this difficulty, we propose an unregularized score for deep generative models (DGMs), which are generative models leveraging deep neural networks.

doc	A method of `speed coefficients' for biochemical model reduction applied to the NF-kappaB system EOS The relationship between components of biochemical network and the resulting dynamics of the overall system is a key focus of computational biology. EOS However, as these networks and resulting mathematical models are inherently complex and non-linear, the understanding of this relationship becomes challenging. EOS Among many approaches, model reduction methods provide an avenue to extract components responsible for the key dynamical features of the system.	Unfortunately, these approaches often require intuition to apply.
doc	Decay of plasmonic waves in Josephson junction chains EOS We study the damping of plasma waves in linear Josephson junction chains as well as in two capacitively coupled chains. EOS In the parameter regime where the ground capacitance can be neglected, the theory of the antisymmetric mode in the double chain can be mapped onto the theory of a single chain. EOS We consider two sources of relaxation: the scattering from quantum phase slips (QPS) and the interaction among plasmons related to the nonlinearity of the Josephson potential. EOS The contribution to the relaxation rate _EQN_ from the nonlinearity scales with the fourth power of frequency _EQN_, while the phase-slip contribution behaves as a power law with a non-universal exponent.	In the parameter regime where the charging energy related to the junction capacitance is much smaller than the Josephson energy, the amplitude of QPS is strongly suppressed.
doc	Magnetic reordering in the vicinity of a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic interface EOS The magnetic arrangement in the vicinity of the interface between a ferromagnet and an antiferromagnet is investigated, in particular its dependence on the exchange couplings and the temperature. EOS Applying a Heisenberg model, both sc(001) and fcc(001) lattices are considered and solved by a mean field approximation. EOS Depending on the parameter values a variety of different magnetic configurations emerge.	Usually the subsystem with the larger ordering temperature induces a magnetic order into the other one (magnetic proximity effect).

doc	Measuring the Algorithmic Efficiency of Neural Networks EOS Three factors drive the advance of AI: algorithmic innovation, data, and the amount of compute available for training. EOS Algorithmic progress has traditionally been more difficult to quantify than compute and data. EOS In this work, we argue that algorithmic progress has an aspect that is both straightforward to measure and interesting: reductions over time in the compute needed to reach past capabilities. EOS We show that the number of floating-point operations required to train a classifier to AlexNet-level performance on ImageNet has decreased by a factor of 44x between 2012 and 2019.	This corresponds to algorithmic efficiency doubling every 16 months over a period of 7 years.
doc	Very Wide Binaries and Other Comoving Stellar Companions: A Bayesian Analysis of the Hipparcos Catalogue EOS We develop Bayesian statistical methods for discovering and assigning probabilities to non-random (e.g., physical) stellar companions. EOS These companions are either presently bound or were previously bound. EOS The probabilities depend on similarities in corrected proper motion parallel and perpendicular to the brighter component's motion, parallax, and the local phase-space density of field stars. EOS Control experiments are conducted to understand the behavior of false positives. EOS The technique is applied to the Hipparcos Catalogue within 100 pc. EOS This is the first all-sky survey to locate escaped companions still drifting along with each other. EOS In the <100 pc distance range, ~220 high probability companions with separations between 0.01 - 1 pc are found. EOS The first evidence for a population (~300) of companions separated by 1 - 8 pc is found. EOS We find these previously unnoticed naked-eye companions (both with V<6th mag): Capella & 50 Per, delta Vel & HIP 43797, Alioth (epsilon UMa), Megrez (delta UMa) & Alcor (80 UMA), gamma & tau Cen, phi Eri & eta Hor, 62 & 63 Cnc, gamma & tau Per, zeta & delta Hya, beta01, beta02 & beta03 Tuc, N Vel & HIP 47479, HIP 98174 & HIP 97646, 44 & 58 Oph, s Eri & HIP 14913, and pi & rho Cep.	High probability fainter companions (V > 6th mag) of primaries with V < 4th mag are found for: Fomalhaut (alpha PsA), gamma UMa, alpha Lib, Alvahet (iota Cephi), delta Ara, beta Ser, iota Peg, beta Pic, kappa Phe and gamma Tuc.
doc	Towards Robust Monocular Depth Estimation: Mixing Datasets for Zero-shot Cross-dataset Transfer EOS The success of monocular depth estimation relies on large and diverse training sets. EOS Due to the challenges associated with acquiring dense ground-truth depth across different environments at scale, a number of datasets with distinct characteristics and biases have emerged. EOS We develop tools that enable mixing multiple datasets during training, even if their annotations are incompatible. EOS In particular, we propose a robust training objective that is invariant to changes in depth range and scale, advocate the use of principled multi-objective learning to combine data from different sources, and highlight the importance of pretraining encoders on auxiliary tasks. EOS Armed with these tools, we experiment with five diverse training datasets, including a new, massive data source: 3D films. EOS To demonstrate the generalization power of our approach we use zero-shot cross-dataset transfer, i.e. EOS we evaluate on datasets that were not seen during training. EOS The experiments confirm that mixing data from complementary sources greatly improves monocular depth estimation. EOS Our approach clearly outperforms competing methods across diverse datasets, setting a new state of the art for monocular depth estimation.	Some results are shown in the supplementary video at https://youtu.be/D46FzVyL9I8
doc	DNA like _EQN_ charge attraction and overcharging by divalent counterions in the presence of divalent co _EQN_ ions EOS Strongly correlated electrostatics of DNA systems has drawn the interest of many groups, especially the condensation and overcharging of DNA by multivalent counterions. EOS By adding counterions of different valencies and shapes, one can enhance or reduce DNA overcharging. EOS In this papers, we focus on the effect of multivalent co-ions, specifically divalent co-ions such as SO _EQN_. EOS A computational experiment of DNA condensation using Monte _EQN_ Carlo simulation in grand canonical ensemble is carried out where DNA system is in equilibrium with a bulk solution containing a mixture of salt of different valency of co-ions. EOS Compared to system with purely monovalent co-ions, the influence of divalent co-ions shows up in multiple aspects. EOS Divalent co-ions lead to an increase of monovalent salt in the DNA condensate.	Because monovalent salts mostly participate in linear screening of electrostatic interactions in the system, more monovalent salt molecules enter the condensate leads to screening out of short-range DNA _EQN_ DNA like charge attraction and weaker DNA condensation free energy.
doc	Palindromic Subsequences in Finite Words EOS In 1999 Lyngs \o and Pedersen proposed a conjecture stating that every binary circular word of length _EQN_ with equal number of zeros and ones has an antipalindromic linear subsequence of length at least _EQN_. EOS No progress over a trivial _EQN_ bound has been achieved since then. EOS We suggest a palindromic counterpart to this conjecture and provide a non-trivial infinite series of circular words which prove the upper bound of _EQN_ for both conjectures at the same time. EOS The construction also works for words over an alphabet of size _EQN_ and gives rise to a generalization of the conjecture by Lyngs \o and Pedersen.	Moreover, we discuss some possible strengthenings and weakenings of the named conjectures.

EOS Conservation laws and properties of the stationary solutions are determined. EOS Quantum effects are shown to manifest themselves in transient periodic oscillations of the averaged Wigner function in velocity space. EOS The quantum quasilinear theory is checked against numerical simulations of the bump-on-tail and the two-stream instabilities.	The predicted wavelength of the oscillations in velocity space agrees well with the numerical results.
doc	Improving spatial resolution in X-ray microscopy by using tilted angle detector: A simulation study EOS Conventional x-ray imaging detectors suffer from parallax error when the radiation beam arrives at the detector surface at tilted angle. EOS The image blurring occurs as the radiation penetrates detector material in lateral direction at tilted angle.	However, at the photon energies used in x-ray microscopy the attenuation length of the x-rays in the detector material is shorter and consequently the parallax error due to the tilted angle irradiation can be smaller.
doc	Switching of magnetism via modifying phase shift of quantum-well states by tailoring the interface electronic structure EOS We demonstrate control of the magnetism of Pd(100) ultrathin films, which show d-electron quantum-well induced ferromagnetism, via modulation of the interface electronic state using density functional calculation. EOS From an analysis based on the phase model, forming the Au/Pd(100) interface induces hybridization of the wave function of d-electron quantum-well states, and modulates the term of the scattering phase shift as a function of the reciprocal lattice point. EOS In contrast, forming the Al interface, which has only s-electrons at the Fermi energy, cannot modify the scattering phase shift.	Our finding indicates the possibility of modifying the phase shift by tailoring the interface electronic states using hybridization of the wave function, and this efficiently changes the density of states near the Fermi energy of Pd films, and the switching between paramagnetism and ferromagnetism occurs based on the condition for ferromagnetism (Stoner criterion).

The distinguishing feature of this work is that in the formulation of the Riemann-Hilbert problem no specific relationship is assumed between the Toeplitz and Hankel symbols.
doc	A critical assessment of two-body and three-body interactions in water EOS The microscopic behavior of water under different conditions and in different environments remains the subject of intense debate. EOS A great number of the controversies arise due to the contradictory predictions obtained within different theoretical models. EOS Relative to conclusions derived from force fields or density functional theory, there is comparably less room to dispute highly-correlated electronic structure calculations. EOS Unfortunately, such ab initio calculations are severely limited by system size. EOS In this study, a detailed analysis of the two- and three-body water interactions evaluated at the CCSD(T) level is carried out to quantitatively assess the accuracy of several force fields, density functional theory, and ab initio-based interaction potentials that are commonly used in molecular simulations. EOS Based on this analysis, a new model, HBB2-pol, is introduced which is capable of accurately mapping CCSD(T) results for water dimers and trimers into an efficient analytical function.	The accuracy of HBB2-pol is further established through comparison with the experimentally determined second and third virial coefficients.

This system hosts the most luminous cool core of any nearby group and exhibits active radio mode feedback from the super-massive black hole in its brightest group galaxy, IC 4374.
doc	Global Solvability in Functional Spaces for Smooth Nonsingular Vector Fields in the Plane EOS We address some global solvability issues for classes of smooth nonsingular vector fields _EQN_ in the plane related to cohomological equations _EQN_ in geometry and dynamical systems. EOS The first main result is that _EQN_ is not surjective in _EQN_ iff the geometrical condition -- the existence of separatrix strips -- holds.	Next, for nonsurjective vector fields, we demonstrate that if the RHS _EQN_ has at most infra-exponential growth in the separatrix strips we can find a global weak solution _EQN_ near the boundaries of the separatrix strips.
doc	Chemical Potential of Integer Electron Systems EOS A truly isolated atom always has an integer number of electrons. EOS If placed in contact with a far-away metallic reservoir, a range of metallic chemical potentials _EQN_ will lead to an identical number of electrons, _EQN_, on the atom. EOS We formulate a density embedding method in which the range of _EQN_ leading to integer _EQN_ decreases due to finite-distance interactions between the metal and the atom. EOS The typical _EQN_ staircase function is smoothed out due to these finite-distance interactions, resembling finite-temperature effects. EOS Fractional occupations on the atom occur only for sharply-defined _EQN_ 's. EOS We illustrate the new method with the simplest model system designed to mimic an atom near a metal surface.	Because calculating fractional charges is important in various fields, from electrolysis to catalysis, solar cells and organic electronics, we anticipate several potential uses of the proposed approach.

doc	Dynamic instability of a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate EOS We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate subject to a rotating harmonic potential, in connection with recent experiments leading to the formation of vortices. EOS We use the classical hydrodynamic approximation to the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation to determine almost analytically the evolution of the condensate. EOS We predict that this evolution can exhibit dynamical instabilities, for the stirring procedure previously demonstrated at ENS and for a new stirring procedure that we put forward.	These instabilities take place within the range of stirring frequency and amplitude for which vortices are produced experimentally.

doc	Spatio-temporal interference of photo electron wave packets and time scale of non-adiabatic transition in high-frequency regime EOS The method of the envelope Hamiltonian [K. EOS Toyota, U. EOS Saalmann, and J. EOS M. EOS Rost, New J. EOS Phys. EOS 17, 073005~(2015)] is applied to further study a detachment dynamics of a model negative ion in one-dimension in high-frequency regime. EOS This method is based on the Floquet approach, but the time-dependency of an envelope function is explicitly kept for arbitrary pulse durations. EOS Therefore, it is capable of describing not only a photo absorption/emission but also a non-adiabatic transition which is induced by the time-varying envelope of the pulse. EOS It was shown that the envelope Hamiltonian accurately retrieves the results obtained by the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, and underlying physics were well understood by the adiabatic approximation based on the envelope Hamiltonian. EOS In this paper, we further explore two more aspects of the detachment dynamics, which were not done in our previous work. EOS First, we find out features of both a spatial and temporal interference of photo electron wave packets in a photo absorption process. EOS We conclude that both the interference mechanisms are universal in ionization dynamics in high-frequency regime. EOS To our knowledge, it is first time that both the interference mechanisms in high-frequency regime are extracted from the first principle.	Second, we extract a pulse duration which maximize a yield of the non-adiabatic transition as a function of a pulse duration.
doc	Roughness effects in laminar pipe flow EOS The impact of wall roughness on fully developed laminar pipe flow is investigated numerically. EOS The roughness is comprised of square bars of varying size and pitch. EOS Results show that the inverse relation between the friction factor and the Reynolds number in smooth pipes still persists in rough pipes, regardless of the rib height and pitch. EOS At a given Reynolds number, the friction factor varies quadratically with roughness height and linearly with roughness pitch.	We propose a single correlation for the friction factor that successfully collapses the data.

EOS Beyond local density approximation, the generalized gradient approximations(GGAs) are designed using reduced density gradient as main ingredient. EOS An enhancement factor is constructed using the inhomogeneity parameter of GGAs by taking care of the low and high density behaviors of it. EOS Thus, the exchange energy functional proposed by making use of the aforementioned enhancement factor, significantly reduces the error compare to the previously proposed gradient approximations. EOS Another enhancement factor and corresponding energy functional is also constructed using the inhomogeneity parameter originally introduced by Becke [J. EOS Chem.	Phys.
doc	Simple approximate analytical solution for non-isothermal single-step transformations: kinetic analysis EOS In this paper, we develop a method for obtaining the approximate solution for the evolution of single-step transformations under non-isothermal conditions. EOS We have applied it to many reaction models and obtained very simple analytical expressions for the shape of the corresponding transformation rate peaks. EOS These analytical solutions represent a significant simplification of the system's description allowing easy curve fitting to experiment. EOS A remarkable property is that the evolutions of the transformed fraction obtained at different heating rates are identical when time is scaled by a time constant.	The accuracy achieved with our method is checked against several reaction models and different temperature dependencies of the transformation rate constant.
doc	A comparative study between a failed and a successful eruption initiated from the same polarity inversion line in AR 11387 EOS In this paper, we analyzed a failed and a successful eruption that initiated from the same polarity inversion line within NOAA AR 11387 on December 25, 2011. EOS They both started from a reconnection between sheared arcades, having distinct pre-eruption conditions and eruption details: before the failed one, the magnetic fields of the core region had a weaker non-potentiality; EOS the external fields had a similar critical height for torus instability, a similar local torus-stable region, but a larger magnetic flux ratio (of low corona and near-surface region) as compared to the successful one. EOS During the failed eruption, a smaller Lorentz force impulse was exerted on the outward ejecta; EOS the ejecta had a much slower rising speed. EOS Factors that might lead to the initiation of the failed eruption are identified: 1) a weaker non-potentiality of the core region, and a smaller Lorentz force impulse gave the ejecta a small momentum;	2) the large flux ratio, and the local torus-stable region in the corona provided strong confinements that made the erupting structure regain an equilibrium state.

EOS Here, we present the Automated Recommendation Tool (ART), a tool that leverages machine learning and probabilistic modeling techniques to guide synthetic biology in a systematic fashion, without the need for a full mechanistic understanding of the biological system.	Using sampling-based optimization, ART provides a set of recommended strains to be built in the next engineering cycle, alongside probabilistic predictions of their production levels.

It turned out that "ex-situ" prepared wire (x = 0) has considerable disadvantages compared to all the other wires in which "in-situ" assisted (0 < x < 1) or pure "in-situ" (x = 1) preparation was used due to weaker inter-grain connectivity.

EOS Theoretical interpretation of the water anomalies could then be based on simulation results of well validated water models.	But the analysis of the simulations has not yet reached a consensus.
doc	State Transfer Between a Mechanical Oscillator and Microwave Fields in the Quantum Regime EOS Recently, macroscopic mechanical oscillators have been coaxed into a regime of quantum behavior, by direct refrigeration  or a combination of refrigeration and laser-like cooling [2, 3]. EOS This exciting result has encouraged notions that mechanical oscillators may perform useful functions in the processing of quantum information with superconducting circuits [1, 4-7], either by serving as a quantum memory for the ephemeral state of a microwave field or by providing a quantum interface between otherwise incompatible systems [8, 9]. EOS As yet, the transfer of an itinerant state or propagating mode of a microwave field to and from a mechanical oscillator has not been demonstrated owing to the inability to agilely turn on and off the interaction between microwave electricity and mechanical motion. EOS Here we demonstrate that the state of an itinerant microwave field can be coherently transferred into, stored in, and retrieved from a mechanical oscillator with amplitudes at the single quanta level.	Crucially, the time to capture and to retrieve the microwave state is shorter than the quantum state lifetime of the mechanical oscillator.

doc	Towards a theory of assembly of protein complexes: lessons from equilibrium statistical physics EOS Cellular functions are established through biological evolution, but are constrained by the laws of physics. EOS For instance, the physics of protein folding limits the lengths of cellular polypeptide chains. EOS Consequently, many cellular functions are carried out not by long, isolated proteins, but rather by multi-protein complexes. EOS Protein complexes themselves do not escape physical constraints, one of the most important being the difficulty to assemble reliably in the presence of cellular noise. EOS In order to lay the foundation for a theory of reliable protein complex assembly, we study here an equilibrium thermodynamic model of self-assembly that exhibits four distinct assembly behaviors: diluted protein solution, liquid mixture, "chimeric assembly" and "multifarious assembly". EOS In the latter regime, different protein complexes can coexist without forming erroneous chimeric structures.	We show that two conditions have to be fulfilled to attain this regime: (i) the composition of the complexes needs to be sufficiently heterogeneous, and (ii) the use of the set of components by the complexes has to be sparse.

EOS We measure the eta_b(1S) mass to be (9401.0+-1.9+1.4-2.4)MeV/c^2 with a width of (12.4+5.5-4.6+11.5-3.4)MeV and a decay branching fraction of BF[h_b(1P)->eta_b(1S)gamma]=(49.8+-6.8+10.9-5.2)%. EOS The measured eta_b(1S) mass corresponds to a hyperfine splitting of (59.3+-1.9+2.4-1.4)MeV/c^2.	This value deviates significantly from the current world average obtained from measurements of Upsilon(3S)->eta_b(1S)gamma and Upsilon(2S)->eta_b(1S)gamma reactions.

doc	A Functional Complexity Framework for the Analysis of Telecommunication Networks EOS The rapid evolution of network services demands new paradigms for studying and designing networks. EOS In order to understand the underlying mechanisms that provide network functions, we propose a framework which enables the functional analysis of telecommunication networks. EOS This framework allows us to isolate and analyse a network function as a complex system. EOS We propose functional topologies to visualise the relationships between system entities and enable the systematic study of interactions between them. EOS We also define a complexity metric _EQN_ (functional complexity) which quantifies the variety of structural patterns and roles of nodes in the topology. EOS This complexity metric provides a wholly new approach to study the operation of telecommunication networks. EOS We study the relationship between _EQN_ and different graph structures by analysing graph theory metrics in order to recognize complex organisations. EOS _EQN_ is equal to zero for both a full mesh topology and a disconnected topology. EOS We show that complexity is very high for a dense structure that shows high integration (shorter average path length and high average clustering coefficient).	We make a connection between functional complexity, robustness and response to changes that may appear in the system configuration.

doc	Light-Front Quantization and AdS/QCD: An Overview EOS We give an overview of the light-front holographic approach to strongly coupled QCD, whereby a confining gauge theory, quantized on the light front, is mapped to a higher-dimensional anti de Sitter (AdS) space. EOS The framework is guided by the AdS/CFT correspondence incorporating a gravitational background asymptotic to AdS space which encodes the salient properties of QCD, such as the ultraviolet conformal limit at the AdS boundary at _EQN_, as well as modifications of the geometry in the large _EQN_ infrared region to describe confinement and linear Regge behavior. EOS There are two equivalent procedures for deriving the AdS/QCD equations of motion: one can start from the Hamiltonian equation of motion in physical space time by studying the off-shell dynamics of the bound state wavefunctions as a function of the invariant mass of the constituents. EOS To a first semiclassical approximation, where quantum loops and quark masses are not included, this leads to a light-front Hamiltonian equation which describes the bound state dynamics of light hadrons in terms of an invariant impact variable _EQN_ which measures the separation of the partons within the hadron at equal light-front time. EOS Alternatively, one can start from the gravity side by studying the propagation of hadronic modes in a fixed effective gravitational background.	Both approaches are equivalent in the semiclassical approximation.

doc	Human Action Recognition Using Deep Multilevel Multimodal (M2) Fusion of Depth and Inertial Sensors EOS Multimodal fusion frameworks for Human Action Recognition (HAR) using depth and inertial sensor data have been proposed over the years. EOS In most of the existing works, fusion is performed at a single level (feature level or decision level), missing the opportunity to fuse rich mid-level features necessary for better classification. EOS To address this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose three novel deep multilevel multimodal fusion frameworks to capitalize on different fusion strategies at various stages and to leverage the superiority of multilevel fusion. EOS At input, we transform the depth data into depth images called sequential front view images (SFIs) and inertial sensor data into signal images.	Each input modality, depth and inertial, is further made multimodal by taking convolution with the Prewitt filter.
doc	Inter-Cell Antenna Calibration for Coherent Joint Transmission in TDD System EOS In this work the modeling and calibration method of reciprocity error in a coherent TDD coordinated multi-point (CoMP) joint transmission (JT) system are addressed. EOS The modeling includes parameters such as amplitude gains and phase differences of RF chains between the eNBs. EOS The calibration method used for inter-cell antenna calibration is based on precoding matrix indicator (PMI) feedback by UE. EOS Furthermore, we provide some simulation results for evaluating the performance of the calibration method in different cases such as varying estimation-period, cell-specific reference signals (CRS) ports configuration, signal to noise ratio (SNR), phase difference, etc. EOS The main conclusion is that the proposed method for intercell antenna calibration has good performance for estimating the residual phase difference.

doc	The sulfur depletion problem: upper limits on the H2S2, HS2, and S2 gas-phase abundances toward the low-mass warm core IRAS16293-2422 EOS A fraction of the missing sulfur in dense clouds and circumstellar regions could be in the form of three species not yet de- tected in the interstellar medium: H2S2, HS2, and S2 according to experimental simulations performed under astrophysically relevant conditions. EOS These S-S bonded molecules can be formed by the energetic processing of H2S-bearing ice mantles on dust grains, and subsequently desorb to the gas phase. EOS The detection of these species could partially solve the sulfur depletion problem, and would help to improve our knowledge of the poorly known chemistry of sulfur in the interstellar medium. EOS To this purpose we performed dedicated ground-based observations toward the low-mass warm core IRAS16293-2422.	Observations in the submillimeter regime were obtained with the APEX 12 m telescope during 15 hours of observation, targeting a wide selection of the predicted rotational transitions of the three molecules.

doc	Multilinear Operators on Weighted Amalgam-Type Spaces EOS In this paper, we prove that if a multilinear operator _EQN_ and its multilinear commutator _EQN_ and iterated commutator _EQN_ for _EQN_ are bounded on product weighted Lebesgue space, then _EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_ are also bounded on product weighted Amalgam space. EOS As its applications, we show that multilinear Littlewood-Paley functions and multilinear Marcinkiewicz integral functions with kernels of convolution type and non-convolution type, and their multilinear commutators and iterated commutators are bounded on product weighted Amalgam space. EOS We also consider multilinear fractional type integral operators and their commutators' behaviors on weighted amalgam space. EOS In order to deal with the endpoint case, we introduce the amalgam-Campanato space and show that fractional integral integral operator are bounded operators from product amalgam space to amalgam-Campanato space.	What should point out is that even if in the linear case, our results for fractional integral operator are also new.
doc	Cosmic ray transport in galaxy clusters: implications for radio halos, gamma-ray signatures, and cool core heating EOS We investigate the interplay of cosmic ray (CR) propagation and advection in galaxy clusters. EOS Propagation in form of CR diffusion and streaming tends to drive the CR radial profiles towards being flat, with equal CR number density everywhere. EOS Advection of CR by the turbulent gas motions tends to produce centrally enhanced profiles. EOS We assume that the CR streaming velocity is of the order of the sound velocity. EOS This is motivated by plasma physical arguments. EOS The CR streaming is then usually larger than typical advection velocities and becomes comparable or lower than this only for periods with trans- and super-sonic cluster turbulence. EOS As a consequence a bimodality of the CR spatial distribution results. EOS Strongly turbulent, merging clusters should have a more centrally concentrated CR energy density profile with respect to relaxed ones with very subsonic turbulence. EOS This translates into a bimodality of the expected diffuse radio and gamma-ray emission of clusters, since more centrally concentrated CR will find higher target densities for hadronic CR proton interactions, higher plasma wave energy densities for CR electron and proton re-acceleration, and stronger magnetic fields. EOS Thus, the observed bimodality of cluster radio halos appears to be a natural consequence of the interplay of CR transport processes, independent of the model of radio halo formation, be it hadronic interactions of CR protons or re-acceleration of low-energy CR electrons.	Energy dependence of the CR propagation should lead to spectral steepening of dying radio halos.
doc	Intensity Mapping as a Probe of Axion Dark Matter EOS Intensity mapping (IM) of spectral lines has the potential to revolutionize cosmology by increasing the total number of observed modes by several orders of magnitude compared to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. EOS In this paper, we consider IM of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the redshift range _EQN_ employing a halo model approach where HI is assumed to follow the distribution of dark matter (DM) halos. EOS If a portion of the DM is composed of ultralight axions then the abundance of halos is changed compared to cold dark matter below the axion Jeans mass. EOS With fixed total HI density, _EQN_, assumed to reside entirely in halos, this effect introduces a scale-independent increase in the HI power spectrum on scales above the axion Jeans scale, which our model predicts consistent with N-body simulations. EOS Lighter axions introduce a scale-dependent feature even on linear scales due to its suppression of the matter power spectrum near the Jeans scale.	We use the Fisher matrix formalism to forecast the ability of future HI surveys to constrain the axion fraction of DM and marginalize over astrophysical and model uncertainties.

doc	QCD-aware partonic jet clustering for truth-jet flavour labelling EOS We present an algorithm for deriving partonic flavour labels to be applied to truth particle jets in Monte Carlo event simulations. EOS The inputs to this approach are final pre-hadronization partons, to remove dependence on unphysical details such as the order of matrix element calculation and shower generator frame recoil treatment. EOS These are clustered using standard jet algorithms, modified to restrict the allowed pseudojet combinations to those in which tracked flavour labels are consistent with QCD and QED Feynman rules. EOS The resulting algorithm is shown to be portable between the major families of shower generators, and largely insensitive to many possible systematic variations: it hence offers significant advantages over existing ad hoc labelling schemes.	However, it is shown that contamination from multi-parton scattering simulations can disrupt the labelling results.
doc	Calibrating laser test-beams for cosmic-ray observatories EOS Pulsed UV lasers can provide useful "testbeams" for observatories that use optical detectors, especially fluorescence detectors, to measure high energy cosmic-rays.

doc	Large Cosmological Light Element Bound on R Parity Violating Parameters EOS In R parity violating theories, there does not exist the stable lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). EOS The LSP, _EQN_, of MSSM decays to lighter ordinary particles with dimension 6 effective R violating interaction terms. EOS Since the lifetime of _EQN_ can be sufficiently long for small R-violating couplings, it can affect the standard nucleosynthesis scenario. EOS This constraint gives an upper limit for the lifetime of _EQN_ in the small _EQN_ region;	_EQN_ s.
doc	Modeling and Mitigating Human Annotation Errors to Design Efficient Stream Processing Systems with Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning EOS High-quality human annotations are necessary for creating effective machine learning-driven stream processing systems. EOS We study hybrid stream processing systems based on a Human-In-The-Loop Machine Learning (HITL-ML) paradigm, in which one or many human annotators and an automatic classifier (trained at least partially by the human annotators) label an incoming stream of instances. EOS This is typical of many near-real time social media analytics and web applications, including the annotation of social media posts during emergencies by digital volunteer groups. EOS From a practical perspective, low-quality human annotations result in wrong labels for retraining automated classifiers and indirectly contribute to the creation of inaccurate classifiers. EOS Considering human annotation as a psychological process allows us to address these limitations. EOS We show that human annotation quality is dependent on the ordering of instances shown to annotators, and can be improved by local changes in the instance sequence/ordering provided to the annotators, yielding a more accurate annotation of the stream. EOS We design a theoretically-motivated human error framework for the human annotation task to study the effect of ordering instances (i.e., an "annotation schedule"). EOS Further, we propose an error-avoidance approach to the active learning (HITL-ML) paradigm for stream processing applications that is robust to these likely human errors when deciding a human annotation schedule.	We validate the human error framework using crowdsourcing experiments and evaluate the proposed algorithm against standard baselines for active learning via extensive experimentation on classification tasks of filtering relevant social media posts during natural disasters.
doc	Quantum simulation of rainbow gravity by nonlocal nonlinearity EOS Rainbow gravity modifies general relativity by introducing an energy dependent metric, which is expected to have a role in the quantum theory of black holes and in quantum gravity at Planck energy scale. EOS We show that rainbow gravity can be simulated in the laboratory by nonlinear waves in nonlocal media, as those occurring in Bose-condensed gases and nonlinear optics.	We reveal that at a classical level, a nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation may emulate the curved space time in proximity of a rotating black hole as dictated by the rainbow gravity scenario.
doc	Entanglement Content of Quasi-Particle Excitations EOS We investigate the quantum entanglement content of quasi-particle excitations in extended many-body systems.

It is largely independent of the momenta and masses of the excitations, and of the geometry, dimension and connectedness of the entanglement region.
doc	Secondary Spectrum Auctions for Symmetric and Submodular Bidders EOS We study truthful auctions for secondary spectrum usage in wireless networks. EOS In this scenario, n communication requests need to be allocated to k available channels that are subject to interference and noise.

Our approach to model interference uses an edge-weighted conflict graph, and our algorithms provide asymptotically almost optimal approximation bounds for conflict graphs with a small inductive independence number rho << n.
doc	Topological pressure via saddle points EOS Let _EQN_ be a compact locally maximal invariant set of a _EQN_ -diffeomorphism _EQN_ on a smooth Riemannian manifold _EQN_. EOS In this paper we study the topological pressure _EQN_ (with respect to the dynamical system _EQN_) for a wide class of H\"older continuous potentials and analyze its relation to dynamical, as well as geometrical, properties of the system. EOS We show that under a mild nonuniform hyperbolicity assumption the topological pressure of _EQN_ is entirely determined by the values of _EQN_ on the saddle points of _EQN_ in _EQN_. EOS Moreover, it is enough to consider saddle points with ``large'' Lyapunov exponents.	We also introduce a version of the pressure for certain non-continuous potentials and establish several variational inequalities for it.

EOS Our algorithm takes MRI data as input, performs several preprocessing and intermediate steps, and then returns each of the two calculated volumes.	To simplify this process and make our algorithm publicly accessible to anyone, we have created a web-based interface that allows users to upload their own MRI data and calculate the TBV and ICV for the given data.

doc	The truncated disk from Suzaku data of GX 339-4 in the extreme very high state EOS We report on the geometry of accretion disk and high energy coronae in the strong Comptonization state (the very high/steep power law/hard intermediate state) based on a Suzaku observation of the famous Galactic black hole GX 339-4. EOS These data were taken just before the peak of the 2006-2007 outburst, and the average X-ray luminosity in the 0.7-200 keV band is estimated to be 2.9E38 erg/s for a distance of 8 kpc. EOS We fit the spectrum with both simple (independent disk and corona) and sophisticated (energetically coupled disk and corona) models, but all fits imply that the underlying optically thick disk is truncated significantly before the innermost stable circular orbit around the black hole. EOS We show this directly by a comparison with similarly broadband data from a disk dominated spectrum at almost the same luminosity observed by XMM-Newton and RXTE 3 days after the Suzaku observation. EOS During the Suzaku observation, the QPO frequency changes from 4.3 Hz to 5.5 Hz, while the spectrum softens. EOS The energetically coupled model gives a corresponding 5+/- 8 % decrease in derived inner radius of the disk.	While this is not significant, it is consistent with the predicted change in QPO frequency from Lense-Thirring precession of the hot flow interior to the disk and/or a deformation mode of this flow, as a higher QPO frequency implies a smaller size scale for the corona.

EOS For large field values, where the inflationary phase takes place, all these classes of models are indeed identical to the Starobinsky model.	Nevertheless, the inflaton is just an auxiliary field in the Jordan frame of the Starobinsky model and this leads to two important consequences: first, the inflationary predictions of the Starobinsky model and its descendants are slightly different (albeit not measurably);
doc	Coupled Optical Resonance Laser Lockin EOS We have demonstrated simultaneous laser frequency stabilization of a UV and IR laser, to the same spectroscopic sample, by monitoring only the absorption of the UV laser. EOS For trapping and cooling Yb _EQN_ ions, a frequency stabilized laser is required at 369.95nm to drive the _EQN_ _EQN_ _EQN_ cooling transition. EOS Since the cycle is not closed, a 935.18nm laser is needed to drive the _EQN_ _EQN_ _EQN_ transition which is followed by rapid decay to the _EQN_ state. EOS Our 369nm laser is locked to Yb _EQN_ ions generated in a hollow cathode discharge lamp using saturated absorption spectroscopy. EOS Without pumping, the metastable _EQN_ level is only sparsely populated and direct absorption of 935nm light is difficult to detect. EOS A resonant 369nm laser is able to significantly populate the _EQN_ state due to the coupling between the levels.	Fast re-pumping to the _EQN_ state, by 935nm light, can be detected by observing the change in absorption of the 369nm laser using lock-in detection of the photodiode signal.

This approach is guaranteed to accurately predict M linear functions with bounded Hilbert-Schmidt norm from only order of log(M) measurements.

doc	In situ apparatus for the study of clathrate hydrates relevant to solar system bodies using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy EOS Clathrate hydrates are believed to play a significant role in various solar system environments, e.g. EOS comets, and the surfaces and interiors of icy satellites, however the structural factors governing their formation and dissociation are poorly understood. EOS We demonstrate the use of a high pressure gas cell, combined with variable temperature cooling and time-resolved data collection, to the in situ study of clathrate hydrates under conditions relevant to solar system environments. EOS Clathrates formed and processed within the cell are monitored in situ using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. EOS X-ray diffraction allows the formation of clathrate hydrates to be observed as CO2 gas is applied to ice formed within the cell.	Complete conversion is obtained by annealing at temperatures just below the ice melting point.

We use the ascribed coloring to reduce code memory requirements and optimize accessing the elemental data in memory.
doc	A SCUBA survey of L1689 - The dog that didn't bark EOS We present submillimetre data for the L1689 cloud in the rho-Ophiuchi molecular cloud complex. EOS We detect a number of starless and prestellar cores and protostellar envelopes. EOS We also detect a number of filaments for the first time in the submillimetre continuum that are parallel both to each other, and to filaments observed in the neighbouring L1688 cloud. EOS These filaments are also seen in the 13CO observations of L1689. EOS The filaments contain all of the star-formation activity in the cloud. EOS L1689 lies next to the well studied L1688 cloud that contains the rho Oph-A core. EOS L1688 has a much more active star-formation history than L1689 despite their apparent similarity in 13CO data. EOS Hence we label L1689 as the dog that didn't bark. EOS We endeavour to explain this apparent anomaly by comparing the total mass of each cloud that is currently in the form of dense material such as prestellar cores.	We note firstly that L1688 is more massive than L1689, but we also find that when normalised to the total mass of each cloud, the L1689 cloud has a much lower percentage of mass in dense cores than L1688.
doc	"Contextual weak values" of quantum measurements with positive measurement operators are not limited to the traditional weak value EOS A recent Letter in Physical Review Letters, "Contextual Values of Observables in Quantum Measurements", by J. EOS Dressel, S. EOS Agarwal, and A. EOS N. EOS Jordan (abbreviated DAJ below), introduces the concept of "contextual values" and claims that they lead to "a natural definition of a general conditioned average that converges uniquely to the quantum weak value in the minimal disturbance limit". EOS However, they do not define "minimal disturbance limit".	The present paper is in part the saga of my search for a definition of "minimal disturbance limit" under which this claim could be proved.

doc	The Series Product for Gaussian Quantum Input Processes EOS We present the theory for connecting quantum Markov components into a network with quantum input processes in a Gaussian state (including thermal and squeezed), not necessarily vacuum fields.One would expect on physical grounds that the connection rules should be independent of the state of the input to the network. EOS To compute statistical properties, we use a version of Wicks' Theorem involving fictitious vacuum fields (Fock space based representation of the fields) and while this aids computation, and gives a rigorous formulation, the various representations need not be unitarily equivalent.	In particular, a naive application of the connection rules would lead to the wrong answer.
doc	Responses of the chiral-magnetic-effect-sensitive sine observable to resonance backgrounds in heavy-ion collisions EOS A new sine observable, _EQN_, has been proposed to measure the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions; EOS _EQN_, where _EQN_ are azimuthal angles of positively and negatively charged particles relative to the reaction plane and averages are event-wise, and _EQN_ is a normalized event probability distribution. EOS Preliminary STAR data reveal concave _EQN_ distributions in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions. EOS Studies with a multiphase transport (AMPT) and anomalous-viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) models show concave _EQN_ distributions for CME signals and convex ones for typical resonance backgrounds. EOS A recent hydrodynamic study, however, indicates concave shapes for backgrounds as well. EOS To better understand these results, we report a systematic study of the elliptic flow (_EQN_) and transverse momentum (_EQN_) dependences of resonance backgrounds with toy-model simulations and central limit theorem (CLT) calculations. EOS It is found that the concavity or convexity of _EQN_ depends sensitively on the resonance _EQN_ (which yields different numbers of decay _EQN_ pairs in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions) and _EQN_ (which affects the opening angle of the decay _EQN_ pair). EOS Qualitatively, low _EQN_ resonances decay into large opening-angle pairs and result in more `back-to-back' pairs out-of-plane, mimicking a CME signal, or a concave _EQN_.	Supplemental studies of _EQN_ in terms of the triangular flow (_EQN_), where only backgrounds exist but any CME would average to zero, are also presented.
doc	Anapedesis: Implications and Applications of Bio-Structural Robustness EOS Here we develop an approach to bio-structural robustness integrated with structure-function relationship in a unified conceptual and methodological framework, and envision its study using adequate computational and experimental methods. EOS To distinguish this structural robustness from the abstract organizational robustness of systems, we call it anapedesis, and define it as the scale-independent property of biological objects, from biomolecules to organisms, to deform and recover while minimizing and/or repairing the damage produced by stretch.	We propose to study the consequences of deformation of biological objects closer to their structural and/or functional failure than previously considered relevant.
doc	An invariant of link cobordisms from symplectic Khovanov homology EOS Symplectic Khovanov homology is an invariant of oriented links defined by Seidel and Smith and conjectured to be isomorphic to Khovanov homology. EOS I define morphisms (up to a global sign ambiguity) between symplectic Khovanov homology groups, corresponding to isotopy classes of smooth link cobordisms in 4D between a fixed pair of links. EOS These morphisms define a functor from the category of links and such cobordisms to the category of abelian groups and group homomorphisms up to a sign ambiguity. EOS This provides an extra structure for symplectic Khovanov homology and more generally an isotopy invariant of smooth surfaces in 4D; EOS a first step in proving the conjectured isomorphism of symplectic Khovanov homology and Khovanov homology.	The maps themselves are defined using a generalisation of Seidel's relative invariant of exact Lefschetz fibrations to exact Morse-Bott-Lefschetz fibrations with non-compact singular loci.
doc	Multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces and non-axial octupole correlations in actinide and transfermium nuclei from relativistic mean field models EOS We have developed multi-dimensional constrained covariant density functional theories (MDC-CDFT) for finite nuclei in which the shape degrees of freedom \beta_ \lambda\mu with even \mu, e.g., \beta_ 20, \beta_ 22, \beta_ 30, \beta_ 32, \beta_ 40, etc., can be described simultaneously. EOS The functional can be one of the following four forms: the meson exchange or point-coupling nucleon interactions combined with the non-linear or density-dependent couplings. EOS For the pp channel, either the BCS approach or the Bogoliubov transformation is implemented. EOS The MDC-CDFTs with the BCS approach for the pairing (in the following labelled as MDC-RMF models with RMF standing for "relativistic mean field") have been applied to investigate multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces and the non-axial octupole _EQN_ -correlations in N=150 isotones. EOS In this contribution we present briefly the formalism of MDC-RMF models and some results from these models. EOS The potential energy surfaces with and without triaxial deformations are compared and it is found that the triaxiality plays an important role upon the second fission barriers of actinide nuclei. EOS In the study of Y_ 32 -correlations in N=150 isotones, it is found that, for 248Cf and 250Fm, \beta_ 32 > 0.03 and the energy is lowered by the \beta_ 32 distortion by more than 300 keV;	while for 246Cm and 252No, the pocket with respect to \beta_ 32 is quite shallow.
doc	Dynamics of polar polarizable rotors acted upon by unipolar electromagnetic pulses: From the sudden to the adiabatic regime EOS We study, analytically as well as numerically, the dynamics that arises from the interaction of a polar polarizable rigid rotor with single unipolar electromagnetic pulses of varying length, _EQN_, with respect to the rotational period of the rotor, _EQN_. EOS In the sudden, non-adiabatic limit, _EQN_, we derive analytic expressions for the rotor's wavefunctions, kinetic energies, and field-free evolution of orientation and alignment. EOS We verify the analytic results by solving the corresponding time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation numerically and extend the temporal range of the interactions considered all the way to the adiabatic limit, _EQN_, where general analytic solutions beyond the field-free case are no longer available. EOS The effects of the orienting and aligning interactions as well as of their combination on the post-pulse populations of the rotational states are visualized as functions of the orienting and aligning kick strengths in terms of populations quilts. EOS Quantum carpets that encapsulate the evolution of the rotational wavepackets provide the space-time portraits of the resulting dynamics.	The population quilts and quantum carpets reveal that purely orienting, purely aligning, or even-break combined interactions each exhibit a sui generis dynamics.

doc	Testing the starburst/AGN connection with SWIRE X-ray/70 micron sources EOS We explore the nature of X-ray sources with 70 micron counterparts selected in the SWIRE fields ELAIS-N1, Lockman Hole and Chandra Deep Field South, for which Chandra X-ray data are available. EOS A total of 28 X-ray/70 micron sources in the redshift interval 0.5<z<1.3 are selected. EOS The X-ray luminosities and the shape of the X-ray spectra show that these sources are AGN. EOS Modelling of the optical to far-infrared Spectral Energy Distribution indicates that most of them (27/28) have a strong starburst component (>50 solar masses per year) that dominates in the infrared. EOS It is found that the X-ray and infrared luminosities of the sample sources are broadly correlated, consistent with a link between AGN activity and star-formation.	Contrary to the predictions of some models for the co-evolution of AGN and galaxies, the X-ray/70 micron sources in the sample are not more obscured at X-ray wavelengths compared to the overall X-ray population.

doc	Te/Ti effects on JET energy confinement properties EOS Lately the question has been raised if a modification of the energy-confinement scaling law with respect to the electron to ion temperature ratio, Te/Ti, is required. EOS Theoretically, like in e.g. EOS the Weiland model, the confinement is thought to degrade with Te/Ti and studies of the hot-ion (Ti>/Te) mode seems to corroborate this. EOS In this paper, it is shown that due to a number of effects that cancel each other out, the energy confinement time remains constant for Te/Ti>~1. EOS The numerical study relies on a series of JET shots specifically designed to reveal an effect of Te/Ti in the hot-electron (Te>Ti) mode. EOS A distinct effort was made to keep all current scaling-law parameters constant, including the total heating power.	The effects that provide the constant confinement times have therefore nothing to do with the global properties of the plasma, but are rather due to variations in the temperature gradients which affects the transport locally.
doc	Aharonov-Bohm scattering on a cone EOS The Aharonov-Bohm scattering amplitude is calculated in the context of planar gravity with localized sources which also carry a magnetic flux. EOS These sources cause space-time to develop conical singularities at their location, thus introducing novel effects in the scattering of electrically charged particles. EOS The behaviour of the wave function in the proximity of the classical scattering directions is analyzed by means of an asymptotic expansion previously introduced by the author.	It is found that, in contrast with the Aharonov-Bohm effect in flat space, integer values of the numerical flux can produce observable effects.
doc	The scalar curvature and the biorthogonal curvature: A pinching problem EOS The famous pinching problem says that on a compact simply connected _EQN_ -manifold if its sectional curvature satisfies _EQN_, then the manifold is homeomorphic to the sphere. EOS In [8, problem 12], S. EOS T.	Yau proposed the following problem: If we replace _EQN_ by the scalar curvature, can we deduce similar pinching theorems?
doc	Carrier transport in layered nanolaminated films EOS Analyzing ab-initio electronic and phonon band structure, temperature-dependent carrier transport in layered Ti _EQN_ AlC is investigated. EOS It is found that cylindrical Fermi surface is the origin of the anisotropic carrier effective mass (infinite effective mass along _EQN_ axis) leading to strong anisotropic (insulator along _EQN_ axis and metallic along the layer) carrier transport in these films.	Using electronic and phonon bandstructures, we develop an analytical model of electron-phonon interaction as well as in-plane carrier conductivity originating from strong inter-valley (s _EQN_ d) scattering in Ti _EQN_ AlC.
doc	FADL:Federated-Autonomous Deep Learning for Distributed Electronic Health Record EOS Electronic health record (EHR) data is collected by individual institutions and often stored across locations in silos. EOS Getting access to these data is difficult and slow due to security, privacy, regulatory, and operational issues. EOS We show, using ICU data from 58 different hospitals, that machine learning models to predict patient mortality can be trained efficiently without moving health data out of their silos using a distributed machine learning strategy.	We propose a new method, called Federated-Autonomous Deep Learning (FADL) that trains part of the model using all data sources in a distributed manner and other parts using data from specific data sources.
doc	Properties of Galaxies around AGNs with Most Massive Supermassive Black Hole Revealed by the Clustering Analysis EOS We present results of the clustering analysis between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and galaxies at redshift 0.1-1.0 for investigating properties of galaxies associated with the AGNs, revealing the nature of fueling mechanism of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). EOS We used 8059 SDSS AGNs/QSOs for which virial masses of individual SMBHs were measured, and divided them into four mass groups. EOS Cross-correlation analysis was performed and bias for each mass group was derived. EOS The averaged color and luminosity distributions of galaxies around the AGNs/QSOs were also derived for each mass group. EOS The galaxy color was estimated for SED constructed from a merged SDSS and UKIDSS catalog.	The distributions of color and luminosity were derived by the subtraction method, which does not require redshift information of galaxies.
doc	Machine Learning on Human Connectome Data from MRI EOS Functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) are non-invasive imaging modalities that allow in-vivo analysis of a patient's brain network (known as a connectome). EOS Use of these technologies has enabled faster and better diagnoses and treatments of neurological disorders and a deeper understanding of the human brain.	Recently, researchers have been exploring the application of machine learning models to connectome data in order to predict clinical outcomes and analyze the importance of subnetworks in the brain.
doc	Computational Design of Lightweight Trusses EOS Trusses are load-carrying light-weight structures consisting of bars connected at joints ubiquitously applied in a variety of engineering scenarios. EOS Designing optimal trusses that satisfy functional specifications with a minimal amount of material has interested both theoreticians and practitioners for more than a century. EOS In this paper, we introduce two main ideas to improve upon the state of the art. EOS First, we formulate an alternating linear programming problem for geometry optimization.	Second, we introduce two sets of complementary topological operations, including a novel subdivision scheme for global topology refinement inspired by Michell's famed theoretical study.
doc	Integrable hierarchy, _EQN_ constrained systems, and parametric and peaked stationary solutions EOS This paper gives a new integrable hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations. EOS The DP equation: _EQN_, proposed recently by Desgaperis and Procesi REF, is the first one in the negative hierarchy while the first one in the positive hierarchy is:\ _EQN_. EOS The whole hierarchy is shown Lax-integrable through solving a key matrix equation. EOS To obtain the parametric solutions for the whole hierarchy, we separatedly discuss the negative and the positive hierarchies. EOS For the negative hierarchy, its _EQN_ Lax pairs and corresponding adjoint representations are nonlinearized to be Liouville-integrable Hamiltonian canonical systems under the so-called Dirac-Poisson bracket defined on a symplectic submanifold of _EQN_. EOS Based on the integrability of those finite-dimensional canonical Hamiltonian systems we give the parametric solutions of the all equations in the negative hierarchy. EOS In particular, we obtain the parametric solution of the DP equation. EOS Moreover, for the positive hierarchy, we consider the different constraint and use a similar procudure to the negative case to obtain the parametric solutions of the positive hierarchy. EOS In particular, we give the parametric solution of the 5th-order PDE _EQN_. EOS Finally, we discuss the stationary solutions of the 5th-order PDE, and particularly give its four peaked stationary solutions. EOS The stationary solutions may be included in the parametric solution, but the peaked stationary solutions not.	The 5th-order PDE does not have the cusp soliton although it looks like a higher order Harry-Dym equation.

doc	Berry's phase in the Josephson phase qubit EOS Berry's phase often appears in quantum two-level systems with a degeneracy. EOS An example of such a system is a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field. EOS As the magnetic field is slowly evolved through a closed path, the particle has been shown to acquire an additional phase called Berry's phase, in addition to the usual dynamical phase. EOS This phase has been found in two-level quantum systems intrinsic to many superconducting qubits and has particularly been calculated for the charge, flux and Josephson phase qubit.	Here, we present an alternative derivation of the Berry's phase in a current-biased Josephson junction qubit.

With the full compatibility to the CMOS fabrication process, the proposed pixel design can benefit a variety of applications, including phase microscopy, lensless imaging and machine vision.

Agreement between the data and the Cold + Hot Dark Matter model, however, suggests that a significant fraction of the matter in the universe may consist of massive neutrinos.
doc	Model Order Reduction in Neuroscience EOS The human brain contains approximately _EQN_ neurons, each with approximately _EQN_ connections, synapses, with other neurons. EOS Most sensory, cognitive and motor functions of our brains depend on the interaction of a large population of neurons. EOS In recent years, many technologies are developed for recording large numbers of neurons either sequentially or simultaneously. EOS An increase in computational power and algorithmic developments have enabled advanced analyses of neuronal population parallel to the rapid growth of quantity and complexity of the recorded neuronal activity. EOS Recent studies made use of dimensionality and model order reduction techniques to extract coherent features which are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. EOS It has been observed that the neuronal activity evolves on low-dimensional subspaces. EOS The aim of model reduction of large-scale neuronal networks is an accurate and fast prediction of patterns and their propagation in different areas of the brain. EOS Spatiotemporal features of the brain activity are identified on low dimensional subspaces with methods such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) and combined parameter and state reduction. EOS In this paper, we give an overview of the currently used dimensionality reduction and model order reduction techniques in neuroscience.

doc	On the impact of the global energy policy framework on the development and sustainability of renewable power systems in Sub-Saharan Africa: the case of solar PV EOS From 1972 and the Meadows report to 1997 and the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by most of the countries in the world, the global energy policy framework has undergone a paradigm shift, as human societies have been leaving aside the sole economic growth to embrace the broader concept of sustainable development.	As new electrification vectors, modern renewable power systems, such as solar PV, have sprung up in the wake of this major mutation and have typically been following an exponential growth since the mid-nineties.

doc	Autoencoder Based Sample Selection for Self-Taught Learning EOS Self-taught learning is a technique that uses a large number of unlabeled data as source samples to improve the task performance on target samples. EOS Compared with other transfer learning techniques, self-taught learning can be applied to a broader set of scenarios due to the loose restrictions on the source data.	However, knowledge transferred from source samples that are not sufficiently related to the target domain may negatively influence the target learner, which is referred to as negative transfer.
doc	Joint Analysis of Gravitational Lensing, Clustering and Abundance: Toward the Unification of Large-Scale Structure Analysis EOS We explore three different methods based on weak lensing to extract cosmological constraints from the large-scale structure. EOS In the first approach (method I), small-scale galaxy lensing measurements of their halo mass provide a constraint on the halo bias, which can be combined with the large-scale galaxy clustering to measure the dark matter clustering. EOS In the second approach (method II), large-scale galaxy clustering and large-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing can be combined into a direct measurement of the dark matter clustering. EOS These two methods can be combined into one method I+II to make use of lensing measurements on all scales. EOS In the third approach (method III), we add abundance information to the method I.	We explore the statistical power of these three approaches as a function of galaxy luminosity to investigate the optimal mass range for each method and their cosmological constraining power.

doc	Large-time behavior of the _EQN_ -gradient flow of length for closed plane curves EOS We consider the _EQN_ -gradient flow of length for closed plane curves. EOS This flow is a generalization of curve diffusion flow. EOS We investigate the large-time behavior assuming the global existence of the flow. EOS Then we show that the evolving curve converges exponentially to a circle.	To do this, we use interpolation inequalities between the deviation of curvature and the isoperimetric ratio, recently established by Nagasawa and the author.
doc	Categorizing Influential Authors Using Penalty Areas EOS The concept of h-index has been proposed to easily assess a researcher's performance with a single two-dimensional number. EOS However, by using only this single number, we lose significant information about the distribution of the number of citations per article of an author's publication list. EOS Two authors with the same h-index may have totally different distributions of the number of citations per article. EOS One may have a very long "tail" in the citation curve, i.e. EOS he may have published a great number of articles, which did not receive relatively many citations. EOS Another researcher may have a short tail, i.e. EOS almost all his publications got a relatively large number of citations. EOS In this article, we study an author's citation curve and we define some areas appearing in this curve.	These areas are used to further evaluate authors' research performance from quantitative and qualitative point of view.

doc	Canted Antiferromagnetic Order of Imbalanced Fermi-Fermi mixtures in Optical Lattices by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory EOS We investigate antiferromagnetic order of repulsively interacting fermionic atoms in an optical lattice by means of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). EOS Special attention is paid to the case of an imbalanced mixture. EOS We take into account the presence of an underlying harmonic trap, both in a local density approximation and by performing full Real-Space DMFT calculations. EOS We consider the case that the particle density in the trap center is at half filling, leading to an antiferromagnetic region in the center, surrounded by a Fermi liquid region at the edge. EOS In the case of an imbalanced mixture, the antiferromagnetism is directed perpendicular to the ferromagnetic polarization and canted. EOS We pay special attention to the boundary structure between the antiferromagnetic and the Fermi liquid phase.	For the moderately strong interactions considered here, no Stoner instability toward a ferromagnetic phase is found.
doc	Heavy inertial particles in turbulent flows gain energy slowly but lose it rapidly EOS We present an extensive numerical study of the time irreversibility of the dynamics of heavy inertial particles in three-dimensional, statistically homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows. EOS We show that the probability density function (PDF) of the increment, _EQN_, of a particle's energy over a time-scale _EQN_ is non-Gaussian, and skewed towards negative values. EOS This implies that, on average, particles gain energy over a period of time that is longer than the duration over which they lose energy. EOS We call this _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS We find that the third moment of _EQN_ scales as _EQN_, for small values of _EQN_. EOS We show that the PDF of power-input _EQN_ is negatively skewed too;	we use this skewness _EQN_ as a measure of the time-irreversibility and we demonstrate that it increases sharply with the Stokes number _EQN_, for small _EQN_ ;
doc	Quasipolynomial Normalisation in Deep Inference via Atomic Flows and Threshold Formulae EOS Je\v r \'abek showed that cuts in classical propositional logic proofs in deep inference can be eliminated in quasipolynomial time. EOS The proof is indirect and it relies on a result of Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak about monotone sequent calculus and a correspondence between that system and cut-free deep-inference proofs. EOS In this paper we give a direct proof of Je\v r \'abek's result: we give a quasipolynomial-time cut-elimination procedure for classical propositional logic in deep inference.	The main new ingredient is the use of a computational trace of deep-inference proofs called atomic flows, which are both very simple (they only trace structural rules and forget logical rules) and strong enough to faithfully represent the cut-elimination procedure.
doc	Phenomenology of Irreversible Processes from Gravity EOS We propose that the space-time evolution of strongly coupled matter formed by ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions can be modelled by phenomenological equations involving the energy-momentum tensor and conserved currents alone. EOS These equations can describe the late stage of local chemical and thermal equilibration of the matter formed after collisions, and its subsequent transition to hydrodynamic expansion in an unified framework. EOS The full set of equations include local energy, momentum and charge conservation; EOS but also additional equations for evolution of non-equilibrium variables.	These equations with precisely determined phenomenological parameters can be obtained by the AdS/CFT correspondence.

doc	Interacting Large-Scale Magnetic Fields and Ionised Gas in the W50/SS433 System EOS The W50/SS433 system is an unusual Galactic outflow-driven object of debatable origin. EOS We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to observe a new 198 pointing mosaic, covering _EQN_, and present the highest-sensitivity full-Stokes data of W50 to date using wide-field, wide-band imaging over a 2 GHz bandwidth centred at 2.1 GHz. EOS We also present a complementary H _EQN_ mosaic created using the Isaac Newton Telescope Photometric H _EQN_ Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS). EOS The magnetic structure of W50 is found to be consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that the nebula is a reanimated shell-like supernova remnant (SNR), that has been re-energised by the jets from SS433. EOS We observe strong depolarization effects that correlate with diffuse H _EQN_ emission, likely due to spatially-varying Faraday rotation measure (RM) fluctuations of _EQN_ to 61 rad m _EQN_ on scales _EQN_ to 6 pc.	We also report the discovery of numerous, faint, H _EQN_ filaments that are unambiguously associated with the central region of W50.
doc	Localized excitations and interactional solutions for the reduced Maxwell-Bloch equations EOS Based on nonlocal symmetry method, localized excitations and interactional solutions are investigated for the reduced Maxwell-Bloch equations.

doc	Generation of controllable plasma wakefield noise in particle-in-cell simulations EOS Numerical simulations of beam-plasma instabilities may produce quantitatively incorrect results because of unrealistically high initial noise from which the instabilities develop. EOS Of particular importance is the wakefield noise, the potential perturbations that have a phase velocity which is equal to the beam velocity. EOS Controlling the noise level in simulations may offer the possibility of extrapolating simulation results to the more realistic low-noise case.	We propose a novel method for generating wakefield noise with a controllable amplitude by randomly located charged rods propagating ahead of the beam.
doc	Non-Abelian bosonization and modular transformation approach to superuniversality EOS Quantum Hall inter-plateaux transitions are physical exemplars of quantum phase transitions. EOS Near each of these transitions, the measured electrical conductivity scales with the same correlation length and dynamical critical exponents, i.e., the critical points are superuniversal. EOS In apparent contradiction to these experiments, prior theoretical studies of quantum Hall phase transitions within the framework of Abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to matter found correlation length exponents that depend on the value of the quantum critical Hall conductivity. EOS Here, we use non-Abelian bosonization and modular transformations to theoretically study the phenomenon of superuniversality. EOS Specifically, we introduce a new effective theory that has an emergent _EQN_ gauge symmetry with any _EQN_ for a quantum phase transition between an integer quantum Hall state and an insulator.	We then use modular transformations to generate from this theory effective descriptions for transitions between a large class of fractional quantum Hall states whose quasiparticle excitations have Abelian statistics.

EOS We analyzed the COMPTEL data (0.75 - 30 MeV) of this time period to investigate the behaviour of PKS 1622-297 at lower gamma-ray energies.	The blazar is significantly (5.7 sigma) detected by COMPTEL at energies above 10 MeV.
doc	Protein Contact Prediction by Integrating Joint Evolutionary Coupling Analysis and Supervised Learning EOS Protein contacts contain important information for protein structure and functional study, but contact prediction from sequence remains very challenging. EOS Both evolutionary coupling (EC) analysis and supervised machine learning methods are developed to predict contacts, making use of different types of information, respectively. EOS This paper presents a group graphical lasso (GGL) method for contact prediction that integrates joint multi-family EC analysis and supervised learning. EOS Different from existing single-family EC analysis that uses residue co-evolution information in only the target protein family, our joint EC analysis uses residue co-evolution in both the target family and its related families, which may have divergent sequences but similar folds. EOS To implement joint EC analysis, we model a set of related protein families using Gaussian graphical models (GGM) and then co-estimate their precision matrices by maximum-likelihood, subject to the constraint that the precision matrices shall share similar residue co-evolution patterns. EOS To further improve the accuracy of the estimated precision matrices, we employ a supervised learning method to predict contact probability from a variety of evolutionary and non-evolutionary information and then incorporate the predicted probability as prior into our GGL framework.	Experiments show that our method can predict contacts much more accurately than existing methods, and that our method performs better on both conserved and family-specific contacts.
doc	Constant Step Size Stochastic Gradient Descent for Probabilistic Modeling EOS Stochastic gradient methods enable learning probabilistic models from large amounts of data. EOS While large step-sizes (learning rates) have shown to be best for least-squares (e.g., Gaussian noise) once combined with parameter averaging, these are not leading to convergent algorithms in general. EOS In this paper, we consider generalized linear models, that is, conditional models based on exponential families.	We propose averaging moment parameters instead of natural parameters for constant-step-size stochastic gradient descent.

doc	On the Nature of Black Holes in Loop Quantum Gravity EOS A genuine notion of black holes can only be obtained in the fundamental framework of quantum gravity resolving the curvature singularities and giving an account of the statistical mechanical, microscopic degrees of freedom able to explain the black hole thermodynamical properties. EOS As for all quantum systems, a quantum realization of black holes requires an operator algebra of the fundamental observables of the theory which is introduced in this study based on aspects of loop quantum gravity. EOS From the eigenvalue spectra of the quantum operators for the black hole area, charge and angular momentum, it is demonstrated that a strict bound on the extensive parameters, different from the relation arising in classical general relativity, holds, implying that the extremal black hole state can neither be measured nor can its existence be proven. EOS This is, as turns out, a result of the specific form of the chosen angular momentum operator and the corresponding eigenvalue spectrum, or rather the quantum measurement process of angular momentum.	Quantum mechanical considerations and the lowest, non-zero eigenvalue of the loop quantum gravity black hole mass spectrum indicate, on the one hand, a physical Planck scale cutoff of the Hawking temperature law and, on the other hand, give upper and lower bounds on the numerical value of the Immirzi parameter.

doc	How degenerate is the parametrization of neural networks with the ReLU activation function? EOS Neural network training is usually accomplished by solving a non-convex optimization problem using stochastic gradient descent. EOS Although one optimizes over the networks parameters, the main loss function generally only depends on the realization of the neural network, i.e. EOS the function it computes. EOS Studying the optimization problem over the space of realizations opens up new ways to understand neural network training. EOS In particular, usual loss functions like mean squared error and categorical cross entropy are convex on spaces of neural network realizations, which themselves are non-convex. EOS Approximation capabilities of neural networks can be used to deal with the latter non-convexity, which allows us to establish that for sufficiently large networks local minima of a regularized optimization problem on the realization space are almost optimal. EOS Note, however, that each realization has many different, possibly degenerate, parametrizations. EOS In particular, a local minimum in the parametrization space needs not correspond to a local minimum in the realization space. EOS To establish such a connection, inverse stability of the realization map is required, meaning that proximity of realizations must imply proximity of corresponding parametrizations.	We present pathologies which prevent inverse stability in general, and, for shallow networks, proceed to establish a restricted space of parametrizations on which we have inverse stability w.r.t.
doc	Universal Effective Hadron Dynamics from Superconformal Algebra EOS An effective supersymmetric QCD light-front Hamiltonian for hadrons composed of light quarks, which includes a spin-spin interaction between the hadronic constituents, is constructed by embedding superconformal quantum mechanics into AdS space. EOS A specific breaking of conformal symmetry inside the graded algebra determines a unique effective quark-confining potential for light hadrons, as well as remarkable connections between the meson and baryon spectra. EOS The results are consistent with the empirical features of the light-quark hadron spectra, including a universal mass scale for the slopes of the meson and baryon Regge trajectories and a zero-mass pion in the limit of massless quarks. EOS Our analysis is consistently applied to the excitation spectra of the _EQN_ and _EQN_ meson families as well as to the _EQN_ and _EQN_ in the baryon sector. EOS We also predict the existence of tetraquarks which are degenerate in mass with baryons with the same angular momentum.	The mass of light hadrons is expressed in a universal and frame-independent decomposition in the semiclassical approximation described here.
doc	SDSS J080449.49+161624.8: A peculiar AM CVn star from a colour-selected sample of candidates EOS We describe a spectroscopic survey designed to uncover an estimated ~40 AM CVn stars hiding in the photometric database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). EOS We have constructed a relatively small sample of about 1500 candidates based on a colour selection, which should contain the majority of all AM CVn binaries while remaining small enough that spectroscopic identification of the full sample is feasible. EOS We present the first new AM CVn star discovered using this strategy, SDSS J080449.49+161624.8, the ultracompact binary nature of which is demonstrated using high-time-resolution spectroscopy obtained at the Magellan telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. EOS A kinematic 'S-wave' feature is observed on a period 44.5+/-0.1min, which we propose is the orbital period, although the present data cannot yet exclude its nearest daily aliases. EOS The new AM CVn star shows a peculiar spectrum of broad, single-peaked helium emission lines with unusually strong series of ionised helium, reminiscent of the (intermediate) polars among the hydrogen-rich Cataclysmic Variables.

EOS We employ a framework based on Volkov states with a time dependent laser envelope in light-cone coordinates within the Furry picture. EOS An expression for the cross section is constructed, which is independent of the considered pulse shape and pulse length. EOS A broad distribution of scatted photons with a rich pattern of subpeaks like that obtained in Thomson scattering is found.	These broad peaks may overlap at sufficiently high laser intensity, rendering inappropriate the notion of individual harmonics.

doc	The rare _EQN_ decays in Standard Model and as a probe of R-parity violation EOS We present the first study of the rare annihilation decay _EQN_ in the Standard Model.

As an example, we calculate the effects of R-parity violating couplings.

doc	Protecting User Privacy: An Approach for Untraceable Web Browsing History and Unambiguous User Profiles EOS The overturning of the Internet Privacy Rules by the Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) in late March 2017 allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to collect, share and sell their customers' Web browsing data without their consent. EOS With third-party trackers embedded on Web pages, this new rule has put user privacy under more risk. EOS The need arises for users on their own to protect their Web browsing history from any potential adversaries. EOS Although some available solutions such as Tor, VPN, and HTTPS can help users conceal their online activities, their use can also significantly hamper personalized online services, i.e., degraded utility. EOS In this paper, we design an effective Web browsing history anonymization scheme, PBooster, aiming to protect users' privacy while retaining the utility of their Web browsing history.	The proposed model pollutes users' Web browsing history by automatically inferring how many and what links should be added to the history while addressing the utility-privacy trade-off challenge.
doc	End-to-End Denoising of Dark Burst Images Using Recurrent Fully Convolutional Networks EOS When taking photos in dim-light environments, due to the small amount of light entering, the shot images are usually extremely dark, with a great deal of noise, and the color cannot reflect real-world color.	Under this condition, the traditional methods used for single image denoising have always failed to be effective.

doc	New observations of DW Cnc: where is the 38 min signal? EOS We present extensive radial-velocity observations of the intermediate polar DW Cnc during its 2018-2019 low state. EOS We show that the 86 min signal, associated with the orbital period is strong in our radial velocity analysis, power spectrum search, as well as in our Doppler Tomography. EOS However, we find that the velocity modulation associated with the 70-min beat period and the 38-min spin cycle are dramatically weaker than previously observed. EOS We put forward two interpretations for this change. EOS The first is that a sudden drop into a low state detected in 2018-2019 caused an episode of low mass transfer from the companion, thus inhibiting the light-house effect produced by the rebound emission. EOS The second is that this is a consequence of a rare outburst detected in 2007 by Crawford (2008). EOS We find this post-outburst hypothesis to be less likely. EOS If the first scenario is correct, we predict that DW Cnc will recover its intermediate polar characteristics. EOS A new ephemeris is presented by combining Patterson et aal.	(2004) radial velocities with ours.
doc	Deep X-Ray Observations of Supernova Remnants G359.1-0.5 and G359.0-0.9 with ASCA EOS We present the results of deep ASCA observations of two shell-like radio supernova remnants (SNRs) located in the direction to the Galactic center (GC) region. EOS Unlike the radio morphology, G359.1-0.5 shows center-filled X-rays with prominent K-alpha lines of He-like silicon and H-like sulfur. EOS The plasma requires at least two temperature components: a silicon-dominated cool plasma of 0.6keV temperature and a sulfur-dominated higher temperature plasma of 4.4keV. EOS Because the absorption column is ~ 6x10^22 H cm^-2, this SNR would be near to the GC. EOS The spherical plasma is attributable to supernova ejecta with the total mass of Si and S being about 0.1 solar mass and 0.3 solar mass, respectively.	X-rays from G359.0-0.9 trace the partial shell structure of the radio emission.

Our results demonstrate that magnetic field universally hastens thermalization of strongly coupled gauge theory plasma.

EOS FERMI has detected high-energy gamma rays from the Moon produced by interactions of cosmic rays with the lunar surface. EOS This radiation was previously observed by EGRET on CGRO with significantly lower statistical significance. EOS We present the lunar analysis for the first six months of the Mission and showing images of the lunar gamma-ray emission.	We also compare the flux measurements with models the earlier EGRET measurements.
doc	Development of an Accelerated Test Methodology to the Predict Service Life of Polymeric Materials Subject to Outdoor Weathering EOS Service life prediction is of great importance to manufacturers of coatings and other polymeric materials. EOS Photodegradation, driven primarily by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, is the primary cause of failure for organic paints and coatings, as well as many other products made from polymeric materials exposed to sunlight.	Traditional methods of service life prediction involve the use of outdoor exposure in harsh UV environments (e.g., Florida and Arizona).

doc	Conceptor Debiasing of Word Representations Evaluated on WEAT EOS Bias in word embeddings such as Word2Vec has been widely investigated, and many efforts made to remove such bias. EOS We show how to use conceptors debiasing to post-process both traditional and contextualized word embeddings.	Our conceptor debiasing can simultaneously remove racial and gender biases and, unlike standard debiasing methods, can make effect use of heterogeneous lists of biased words.
doc	How do elements really factor in _EQN_? EOS Most undergraduate level abstract algebra texts use _EQN_ as an example of an integral domain which is not a unique factorization domain (or UFD) by exhibiting two distinct irreducible factorizations of a nonzero element. EOS But such a brief example, which requires merely an understanding of basic norms, only scratches the surface of how elements actually factor in this ring of algebraic integers. EOS We offer here an interactive framework which shows that while _EQN_ is not a UFD, it does satisfy a slightly weaker factorization condition, known as half-factoriality.	The arguments involved revolve around the Fundamental Theorem of Ideal Theory in algebraic number fields.
doc	Ultrafast Optical Excitation of a Persistent Surface-State Population in the Topological Insulator Bi2Se3 EOS Using femtosecond time- and angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we investigated the nonequilibrium dynamics of the topological insulator Bi2Se3. EOS We studied p-type Bi2Se3, in which the metallic Dirac surface state and bulk conduction bands are unoccupied. EOS Optical excitation leads to a meta-stable population at the bulk conduction band edge, which feeds a nonequilibrium population of the surface state persisting for >10ps.	This unusually long-lived population of a metallic Dirac surface state with spin texture may present a channel in which to drive transient spin-polarized currents.
doc	A Cold, Massive, Rotating Disk Galaxy 1.5 Billion Years after the Big Bang EOS Massive disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to form at late times in traditional models of galaxy formation, but recent numerical simulations suggest that such galaxies could form as early as a billion years after the Big Bang through the accretion of cold material and mergers. EOS Observationally, it has been difficult to identify disk galaxies in emission at high redshift, in order to discern between competing models of galaxy formation.	Here we report imaging, with a resolution of about 1.3 kiloparsecs, of the 158-micrometre emission line from singly ionized carbon, the far-infrared dust continuum and the near-ultraviolet continuum emission from a galaxy at a redshift of 4.2603, identified by detecting its absorption of quasar light.

doc	Fifty shades of black EOS The paper proposes a new and systematic approach to the so-called black box group methods in computational group theory. EOS As the starting point of our programme, we construct Frobenius maps on black box groups of untwisted Lie type in odd characteristic and then apply them to black box groups X encrypting groups (P)SL(2,q) in small odd characteristics. EOS We propose an algorithm constructing a black box field K isomorphic to F_q, and an isomorphism from (P)SL(2,K) to X.	The algorithm runs in time quadratic in the characteristic of the underlying field and polynomial in log q.
doc	Peakompactons: Peaked compact nonlinear waves EOS This article is meant as an accessible introduction to/tutorial on the analytical construction and numerical simulation of a class of non-standard solitary waves termed ph peakompactons. EOS These peaked compactly supported waves arise as solutions to nonlinear evolution equations from a hierarchy of nonlinearly dispersive Korteweg--de Vries-type models.	Peakompactons, like the now-well-know compactons and unlike the soliton solutions of the Korteweg--de Vries equation, have finite support, i.e.
doc	Multi-level conformal clustering: A distribution-free technique for clustering and anomaly detection EOS In this work we present a clustering technique called \textit multi-level conformal clustering (MLCC).

doc	Connection between the Accretion Disk and Jet in the Radio Galaxy 3C 111 EOS We present the results of extensive multi-frequency monitoring of the radio galaxy 3C 111 between 2004 and 2010 at X-ray (2.4--10 keV), optical (R band), and radio (14.5, 37, and 230 GHz) wave bands, as well as multi-epoch imaging with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43 GHz. EOS Over the six years of observation, significant dips in the X-ray light curve are followed by ejections of bright superluminal knots in the VLBA images. EOS This shows a clear connection between the radiative state near the black hole, where the X-rays are produced, and events in the jet. EOS The X-ray continuum flux and Fe line intensity are strongly correlated, with a time lag shorter than 90 days and consistent with zero. EOS This implies that the Fe line is generated within 90 light-days of the source of the X-ray continuum. EOS The power spectral density function of X-ray variations contains a break, with steeper slope at shorter timescales. EOS The break timescale of 13 (+12,-6) days is commensurate with scaling according to the mass of the central black hole based on observations of Seyfert galaxies and black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). EOS The data are consistent with the standard paradigm, in which the X-rays are predominantly produced by inverse Compton scattering of thermal optical/UV seed photons from the accretion disk by a distribution of hot electrons --- the corona --- situated near the disk.	Most of the optical emission is generated in the accretion disk due to reprocessing of the X-ray emission.

doc	Collaborative Uploading in Heterogeneous Networks: Optimal and Adaptive Strategies EOS Collaborative uploading describes a type of crowdsourcing scenario in networked environments where a device utilizes multiple paths over neighboring devices to upload content to a centralized processing entity such as a cloud service. EOS Intermediate devices may aggregate and preprocess this data stream. EOS Such scenarios arise in the composition and aggregation of information, e.g., from smartphones or sensors.	We use a queuing theoretic description of the collaborative uploading scenario, capturing the ability to split data into chunks that are then transmitted over multiple paths, and finally merged at the destination.
doc	Contention Intensity based Distributed Coordination for V2V Safety Message Broadcast EOS In this paper, we propose a contention intensity based distributed coordination (CIDC) scheme for safety message broadcast. EOS By exploiting the high-frequency and periodical features of the safety message broadcast, the application-layer design of the CIDC enables each vehicle to estimate the instantaneous channel contention intensity in a fully distributed manner. EOS With the contention intensity information, the MAC layer design of CIDC allows vehicles to adopt a better channel access strategy compared to the 802.11p. EOS This is because CIDC selects the initial back-off counter for each new packet deterministically, i.e., based on the contention intensity, instead of randomly. EOS The proposed CIDC is modeled, and key performance indicators in terms of the packet collision probability and average contention delay, are derived.	It is shown that the proposed change in the initial counter selection leads to a system model completely different from the classic Markov chain based model.

doc	Energy Efficient Hardware for On-Device CNN Inference via Transfer Learning EOS On-device CNN inference for real-time computer vision applications can result in computational demands that far exceed the energy budgets of mobile devices. EOS This paper proposes FixyNN, a co-designed hardware accelerator platform which splits a CNN model into two parts: a set of layers that are fixed in the hardware platform as a front-end fixed-weight feature extractor, and the remaining layers which become a back-end classifier running on a conventional programmable CNN accelerator. EOS The common front-end provides ubiquitous CNN features for all FixyNN models, while the back-end is programmable and specific to a given dataset. EOS Image classification models for FixyNN are trained end-to-end via transfer learning, with front-end layers fixed for the shared feature extractor, and back-end layers fine-tuned for a specific task. EOS Over a suite of six datasets, we trained models via transfer learning with an accuracy loss of <1%, resulting in a FixyNN hardware platform with nearly 2 times better energy efficiency than a conventional programmable CNN accelerator of the same silicon area (i.e.	hardware cost).
doc	Thermal conductivity of dense quark matter and cooling of stars EOS The thermal conductivity of the color-flavor locked phase of dense quark matter is calculated. EOS The dominant contribution to the conductivity comes from photons and Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with breaking of baryon number which are trapped in the quark core. EOS Because of their very large mean free path the conductivity is also very large. EOS The cooling of the quark core arises mostly from the heat flux across the surface of direct contact with the nuclear matter. EOS As the thermal conductivity of the neighboring layer is also high, the whole interior of the star should be nearly isothermal.	Our results imply that the cooling time of compact stars with color-flavor locked quark cores is similar to that of ordinary neutron stars.

doc	Competition in periodic media: II -- Segregative limit of pulsating fronts and "Unity is not Strength"-type result EOS This paper is concerned with the limit, as the interspecific competition rate goes to infinity, of pulsating front solutions in space-periodic media for a bistable two-species competition--diffusion Lotka--Volterra system. EOS We distinguish two important cases: null asymptotic speed and non-null as-ymptotic speed. EOS In the former case, we show the existence of a segregated stationary equilibrium. EOS In the latter case, we are able to uniquely characterize the segregated pulsating front, and thus full convergence is proved. EOS The segregated pulsating front solves an interesting free boundary problem. EOS We also investigate the sign of the speed as a function of the parameters of the competitive system.	We are able to determine it in full generality, with explicit conditions depending on the various parameters of the problem.

doc	Systematic Studies of the Centrality and sqrt(s_NN) Dependence of dE_T/deta and dN_ch/deta in Heavy Ion Collisions at Mid-rapidity EOS The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has measured transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 19.6, 130 and 200 GeV as a function of centrality. EOS The presented results are compared to measurements from other RHIC experiments, and experiments at lower energies. EOS The sqrt(s_NN) dependence of dE_T/deta and dN_ch/deta per pair of participants is consistent with logarithmic scaling for the most central events.	The centrality dependence of dE_T/deta and dN_ch/deta is similar at all measured incident energies.
doc	Quantum Control Landscapes Beyond the Dipole Approximation EOS We investigate the control landscapes of closed, finite level quantum systems beyond the dipole approximation by including a polarizability term in the Hamiltonian. EOS Theoretical analysis is presented for the _EQN_ level case and formulas for singular controls, which are candidates for landscape traps, are compared to their analogues in the dipole approximation. EOS A numerical analysis of the existence of traps in control landscapes beyond the dipole approximation is made in the four level case. EOS A numerical exploration of these control landscapes is achieved by generating many random Hamiltonians which include a term quadratic in a single control field. EOS The landscapes of such systems are found numerically to be trap free in general.	This extends a great body of recent work on typical landscapes of quantum systems where the dipole approximation is made.
doc	Constraining very-high-energy and optical emission from FRB 121102 with the MAGIC telescopes EOS Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright flashes observed typically at GHz frequencies with millisecond duration, whose origin is likely extragalactic. EOS Their nature remains mysterious, motivating searches for counterparts at other wavelengths. EOS FRB 121102 is so far the only source known to repeatedly emit FRBs and is associated with a host galaxy at redshift _EQN_. EOS We conducted simultaneous observations of FRB 121102 with the Arecibo and MAGIC telescopes during several epochs in 2016--2017. EOS This allowed searches for millisecond-timescale burst emission in very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays as well as the optical band. EOS While a total of five FRBs were detected during these observations, no VHE emission was detected, neither of a persistent nature nor burst-like associated with the FRBs.	The average integral flux upper limits above 100 GeV at 95% confidence level are _EQN_ (corresponding to luminosity _EQN_) over the entire observation period, and _EQN_ (_EQN_) over the total duration of the five FRBs.
doc	A dual null formalism for the collapse of fluids in a cosmological background EOS In this work we revisit the definition of Matter Trapping Surfaces (MTS) introduced in previous investigations and show how it can be expressed in the so-called dual null formalism developed for Trapping Horizons (TH).	With the aim of unifying both approaches, we construct a 2+2 threading from the 1+3 flow, and thus isolate one prefered spatial direction, that allows straightforward translation into a dual nul subbasis, and to deduce the geometric apparatus that follows.
doc	Towards a Definition of an Algorithm EOS We define an algorithm to be the set of programs that implement or express that algorithm. EOS The set of all programs is partitioned into equivalence classes. EOS Two programs are equivalent if they are essentially the same program. EOS The set of equivalence classes forms the category of algorithms. EOS Although the set of programs does not even form a category, the set of algorithms form a category with extra structure.	The conditions we give that describe when two programs are essentially the same turn out to be coherence relations that enrich the category of algorithms with extra structure.
doc	The Orion OB1 Association II. The Orion-Eridanus Bubble EOS Observations of the interstellar medium in the vicinity of the Orion OB1 association show a cavity filled with hot ionized gas, surrounded by an expanding shell of neutral hydrogen (the Orion-Eridanus Bubble). EOS In this paper we examine this cavity and the surrounding bubble with the aid of data from the Leiden/Dwingeloo HI survey. EOS We present neutral-hydrogen maps for the Orion-Eridanus region which allow identification of the HI filaments and arcs delineating the Bubble and derivation of its expansion velocity. EOS The HI data are compared to X-ray, CO and IRAS 100 micron data.	Using models of wind blown bubbles that take the density stratification of the Galactic HI layer into account we show that the stellar winds and supernovae from stars in Orion OB1 can account for the size as well as the expansion velocity of the HI shell.
doc	Neutrino Sector with Majorana Mass Terms and Friedberg-Lee Symmetry EOS We examine a recently proposed symmetry/condition by Friedberg and Lee in the framework where three right-handed neutrinos are added to the spectrum of the three-family Minimal Standard Model. EOS It is found that the right-handed neutrinos are very special, with respect to this symmetry. EOS In the symmetry limit the neutrinos are massless and that may be a hint about why they are light.	Imposed as a condition and not as a full symmetry, we find that one of the three right-handed neutrinos simply decouples (has only gravitational interactions) and that there is a massless interacting neutrino.
doc	Transfer Learning by Asymmetric Image Weighting for Segmentation across Scanners EOS Supervised learning has been very successful for automatic segmentation of images from a single scanner. EOS However, several papers report deteriorated performances when using classifiers trained on images from one scanner to segment images from other scanners. EOS We propose a transfer learning classifier that adapts to differences between training and test images. EOS This method uses a weighted ensemble of classifiers trained on individual images. EOS The weight of each classifier is determined by the similarity between its training image and the test image. EOS We examine three unsupervised similarity measures, which can be used in scenarios where no labeled data from a newly introduced scanner or scanning protocol is available.	The measures are based on a divergence, a bag distance, and on estimating the labels with a clustering procedure.
doc	Metal enrichment signatures of the first stars on high-z DLAs EOS We use numerical N-body hydrodynamical simulations with varying PopIII stellar models to investigate the possibility of detecting first star signatures with observations of high-redshift damped Ly _EQN_ absorbers (DLAs). EOS The simulations include atomic and molecular cooling, star formation, energy feedback and metal spreading due to the evolution of stars with a range of masses and metallicities. EOS Different initial mass functions (IMFs) and corresponding metal-dependent yields and lifetimes are adopted to model primordial stellar populations. EOS The DLAs in the simulations are selected according to either the local gas temperature (temperature selected) or the host mass (mass selected). EOS We find that 3\% (40\%) of mass (temperature) selected high- _EQN_ (_EQN_) DLAs retain signatures of pollution from PopIII stars, independently from the first star model. EOS Such DLAs have low halo mass (_EQN_), metallicity (_EQN_) and star formation rate (_EQN_). EOS Metal abundance ratios of DLAs imprinted in the spectra of QSO can be useful tools to infer the properties of the polluting stellar generation and to constrain the first star mass ranges.	Comparing the abundance ratios derived from our simulations to those observed in DLAs at _EQN_, we find that most of these DLAs are consistent within errors with PopII stars dominated enrichment and strongly disfavor the pollution pattern of very massive first stars (i.e.
doc	Parameter Estimation in Astronomy with Poisson-Distributed Data. II. The Modified Chi-Square-Gamma Statistic EOS I investigate the use of Pearson's chi-square statistic, the Maximum Likelihood Ratio statistic for Poisson distributions, and the chi-square-gamma statistic (Mighell 1999, ApJ, 518, 380) for the determination of the goodness-of-fit between theoretical models and low-count Poisson-distributed data. EOS I demonstrate that these statistics should not be used to determine the goodness-of-fit with data values of 10 or less. EOS I modify the chi-square-gamma statistic for the purpose of improving its goodness-of-fit performance.	I demonstrate that the modified chi-square-gamma statistic performs (nearly) like an ideal chi-square statistic for the determination of goodness-of-fit with low-count data.
doc	Defining the Topological Influencers and Predictive Principles to Engineer Band Structure of Halide Perovskites EOS Complex quantum coupling phenomena of halide perovskites are examined through ab-initio calculations and exact diagonalization of model Hamiltonians to formulate a set of fundamental guiding rules to engineer the bandgap through strain. EOS The bandgap tuning in halides is crucial for photovoltaic applications and for establishing non-trivial electronic states. EOS Using CsSnI _EQN_ as the prototype material, we show that in the cubic phase, the bandgap reduces irrespective of the nature of strain. EOS However, for the tetragonal phase, it reduces with tensile strain and increases with compressive strain, while the reverse is the case for the orthorhombic phase. EOS The reduction can give rise to negative bandgap in the cubic and tetragonal phases leading to normal to topological insulator phase transition. EOS Also, these halides tend to form a stability plateau in a space spanned by strain and octahedral rotation. EOS In this plateau, with negligible cost to the total energy, the bandgap can be varied in a range of 1eV. EOS Furthermore, we present a descriptor model for the perovskite to simulate their bandgap with strain and rotation. EOS Analysis of band topology through model Hamiltonians led to the conceptualization of topological influencers that provide a quantitative measure of the contribution of each chemical bonding towards establishing a normal or topological insulator phase.	On the technical aspect, we show that a four orbital based basis set (Sn- _EQN_ for CsSnI _EQN_) is sufficient to construct the model Hamiltonian which can explain the electronic structure of each polymorph of halide perovskites.

doc	Cotangent Bundles with General Natural Kahler Structures EOS We study the conditions under which an almost Hermitian structure _EQN_ of general natural lift type on the cotangent bundle _EQN_ of a Riemannian manifold _EQN_ is K\" ahlerian. EOS First, we obtain the algebraic conditions under which the manifold _EQN_ is almost Hermitian. EOS Next we get the integrability conditions for the almost complex structure _EQN_, then the conditions under which the associated 2-form is closed. EOS The manifold _EQN_ is K\" ahlerian iff it is almost Kahlerian and the almost complex structure _EQN_ is integrable.	It follows that the family of Kahlerian structures of above type on _EQN_ depends on three essential parameters (one is a certain proportionality factor, the other two are parameters involved in the definition of _EQN_).

EOS Known database systems and algorithms are no longer capable of effectively handling such large data sets. EOS MapReduce is a novel programming paradigm for processing distributable problems over large-scale data using a computer cluster. EOS In this work we explore the MapReduce paradigm from three different angles. EOS We begin by examining a well-known problem in the field of data mining: mining closed frequent itemsets over a large dataset. EOS By harnessing the power of MapReduce, we present a novel algorithm for mining closed frequent itemsets that outperforms existing algorithms. EOS Next, we explore one of the fundamental implications of "Big Data": The data is not known with complete certainty.	A probabilistic database is a relational database with the addendum that each tuple is associated with a probability of its existence.

doc	A spin glass approach to the directed feedback vertex set problem EOS A directed graph (digraph) is formed by vertices and arcs (directed edges) from one vertex to another. EOS A feedback vertex set (FVS) is a set of vertices that contains at least one vertex of every directed cycle in this digraph. EOS The directed feedback vertex set problem aims at constructing a FVS of minimum cardinality. EOS This is a fundamental cycle-constrained hard combinatorial optimization problem with wide practical applications. EOS In this paper we construct a spin glass model for the directed FVS problem by converting the global cycle constraints into local arc constraints, and study this model through the replica-symmetric (RS) mean field theory of statistical physics.	We then implement a belief propagation-guided decimation (BPD) algorithm for single digraph instances.

EOS We predict the occurrence of a peak at the frequency of the rotation of the rotating antiferromagnetic order parameter.	The doping dependence of this frequency is very similar to that of the frequency of the magnetic resonance observed in the neutron-scattering experiments for the hole-doped high- _EQN_ cuprates.
doc	Recollements, Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebras and Gorenstein projective conjecture EOS It is shown that a 4-recollement of derived categories of CM-finite algebras induces a 2-recollement of the corresponding Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebras, which generalises the main theorem of Pan [S. EOS Y. EOS Pan, Derived equivalences for Cohen-Macaulay Auslander algebras, J. EOS Pure Appl. EOS Algebra 216 (2012), 355 363].	Moreover, both Auslander- Reiten conjecture and Gorenstein projective conjecture are shown invariant under 3 (or 4)-recollement of unbounded derived categories of algebras.

doc	Fast Fourier single-pixel imaging using binary illumination EOS Fourier single-pixel imaging (FSI) has proven capable of reconstructing high-quality two-dimensional and three-dimensional images. EOS The utilization of the sparsity of natural images in Fourier domain allows high-resolution images to be reconstructed from far fewer measurements than effective image pixels.	However, applying original FSI in digital micro-mirror device (DMD) based high-speed imaging system turns out to be challenging, because the original FSI uses grayscale Fourier basis patterns for illumination while DMDs generate grayscale patterns at a relatively low rate.
doc	Mean-field message-passing equations in the Hopfield model and its generalizations EOS Motivated by recent progress in using restricted Boltzmann machines as preprocessing algorithms for deep neural network, we revisit the mean-field equations (belief-propagation and TAP equations) in the best understood such machine, namely the Hopfield model of neural networks, and we explicit how they can be used as iterative message-passing algorithms, providing a fast method to compute the local polarizations of neurons. EOS In the "retrieval phase" where neurons polarize in the direction of one memorized pattern, we point out a major difference between the belief propagation and TAP equations: the set of belief propagation equations depends on the pattern which is retrieved, while one can use a unique set of TAP equations. EOS This makes the latter method much better suited for applications in the learning process of restricted Boltzmann machines. EOS In the case where the patterns memorized in the Hopfield model are not independent, but are correlated through a combinatorial structure, we show that the TAP equations have to be modified.	This modification can be seen either as an alteration of the reaction term in TAP equations, or, more interestingly, as the consequence of message passing on a graphical model with several hidden layers, where the number of hidden layers depends on the depth of the correlations in the memorized patterns.
doc	Strange meson form factors in holographic QCD EOS We consider the electromagnetic form factors of strange vector, axial vector and pseudoscalar mesons in a holographic QCD model. EOS We find the charge radius of charged kaon agrees with the experiment, while the charge radius of charged pion is a little bit smaller than the experimental value, as obtained in other calculations in the hard-wall holographic QCD models. EOS The charge radii of charged rho and _EQN_ quantitatively agree with a recent Dyson-Schwinger equation calculation. EOS We also present the electric form factors of vector, axial vector and pseudoscalar mesons in both space-like and time-like regions.	We find the charged kaon form factor is in agreement with the experiment data.
doc	Learned reconstructions for practical mask-based lensless imaging EOS Mask-based lensless imagers are smaller and lighter than traditional lensed cameras. EOS In these imagers, the sensor does not directly record an image of the scene; EOS rather, a computational algorithm reconstructs it. EOS Typically, mask-based lensless imagers use a model-based reconstruction approach that suffers from long compute times and a heavy reliance on both system calibration and heuristically chosen denoisers. EOS In this work, we address these limitations using a bounded-compute, trainable neural network to reconstruct the image. EOS We leverage our knowledge of the physical system by unrolling a traditional model-based optimization algorithm, whose parameters we optimize using experimentally gathered ground-truth data.	Optionally, images produced by the unrolled network are then fed into a jointly-trained denoiser.

Two stripped-envelope supernovae from low-mass progenitors in NGC 5806 EOS We investigate two stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 5806 by the (i)PTF.	These SNe, designated PTF12os/SN 2012P and iPTF13bvn, exploded at a similar distance from the host-galaxy center.
doc	Mixing induced by a bubble swarm rising through incident turbulence EOS This work describes an experimental investigation on the mixing induced by a swarm of high Reynolds number air bubbles rising through a nearly homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow. EOS The gas volume fraction _EQN_ and the velocity fluctuations _EQN_ of the carrier flow before bubble injection are varied, respectively, in the ranges _EQN_ and 2.3 cm/s _EQN_ cm/s, resulting in a variation of the bubblance parameter _EQN_ in the range [0, 1.3] (_EQN_, where _EQN_ is the relative rising velocity). EOS Mixing in the horizontal direction can be modelled as a diffusive process, with an effective diffusivity _EQN_. EOS Two different diffusion regimes are observed experimentally, depending on the turbulence intensity.	At low turbulence levels, _EQN_ increases with gas volume fraction _EQN_, while at high turbulence levels the enhancement in _EQN_ is negligible.
doc	Gamma rays from clusters of galaxies EOS The search for gamma radiation in clusters of galaxies represents a precious tool to investigate the history of these large scale structures. EOS Clusters or sources within them accelerate cosmic rays, as demonstrated by the detection of radio halos, hard X-rays and UV emission, and confine them over cosmological time scales. EOS Nonthermal and thermal phenomena may be closely related and observations of gamma rays may tell us about this link.	In this paper we review the physics of cosmic ray acceleration and confinement in clusters of galaxies and the related gamma ray signatures.

EOS The essential properties of these pairs (number, minimal energy, cooling energy, distribution with energy) and of their emission (peak flux, spectral breaks, spectral slope) are set by the observables GeV fluence Phi (t) = Ft and spectrum, and by the Lorentz factor Gamma and magnetic field B of the source of high-energy photons, at observer-time t.	Optical and X-ray pseudo--light-curves F_nu (Gamma) are calculated for given B;
doc	Ontology Reasoning with Deep Neural Networks EOS The ability to conduct logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of intelligent behavior, and thus an important problem along the way to human-level artificial intelligence. EOS Traditionally, symbolic logic-based methods from the field of knowledge representation and reasoning have been used to equip agents with capabilities that resemble human logical reasoning qualities. EOS More recently, however, there has been an increasing interest in using machine learning rather than symbolic logic-based formalisms to tackle these tasks. EOS In this paper, we employ state-of-the-art methods for training deep neural networks to devise a novel model that is able to learn how to effectively perform logical reasoning in the form of basic ontology reasoning. EOS This is an important and at the same time very natural logical reasoning task, which is why the presented approach is applicable to a plethora of important real-world problems.	We present the outcomes of several experiments, which show that our model learned to perform precise ontology reasoning on diverse and challenging tasks.
doc	Reconstruction of the equilibrium of the plasma in a Tokamak and identification of the current density profile in real time EOS The reconstruction of the equilibrium of a plasma in a Tokamak is a free boundary problem described by the Grad-Shafranov equation in axisymmetric configuration.

This paper deals with the identification of this nonlinearity source from experimental measurements in real time.
doc	Lower and Upper Conditioning in Quantum Bayesian Theory EOS Updating a probability distribution in the light of new evidence is a very basic operation in Bayesian probability theory. EOS It is also known as state revision or simply as conditioning. EOS This paper recalls how locally updating a joint state can equivalently be described via inference using the channel extracted from the state (via disintegration). EOS This paper also investigates the quantum analogues of conditioning, and in particular the analogues of this equivalence between updating a joint state and inference. EOS The main finding is that in order to obtain a similar equivalence, we have to distinguish two forms of quantum conditioning, which we call lower and upper conditioning.	They are known from the literature, but the common framework in which we describe them and the equivalence result are new.
doc	Late-time evolution of charged massive Dirac fields in the Kerr-Newman background EOS We investigate both the intermediate late-time tail and the asymptotic tail behavior of the charged massive Dirac fields in the background of the Kerr-Newman black hole. EOS We find that the intermediate late-time behavior of charged massive Dirac fields is dominated by an inverse power-law decaying tail without any oscillation, which is different from the oscillatory decaying tails of the scalar field.	We note that the dumping exponent depends not only on the angular quantum numbers _EQN_, the separation constant _EQN_ and the rotating parameter _EQN_, but also on the product _EQN_ of the spin weight of the Dirac field and the charges of the black hole and the fields.
doc	The Bernstein-Sato _EQN_ -function of the Vandermonde determinant EOS The Bernstein-Sato polynomial, or the _EQN_ -function, is an important invariant of singularities of hypersurfaces that is difficult to compute in general. EOS We describe a few different results towards computing the _EQN_ -function of the Vandermonde determinant _EQN_. EOS We use a result of Opdam to produce a lower bound for the _EQN_ -function of _EQN_. EOS This bound proves a conjecture of Budur, Musta\c t \u a, and Teitler for the case of finite Coxeter hyperplane arrangements, proving the Strong Monodromy Conjecture in this case.	In our second set of results, we show the duality of two _EQN_ -modules, and conclude that the roots of the _EQN_ -function of _EQN_ are symmetric about _EQN_.
doc	Binary post-AGB stars as tracers of stellar evolution EOS In this chapter the focus is on the properties of post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars in binary systems. EOS Their Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) are very characteristic: they show a near-infrared excess, indicative of the presence of warm dust, while the central stars are too hot to be in a dust-production evolutionary phase. EOS This allows for an efficient detection of binary post-AGB candidates. EOS It is now well established that the near-infrared excess is produced by the inner rim of a stable dusty disc that surrounds the binary system.	These discs are scaled-up versions of protoplanetary discs and form a second generation of stable Keplerian discs.

EOS Assume that there is a block box that produces bits according to some unknown computable distribution on the binary tree. EOS We know first _EQN_ bits _EQN_. EOS We want to know the probability of the event that that the next bit is equal to _EQN_. EOS Solomonoff suggested to use universal semimeasure _EQN_ for solving this task.	He proved that for every computable distribution _EQN_ and for every _EQN_ the following holds: _EQN_ However, Solomonoff's method has a negative aspect: Hutter and Muchnik proved that there are an universal semimeasure _EQN_, computable distribution _EQN_ and a random (in Martin-L \"o f sense) sequence _EQN_ such that _EQN_.
doc	Mechanical Aspect of Chirality and its Biological Significance EOS Chirality is not just a structural artifact in biology but it may provide for a genuine biological advantage. EOS This is due to the phenomenon of chiral interaction (CI) which is described here for mechanical-chiral devices. EOS The main mechanical feature of chiral interaction is its mode of selecting one direction of rotation out of two possible and opposite ones. EOS For example, a given chiral device such as a rotating water sprinkler, rotates in one direction. EOS What does rotate in the opposite direction is the mirror of this given sprinkler. EOS This mode of operation indicates space-time (PT) invariance which causes it to be also time-irreversible. EOS This also causes a chiral device to become non-ergodic on microscopic level.	This prevents certain chiral systems from readily reaching thermal equilibrium, and causes the system to act non-ergodically, which is crucial for living systems as well as for molecular evolution.
doc	Analysis of linear waves near the Cauchy horizon of cosmological black holes EOS We show that linear scalar waves are bounded and continuous up to the Cauchy horizon of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes, and in fact decay exponentially fast to a constant along the Cauchy horizon. EOS We obtain our results by modifying the spacetime beyond the Cauchy horizon in a suitable manner, which puts the wave equation into a framework in which a number of standard as well as more recent microlocal regularity and scattering theory results apply.	In particular, the conormal regularity of waves at the Cauchy horizon - which yields the boundedness statement - is a consequence of radial point estimates, which are microlocal manifestations of the blue-shift and red-shift effects.

Previously no efficient algorithm can decompose 3rd order tensors when the rank is super-linear in the dimension.

doc	Spectroscopic Observation and Analysis of HII regions in M33 with MMT: Temperatures and Oxygen Abundances EOS The spectra of 413 star-forming (or HII) regions in M33 (NGC 598) were observed by using the multifiber spectrograph of Hectospec at the 6.5-m Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT). EOS By using this homogeneous spectra sample, we measured the intensities of emission lines and some physical parameters, such as electron temperatures, electron densities, and metallicities. EOS Oxygen abundances were derived via the direct method (when available) and two empirical strong-line methods, namely, O3N2 and N2. EOS In the high-metallicity end, oxygen abundances derived from O3N2 calibration were higher than those derived from N2 index, indicating an inconsistency between O3N2 and N2 calibrations. EOS We presented a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of gas-phase oxygen abundances in M33 and confirmed the existence of the axisymmetric global metallicity distribution widely assumed in literature. EOS Local variations were also observed and subsequently associated with spiral structures to provide evidence of radial migration driven by arms.	Our O/H gradient fitted out to 1.1 _EQN_ resulted in slopes of _EQN_, _EQN_, and _EQN_ dex _EQN_ utilizing abundances from O3N2, N2 diagnostics, and direct method, respectively.

doc	Minimax experimental design: Bridging the gap between statistical and worst-case approaches to least squares regression EOS In experimental design, we are given a large collection of vectors, each with a hidden response value that we assume derives from an underlying linear model, and we wish to pick a small subset of the vectors such that querying the corresponding responses will lead to a good estimator of the model. EOS A classical approach in statistics is to assume the responses are linear, plus zero-mean i.i.d. EOS Gaussian noise, in which case the goal is to provide an unbiased estimator with smallest mean squared error (A-optimal design). EOS A related approach, more common in computer science, is to assume the responses are arbitrary but fixed, in which case the goal is to estimate the least squares solution using few responses, as quickly as possible, for worst-case inputs. EOS Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two approaches has proven elusive. EOS We address this by proposing a framework for experimental design where the responses are produced by an arbitrary unknown distribution. EOS We show that there is an efficient randomized experimental design procedure that achieves strong variance bounds for an unbiased estimator using few responses in this general model. EOS Nearly tight bounds for the classical A-optimality criterion, as well as improved bounds for worst-case responses, emerge as special cases of this result. EOS In the process, we develop a new algorithm for a joint sampling distribution called volume sampling, and we propose a new i.i.d.	importance sampling method: inverse score sampling.

doc	End-to-End Learned Random Walker for Seeded Image Segmentation EOS We present an end-to-end learned algorithm for seeded segmentation. EOS Our method is based on the Random Walker algorithm, where we predict the edge weights of the underlying graph using a convolutional neural network.

Besides calculating the exact gradient for optimizing these diffusivities, we also propose simplifications that sparsely sample the gradient and still yield competitive results.
doc	Exploring sd-shell nuclei from two- and three-nucleon interactions with realistic saturation properties EOS We study ground- and excited-state properties of all sd-shell nuclei with neutron and proton numbers 8 <= N,Z <= 20, based on a set of low-resolution two- and three-nucleon interactions that predict realistic saturation properties of nuclear matter. EOS We focus on estimating the theoretical uncertainties due to variation of the resolution scale, the low-energy couplings, as well as from the many-body method. EOS The experimental two-neutron and two-proton separation energies are reasonably well reproduced, with an uncertainty range of about 5 MeV. EOS The first excited 2+ energies also show overall agreement, with a more narrow uncertainty range of about 500 keV.	In most cases, this range is dominated by the uncertainties in the Hamiltonian.
doc	Occlusion-Model Guided Anti-Occlusion Depth Estimation in Light Field EOS Occlusion is one of the most challenging problems in depth estimation. EOS Previous work has modeled the single-occluder occlusion in light field and get good results, however it is still difficult to obtain accurate depth for multi-occluder occlusion. EOS In this paper, we explore the multi-occluder occlusion model in light field, and derive the occluder-consistency between the spatial and angular space which is used as a guidance to select the un-occluded views for each candidate occlusion point. EOS Then an anti-occlusion energy function is built to regularize depth map.	The experimental results on public light field datasets have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art light field depth estimation algorithms, especially in multi-occluder areas.

Dynamical properties EOS [Abridged] Recently we have found that a family of models of partially relaxed, anisotropic stellar systems, inspired earlier by studies of incomplete violent relaxation, exhibits some interesting thermodynamic properties. EOS Here we present a systematic investigation of its dynamical characteristics, in order to establish the basis for a detailed comparison with simulations of collisionless collapse, planned for a separate paper.	For a full comparison with the observations of elliptical galaxies, the models should be extended to allow for the presence a sizable dark halo and of significant rotation.

doc	Constraining properties of dusty environments by infrared variability EOS We present model simulations of time-variable infrared (IR) emission from dust as a consequence of variability of the incident radiation. EOS For that we introduce a generalized treatment for temperature variations in a dusty environment, which is not limited to any specific astronomical source. EOS The treatment has been incorporated into a simplified clumpy torus model, with the radial brightness distribution as the main parameter, to study the IR emission of type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN).	We show that any variability signal in the optical is smoothened stronger if the brightness distribution is very extended, and this smoothing strongly depends on wavelength.
doc	On Sparse Channel Estimation EOS Channel Estimation is an essential component in applications such as radar and data communication. EOS In multi path time varying environments, it is necessary to estimate time-shifts, scale-shifts (the wideband equivalent of Doppler-shifts), and the gains/phases of each of the multiple paths. EOS With recent advances in sparse estimation (or "compressive sensing"), new estimation techniques have emerged which yield more accurate estimates of these channel parameters than traditional strategies. EOS These estimation strategies, however, restrict potential estimates of time-shifts and scale-shifts to a finite set of values separated by a choice of grid spacing. EOS A small grid spacing increases the number of potential estimates, thus lowering the quantization error, but also increases complexity and estimation time. EOS Conversely, a large grid spacing lowers the number of potential estimates, thus lowering the complexity and estimation time, but increases the quantization error. EOS In this thesis, we derive an expression which relates the choice of grid spacing to the mean-squared quantization error. EOS Furthermore, we consider the case when scale-shifts are approximated by Doppler-shifts, and derive a similar expression relating the choice of the grid spacing and the quantization error.	Using insights gained from these expressions, we further explore the effects of the choice and grid spacing, and examine when a wideband model can be well approximated by a narrowband model.
doc	Kernel-phase Detection Limits: Hypothesis Testing and the Example of JWST NIRISS Full Pupil Images EOS The James Webb Space Telescope will offer high-angular resolution observing capability in the near-infrared with masking interferometry on NIRISS, and coronagraphic imaging on NIRCam & MIRI. EOS Full aperture kernel-phase based interferometry complements these observing modes, probing for companions at small separations while preserving the telescope throughput. EOS Our goal is to derive both theoretical and operational contrast detection limits for the kernel-phase analysis of JWST NIRISS full-pupil observations by using tools from hypothesis testing theory, applied to observations of faint brown dwarfs with this instrument, but the tools and methods introduced here are applicable in a wide variety of contexts. EOS We construct a statistically independent set of observables from aberration-robust kernel phases. EOS Three detection tests based on these observable quantities are designed and analysed, all guaranteeing a constant false alarm rate for small phase aberrations.	One of these tests, the Likelihood Ratio or Neyman-Pearson test, provides a theoretical performance bound for any detection test.
doc	Block Time Step Storage Scheme for Astrophysical N-body Simulations EOS Astrophysical research in recent decades has made significant progress thanks to the availability of various _EQN_ -body simulation techniques. EOS With the rapid development of high-performance computing technologies, modern simulations have been able to take the computing power of massively parallel clusters with more than _EQN_ GPU cores. EOS While unprecedented accuracy and dynamical scales have been achieved, the enormous amount of data being generated continuously poses great challenges for the subsequent procedures of data analysis and archiving. EOS As an urgent response to these challenges, in this paper we propose an adaptive storage scheme for simulation data, inspired by the block time step integration scheme found in a number of direct _EQN_ -body integrators available nowadays.	The proposed scheme, namely the block time step storage scheme, works by minimizing the data redundancy with assignments of data with individual output frequencies as required by the researcher.
doc	Exploiting Statistical and Structural Features for the Detection of Domain Generation Algorithms EOS Nowadays, malware campaigns have reached a high level of sophistication, thanks to the use of cryptography and covert communication channels over traditional protocols and services. EOS In this regard, a typical approach to evade botnet identification and takedown mechanisms is the use of domain fluxing through the use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). EOS These algorithms produce an overwhelming amount of domain names that the infected device tries to communicate with to find the Command and Control server, yet only a small fragment of them is actually registered. EOS Due to the high number of domain names, the blacklisting approach is rendered useless. EOS Therefore, the botmaster may pivot the control dynamically and hinder botnet detection mechanisms. EOS To counter this problem, many security mechanisms result in solutions that try to identify domains from a DGA based on the randomness of their name. EOS In this work, we explore hard to detect families of DGAs, as they are constructed to bypass these mechanisms. EOS More precisely, they are based on the use of dictionaries so the domains seem to be user-generated. EOS Therefore, the corresponding generated domains pass many filters that look for, e.g.	high entropy strings.

doc	Evolution of V838 Monocerotis during and after the 2002 eruption EOS By fitting the available photometric data on V838 Mon with standard supergiant spectra we have derived principal stellar parameters, i.e. EOS effective temperature, radius and luminosity, and followed the evolution of the object since its discovery in early January 2002. EOS Our analysis shows that the 2002 outburst of V838 Mon consisted of two major phases: pre-eruption which was observed in January 2002 and a major outburst, called eruption, which started in the beginning of February 2002. EOS During pre-eruption the object seemed to be relaxing after an initial event which had presumably taken place in last days of December 2001. EOS The eruption phase, which lasted till mid-April 2002, resulted from a very strong energy burst, which presumably took place in last days of January at the base of the stellar envelope inflated in pre-eruption. EOS The burst produced an energy wave, which was observed as a strong luminosity flash in the beginning of February, followed by a strong mass outflow in form of two shells, which was observed as an expanding photosphere in later epochs. EOS In mid-April, when the outflow became optically transparent and most of its energy radiated away, the object entered the decline phase during which V838 Mon was evolving along the Hayashi track. EOS This we interpret as an evidence that the main energy source during decline was due to gravitational contraction of the object envelope inflated in eruption.	Late in 2002 a dust formation started in the expanding shells which gave rise to a strong infrared excess observed in 2003.
doc	Hole or grain? A Section Pursuit Index for Finding Hidden Structure in Multiple Dimensions EOS Multivariate data is often visualized using linear projections, produced by techniques such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and projection pursuit. EOS A problem with projections is that they obscure low and high density regions near the center of the distribution. EOS Sections, or slices, can help to reveal them. EOS This paper develops a section pursuit method, building on the extensive work in projection pursuit, to search for interesting slices of the data. EOS Linear projections are used to define sections of the parameter space, and to calculate interestingness by comparing the distribution of observations, inside and outside a section. EOS By optimizing this index, it is possible to reveal features such as holes (low density) or grains (high density).	The optimization is incorporated into a guided tour so that the search for structure can be dynamic.

EOS We found that a dust feature at sunward direction was detected starting from the end of September until the beginning of December (our last observation from the Lulin and Calar Alto observatory). EOS Two distinct sunward jet features in the processed images were observed on October 11 and after October 29 until November 2.	In parallel, the CN images reveal two asymmetrical jet features which are nearly perpendicular to the Sun-nucleus direction and this asymmetrical features implies that the comet was in a nearly side-on view in late-October and early-November.
doc	Deep Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Based Recommendations via Multi-goals Abstraction EOS The recommender system is an important form of intelligent application, which assists users to alleviate from information redundancy. EOS Among the metrics used to evaluate a recommender system, the metric of conversion has become more and more important. EOS The majority of existing recommender systems perform poorly on the metric of conversion due to its extremely sparse feedback signal. EOS To tackle this challenge, we propose a deep hierarchical reinforcement learning based recommendation framework, which consists of two components, i.e., high-level agent and low-level agent.	The high-level agent catches long-term sparse conversion signals, and automatically sets abstract goals for low-level agent, while the low-level agent follows the abstract goals and interacts with real-time environment.

The M\"obius symmetry implies energy quantization and undefinability of quantum trajectories, without assigning any prior interpretation to the wave function.

doc	Quantitative and Three-Dimensional Assessment of Holdup Material EOS Nuclear material deposited in equipment, transfer lines, and ventilation systems of a processing facility is usually referred to as holdup. EOS In this work, we propose to use an array of detectors co-axial to the inspected pipe to measure the holdup material. EOS This method is implementable into an automated system capable of crawling on surfaces and pipes of various curvatures, which would enable faster, easier, and more accurate holdup safeguards measurements. EOS We first demonstrated that the current holdup assay procedure could lead to a non-negligible bias in the estimate of special nuclear material mass, due to the simplified assumption of deposited geometry introduced by the Generalized Geometry Holdup (GGH) model. EOS The new approach consists of imaging the inner holdup material by characterizing the detector array's response and unfolding it from the measured light output. EOS Our experimental proof of principle consists of three NaI(Tl) detectors surrounding an aluminum pipe containing two cesium-137(137Cs) sources. EOS We derived the source distribution inside the pipe by first calculating the detector response matrix using a method adaptive to the surface geometry of the object containing the measured holdup material. EOS Creating a matrix of the detector array's measured counts, we then proceed to solve an inverse problem, resulting in an accurately located source position and activity distribution within the response matrix's spatial resolution. EOS We then developed a simulated model of the envisioned experimental setup, which accurately described both the activity and position of the source in 2D.	Finally, we extended our model onto a discretized three-dimensional model of the system, encompassing 36 detectors.
doc	SU(8) family unification with boson-fermion balance EOS We formulate an _EQN_ family unification model motivated by requiring that the theory should incorporate the graviton, gravitinos, and the fermions and gauge fields of the standard model, with boson--fermion balance. EOS Gauge field _EQN_ anomalies cancel between the gravitinos and spin _EQN_ fermions.	The 56 of scalars breaks _EQN_ to _EQN_, with the fermion representation content needed for "flipped" _EQN_ with three families, and with residual scalars in the _EQN_ and _EQN_ representations that break flipped _EQN_ to the standard model.
doc	Fall-back crust around a quark-nova compact remnant I: The degenerate shell case with applications to SGRs, AXPs and XDINs EOS We explore the formation and evolution of debris ejected around quark stars in the Quark Nova scenario, and the application to Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomolous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs).	If an isolated neutron star explodes as a Quark Nova, an Iron-rich shell of degenerate matter forms out of the fall-back (crust) material.
doc	Phase transitions at surfaces, edges, and corners EOS Results of large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of three-dimensional Ising models with edges and corners are reviewed. EOS At the ordinary transition, angle dependent critical exponents are observed, whereas at the surface transition edge and corner critical exponents are non-universal and depend on the details of the model.	The results obtained at the surface transition are compared to exact findings on critical two-dimensional Ising models with different types of defect lines.
doc	The superconductor KxSr(1-x)Fe2As2: Normal state and superconducting properties EOS The normal state and superconducting properties are investigated in the phase diagram of K_xSr_ 1-x Fe_2As_2 for 0<x<1. EOS The ground state upper critical field, H_ c2 (0), is extrapolated from magnetic field dependent resistivity measurements. EOS H_ c2 (0) scales with the critical temperature, T_c, of the superconducting transition.	In the normal state the Seebeck coefficient is shown to experience a dramatic change near a critical substitution of x=0.3.
doc	On the boundedness of generalized Ces\`aro operators on Sobolev spaces EOS For _EQN_ and _EQN_, the generalized Ces\`aro operator _EQN_ and its companion operator _EQN_ defined on Sobolev spaces _EQN_ and _EQN_ (where _EQN_ is the fractional order of derivation and are embedded in _EQN_ and _EQN_ respectively) are studied. EOS We prove that if _EQN_, then _EQN_ and _EQN_ are bounded operators and commute on _EQN_ and _EQN_.	We show explicitly the spectra _EQN_ and _EQN_ and its operator norms (which depend on _EQN_).
doc	Massively Parallel Stencil Strategies for Radiation Transport Moment Model Simulations EOS The radiation transport equation is a mesoscopic equation in high dimensional phase space. EOS Moment methods approximate it via a system of partial differential equations in traditional space-time. EOS One challenge is the high computational intensity due to large vector sizes (1600 components for P39) in each spatial grid point. EOS In this work, we extend the calculable domain size in 3D simulations considerably, by implementing the StaRMAP methodology within the massively parallel HPC framework NAStJA, which is designed to use current supercomputers efficiently.	We apply several optimization techniques, including a new memory layout and explicit SIMD vectorization.
doc	Axial-DeepLab: Stand-Alone Axial-Attention for Panoptic Segmentation EOS Convolution exploits locality for efficiency at a cost of missing long range context. EOS Self-attention has been adopted to augment CNNs with non-local interactions. EOS Recent works prove it possible to stack self-attention layers to obtain a fully attentional network by restricting the attention to a local region. EOS In this paper, we attempt to remove this constraint by factorizing 2D self-attention into two 1D self-attentions. EOS This reduces computation complexity and allows performing attention within a larger or even global region. EOS In companion, we also propose a position-sensitive self-attention design. EOS Combining both yields our position-sensitive axial-attention layer, a novel building block that one could stack to form axial-attention models for image classification and dense prediction.	We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on four large-scale datasets.
doc	From bricks to quasinormal modes: A new perspective on black hole entropy EOS Calculations of black hole entropy based on the counting of modes of a quantum field propagating in a Schwarzschild background need to be regularized in the vicinity of the horizon. EOS To obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking result the short distance cut-off needs to be fixed by hand. EOS In this note we give an argument for obtaining this cut-off in a natural fashion. EOS We do this by modelling the black hole by its set of quasinormal modes. EOS The horizon then becomes a extended region: the quantum ergosphere. EOS The interaction of the quantum ergosphere and the quantum field provides a natural regularization mechanism. EOS The width of the quantum ergosphere provides the right cut-off for the entropy calculation.	We arrive at a dual picture of black hole entropy.
doc	Two Higgs Models for Large Tan Beta and Heavy Second Higgs EOS We study two Higgs models for large _EQN_ and relatively large second Higgs mass. EOS In this limit the second heavy Higgs should have small vev and therefore couples only weakly to two gauge bosons. EOS Furthermore, the couplings to down type quarks can be significantly modified (so long as the second Higgs is not overly heavy). EOS Both these facts have significant implications for search strategies at the LHC and ILC. EOS We show how an effective theory and explicit fundamental two Higgs model approach are related and consider the additional constraints in the presence of supersymmetry or _EQN_ flavor symmetries. EOS We argue that the best tests of the two Higgs doublet potential are likely to be measurements of the light Higgs branching fractions.	We show how higher dimension operators that have recently been suggested to raise the light Higgs mass are probably best measured and distinguished in this way.
doc	Pseudogap and weak multifractality in disordered Mott charge-density-wave insulator EOS The competition, coexistence and cooperation of various orders in low-dimensional materials like spin, charge, topological orders and charge-density-wave has been one of the most intriguing issues in condensed matter physics. EOS In particular, layered transition metal dichalcogenides provide an ideal platform for studying such an interplay with a notable case of 1 _EQN_ -TaS _EQN_ featuring Mott-insulating ground state, charge-density-wave, spin frustration and emerging superconductivity together.	We investigated local electronic states of Se-substituted 1 _EQN_ -TaS _EQN_ by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), where superconductivity emerges from the unique Mott-CDW state.

doc	Weak uniqueness for SDEs driven by supercritical stable processes with Holder drifts EOS In this paper, we investigate stochastic differential equations(SDEs) driven by a class of supercritical _EQN_ -stable process(including the rotational symmetric _EQN_ stable process) with drift _EQN_.	The weak well-posedness is proved, provided that the _EQN_ -H\"older semi-norm of _EQN_ is sufficient small.
doc	Systematics of collective correlation energies from self-consistent mean-field calculations EOS The collective ground-state correlations stemming from low-lying quadrupole excitations are computed microscopically. EOS To that end, the self-consistent mean-field model is employed on the basis of the Skyrme-Hartre-Fock (SHF) functional augmented by BCS pairing.	The microscopic-macroscopic mapping is achieved by quadrupole-constrained mean-field calculations which are processed further in the generator-coordinate method (GCM) at the level of the Gaussian overlap approximation (GOA).
doc	Thermodynamics of Black Holes in Massive Gravity EOS We present a class of charged black hole solutions in an (_EQN_ -dimensional massive gravity with a negative cosmological constant, and study thermodynamics and phase structure of the black hole solutions both in grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble. EOS The black hole horizon can have a positive, zero or negative constant curvature characterized by constant _EQN_. EOS By using Hamiltonian approach, we obtain conserved charges of the solutions and find black hole entropy still obeys the area formula and the gravitational field equation at the black hole horizon can be cast into the first law form of black hole thermodynamics. EOS In grand canonical ensemble, we find that thermodynamics and phase structure depends on the combination _EQN_ in the four dimensional case, where _EQN_ is the chemical potential and _EQN_ is the coefficient of the second term in the potential associated with graviton mass.	When it is positive, the Hawking-Page phase transition can happen, while as it is negative, the black hole is always thermodynamically stable with a positive capacity.
doc	A complete _EQN_ calculation of the Photon + 1 Jet rate in _EQN_ annihilation EOS We present a complete calculation of the photon +~1 jet rate in _EQN_ annihilation up to _EQN_.

doc	Perturbations of elliptic operators in 1-sided chord-arc domains. Part II: Non-symmetric operators and Carleson measure estimates EOS We generalize to the setting of 1-sided chord-arc domains, that is, to domains satisfying the interior Corkscrew and Harnack Chain conditions (these are respectively scale-invariant/quantitative versions of the openness and path-connectedness) and which have an Ahlfors regular boundary, a result of Kenig-Kirchheim-Pipher-Toro, in which Carleson measure estimates for bounded solutions of the equation _EQN_ with _EQN_ being a real (not necessarily symmetric) uniformly elliptic matrix, imply that the corresponding elliptic measure belongs to the Muckenhoupt _EQN_ class with respect to surface measure on the boundary. EOS We present two applications of this result. EOS In the first one we extend a perturbation result recently proved by Cavero-Hofmann-Martell presenting a simpler proof and allowing non-symmetric coefficients. EOS Second, we prove that if an operator _EQN_ as above has locally Lipschitz coefficients satisfying certain Carleson measure condition then _EQN_ if and only if _EQN_.	As a consequence, we can remove one of the main assumptions in the non-symmetric case of a result of Hofmann-Martell-Toro and show that if the coefficients satisfy a slightly stronger Carleson measure condition the membership of the elliptic measure associated with _EQN_ to the class _EQN_ yields that the domain is indeed a chord-arc domain.

doc	On the Design of LIL Tests for (Pseudo) Random Generators and Some Experimental Results EOS NIST SP800-22 (2010) proposes the state of art testing suite for (pseudo) random generators to detect deviations of a binary sequence from randomness. EOS On the one hand, as a counter example to NIST SP800-22 test suite, it is easy to construct functions that are considered as GOOD pseudorandom generators by NIST SP800-22 test suite though the output of these functions are easily distinguishable from the uniform distribution. EOS Thus these functions are not pseudorandom generators by definition. EOS On the other hand, NIST SP800-22 does not cover some of the important laws for randomness. EOS Two fundamental limit theorems about random binary strings are the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). EOS Several frequency related tests in NIST SP800-22 cover the central limit theorem while no NIST SP800-22 test covers LIL.	This paper proposes techniques to address the above challenges that NIST SP800-22 testing suite faces.
doc	Adaptive Nonlinear RF Cancellation for Improved Isolation in Simultaneous Transmit-Receive Systems EOS This paper proposes an active radio frequency (RF) cancellation solution to suppress the transmitter (TX) passband leakage signal in radio transceivers supporting simultaneous transmission and reception. EOS The proposed technique is based on creating an opposite-phase baseband equivalent replica of the TX leakage signal in the transceiver digital front-end through adaptive nonlinear filtering of the known transmit data, to facilitate highly accurate cancellation under a nonlinear TX power amplifier (PA).	The active RF cancellation is then accomplished by employing an auxiliary transmitter chain, to generate the actual RF cancellation signal, and combining it with the received signal at the receiver (RX) low noise amplifier (LNA) input.
doc	LoCuSS: Hydrostatic Mass Measurements of the High- _EQN_ Cluster Sample -- Cross-calibration of Chandra and XMM-Newton EOS We present a consistent analysis of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of an approximately mass-selected sample of 50 galaxy clusters at _EQN_ -- the "LoCuSS High- _EQN_ Sample". EOS We apply the same analysis methods to data from both satellites, including newly developed analytic background models that predict the spatial variation of the Chandra and XMM-Newton backgrounds to _EQN_ and _EQN_ precision respectively. EOS To verify the cross-calibration of Chandra and XMM-Newton-based cluster mass measurements, we derive the mass profiles of the 21 clusters that have been observed with both satellites, extracting surface brightness and temperature profiles from identical regions of the respective datasets. EOS We obtain consistent results for the gas and total hydrostatic cluster masses: the average ratio of Chandra- to XMM-Newton-based measurements of _EQN_ and _EQN_ at _EQN_ are _EQN_ and _EQN_, respectively with an intrinsic scatter of _EQN_ for gas masses and _EQN_ for hydrostatic masses. EOS Comparison of our hydrostatic mass measurements at _EQN_ with the latest LoCuSS weak-lensing results indicate that the data are consistent with non-thermal pressure support at this radius of _EQN_.	We also investigate the scaling relation between our hydrostatic cluster masses and published integrated Compton parameter _EQN_ measurements from the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array.
doc	E-PUR: An Energy-Efficient Processing Unit for Recurrent Neural Networks EOS Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a key technology for emerging applications such as automatic speech recognition, machine translation or image description. EOS Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks are the most successful RNN implementation, as they can learn long term dependencies to achieve high accuracy. EOS Unfortunately, the recurrent nature of LSTM networks significantly constrains the amount of parallelism and, hence, multicore CPUs and many-core GPUs exhibit poor efficiency for RNN inference. EOS In this paper, we present E-PUR, an energy-efficient processing unit tailored to the requirements of LSTM computation.	The main goal of E-PUR is to support large recurrent neural networks for low-power mobile devices.

EOS In this paper we introduce a multi-asset game model that enables cooperation between multiple agents who bargain on sharing K assets, when each player has a different value for each asset. EOS It thus extends the sequential discrete Raiffa solution and the Talmud rule solution to multi-asset cases.	keyword: resource allocation, game theory, Raiffa Bargaining Solution, Aumann Bankruptcy, non-transferable commodities
doc	Macroscopic coherence between quantum condensates formed at different times EOS We demonstrate macroscopic coherence between quantum condensates generated at different times, separated by more than the particle dephasing time. EOS This is possible due to the dressed light-matter nature of exciton-polaritons, which can be injected resonantly by optical excitation at well-defined momenta. EOS We show that the build-up of coherence between condensates depends on the interaction between the particles, particle density, as well as temperature despite the non-equilibrium nature of the condensate, whereas the mass of the particles plays no role in the condensation of resonantly injected polaritons.	This experiment also makes it possible for us to measure directly the large nonlinear phase shift resulting from the polariton-polariton interaction energy.
doc	Measuring Gender Inequalities of German Professions on Wikipedia EOS Wikipedia is a community-created online encyclopedia; EOS arguably, it is the most popular and largest knowledge resource on the Internet. EOS Thus, reliability and neutrality are of high importance for Wikipedia. EOS Previous research  reveals gender bias in Google search results for many professions and occupations. EOS Also, Wikipedia was criticized for existing gender bias in biographies  and gender gap in the editor community [5, 6]. EOS Thus, one could expect that gender bias related to professions and occupations may be present in Wikipedia.	The term gender bias is used here in the sense of conscious or unconscious favoritism towards one gender over another  with respect to professions and occupations.
doc	Holographic entropy and real-time dynamics of quarkonium dissociation in non-Abelian plasma EOS The peak of the heavy quark pair entropy at the deconfinement transition, observed in lattice QCD, suggests that the transition is effectively driven by the increase of the entropy of bound states.	The growth of the entropy with the inter-quark distance leads to the emergent entropic force that induces dissociation of quarkonium states.
doc	Overcoming device unreliability with continuous learning in a population coding based computing system EOS The brain, which uses redundancy and continuous learning to overcome the unreliability of its components, provides a promising path to building computing systems that are robust to the unreliability of their constituent nanodevices. EOS In this work, we illustrate this path by a computing system based on population coding with magnetic tunnel junctions that implement both neurons and synaptic weights. EOS We show that equipping such a system with continuous learning enables it to recover from the loss of neurons and makes it possible to use unreliable synaptic weights (i.e. EOS low energy barrier magnetic memories). EOS There is a tradeoff between power consumption and precision because low energy barrier memories consume less energy than high barrier ones.	For a given precision, there is an optimal number of neurons and an optimal energy barrier for the weights that leads to minimum power consumption.
doc	CMB Constraints on the Holographic Dark Energy Model EOS We calculate the angular scale of the acoustic oscillation from the BOOMERANG and WMAP data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) to constrain the holographic dark energy model recently proposed by Li. EOS We find that only the phantom-like holographic dark energy survives the cosmological tests.	This is, however, inconsistent with the positive energy condition implicitly assumed in constructing Li's model.

doc	A Minimax Converse for Quantum Channel Coding EOS We prove a one-shot "minimax" converse bound for quantum channel coding assisted by positive partial transpose channels between sender and receiver. EOS The bound is similar in spirit to the converse by Polyanskiy, Poor, and Verdu [IEEE Trans. EOS Info.	Theory 56, 2307-2359 (2010)] for classical channel coding, and also enjoys the saddle point property enabling the order of optimizations to be interchanged.
doc	Finding Apparent Horizons in Numerical Relativity EOS This paper presents a detailed discussion of the ``Newton's method'' algorithm for finding apparent horizons in 3+1 numerical relativity. EOS We describe a method for computing the Jacobian matrix of the finite differenced _EQN_ function by symbolically differentiating the finite difference equations, giving the Jacobian elements directly in terms of the finite difference molecule coefficients used in computing _EQN_. EOS Assuming the finite differencing scheme commutes with linearization, we show how the Jacobian elements may be computed by first linearizing the continuum _EQN_ equations, then finite differencing the linearized (continuum) equations.	We find this symbolic differentiation method of computing the _EQN_ Jacobian to be much more efficient than the usual numerical perturbation method, and also much easier to implement than is commonly thought.
doc	Rapid Transport of Glassy Supersolid Helium in Wavy-Rough Nanpores EOS We show that the presumed wavy roughness distributed along the wall of different nanopores (radius: a around 3.5 nm for Vycor or a silica glass;	around 245 nm for porous gold) will induce larger volume flow rates of solid helium (of which there is a minimum) which might explain reported experimental differences of the supersolid fractions observed so far.
doc	Gravitating sphalerons in the Skyrme model EOS We construct self-gravitating axially symmetric sphaleron solutions of the 3+1 dimensional Skyrme model coupled to Einstein gravity. EOS The solutions are static and asymptotically flat, they are characterized by two integers n and m, where n is the winding numbers of the constituents and the second integer m defines type of the solution. EOS These configuration correspond to the chains of charge n Skyrmions and charge -n anti-Skyrmions placed along the axis of symmetry in alternating order. EOS We investigate the dependency of the masses of the gravitating sphalerons on the gravitational coupling. EOS We find new chains of self-gravitating |n| = 1 Skyrmions-anti-Skyrmions (S-A) which emerge at some critical non-zero value of the gravitational coupling and do not have flat space limit. EOS In contrast, the branches of self-gravitating |n| _EQN_ 2 S-A chains emerge from the corresponding flat space configurations. EOS In both cases these branches merge at some maximal value of the effective gravitational coupling the branches of different type.	The branch of gravitating S-A pair extends all the way back to the limit of vanishing coupling constant where solutions approach the corresponding generalised Bartnik-McKinnon solutions.

EOS We briefly summarize several key results from our decade long RXTE monitoring campaign. EOS We then comment on challenges of analyzing the Suzaku data, i.e., improving the aspect correction beyond that of the existing tools, and quantitatively assessing pileup. EOS All of our Suzaku observations (one, by design) occurred at or very near orbital phase 0 (superior conjunction), and hence show evolution in color-color diagrams due to X-ray absorption by material from the wind of the secondary. EOS We present simple partial absorption models for this evolution.	We then compare the Suzaku and RXTE data, and explicitly divide the Fe line region into narrow and broad components.

doc	Ptychographic modulation engine (PME): a low-cost DIY microscope add-on for coherent super-resolution imaging EOS Imaging of biological cells and tissues often relies on fluorescent labels, which offer high contrast with molecular specificity. EOS The use of exogenous labeling agents, however, may alter the normal physiology of the bio-specimens. EOS Complementary to the established fluorescence microscopy, label-free quantitative phase imaging provides an objective morphological measurement tool for bio-specimens and is free of variability introduced by contrast agents. EOS Here we report a simple and low-cost microscope add-on, termed Ptychographic Modulation Engine (PME), for super-resolution quantitative phase imaging. EOS In this microscope add-on module, we attach a diffuser to a 3D-printed holder that can be mechanically moved to different x-y positions. EOS We then use two vibrational motors to introduce random positional shifts to the diffuser. EOS The add-on module can be placed between the objective lens and the specimen in most existing microscope platforms. EOS Thanks to the diffuser modulation process, the otherwise inaccessible high-resolution object information can now be encoded into the captured images.	In the ptychographic phase retrieval process, we jointly recover the complex object wavefront, the complex diffuser profile, and the unknown positional shifts of the diffuser.
doc	Exact recovery of Dirac ensembles from the projection onto spaces of spherical harmonics EOS In this work we consider the problem of recovering an ensemble of Diracs on the sphere from its projection onto spaces of spherical harmonics. EOS We show that under an appropriate separation condition on the unknown locations of the Diracs, the ensemble can be recovered through Total Variation norm minimization. EOS The proof of the uniqueness of the solution uses the method of `dual' interpolating polynomials and is based on, where the theory was developed for trigonometric polynomials.	We also show that in the special case of non-negative ensembles, a sparsity condition is sufficient for exact recovery.

doc	Evidence for a sharp structure variation inside a red-giant star EOS The availability of precisely determined frequencies of radial and non-radial oscillation modes in red giants is finally paving the way for detailed studies of the internal structure of these stars. EOS We look for the seismic signature of regions of sharp structure variation in the internal structure of the CoRoT target HR7349. EOS We analyse the frequency dependence of the large frequency separation and second frequency differences, as well as the behaviour of the large frequency separation obtained with the envelope auto-correlation function. EOS We find evidence for a periodic component in the oscillation frequencies, i.e.	the seismic signature of a sharp structure variation in HR7349.

EOS We have densely packed up to 200 equal spheres in spherical container and up to 150 equal spheres in cube container. EOS All results are rigorous because of a fake sphere trick. EOS It was conjectured impossible to pack 68 equal spheres of radius 1 into a sphere of radius 5.	The serial symmetrical relocation algorithm has proven wrong this conjecture by finding one such packing.

In this respect, our approach is principally different from standard analyses of well-posedness of free evolution in general relativity.

doc	Quantum coherence, quantum Fisher information and teleportation in the Ising-Heisenberg spin chain model of a heterotrimetallic Fe-Mn-Cu coordination polymer with magnetic impurity EOS The effect of non-uniform magnetic fields on the Ising-Heisenberg chain of a heterotrimetallic coordination compound _EQN_, modeling a magnetic impurity on one dimer is studied. EOS This impurity is configured by imposing non-uniform magnetic fields on each sites of _EQN_ th interstitial ionic dimer _EQN_ of the chain model. EOS The quantum coherence and pairwise entanglement between spin-1/2 magnetic _EQN_ ion dimers clearly depend on the site which the impurity is located. EOS It is demonstrated that when the magnetic impurity is considered for one magnetic dimer, by altering Ising nodal exchange interaction and Heisenberg anisotropy parameter of the impurity dimer, the entanglement can be enhanced to the maximal value 1 at a special fixed magnetic field. EOS Moreover, we find that the quantum Fisher information of the model with magnetic impurity behaves considerably different from the original model. EOS Besides of the quantum resources like concurrence, we prove that the quantum Fisher information can be used as new quantum tool for estimating the quantum phase transition in the model under consideration. EOS On the other hand, thermal teleportation can be significantly optimized by adjusting the magnetic impurity, and a strong increase in the average fidelity is observed.	Finally, the magnetic impurity can be manipulated to locally control the thermal entanglement, coherence, quantum Fisher information and teleportation unlike the original model where it is done globally.
doc	Metal Enrichment in the Fermi Bubbles as a Probe of Their Origin EOS The Fermi bubbles are gigantic gamma-ray structures in our Galaxy. EOS The physical origin of the bubbles is still under debate. EOS The leading scenarios can be divided into two categories. EOS One is the nuclear star forming activity similar to extragalactic starburst galaxies and the other is the past active galactic nucleus (AGN) like activity of the Galactic center supermassive black hole. EOS In this paper, we propose that metal abundance measurements will provide an important clue to probe their origin.	Based on a simple spherically symmetric bubble model, we find that the generated metallicity and abundance pattern of the bubbles' gas strongly depend on assumed star formation or AGN activities.

doc	Hydrodynamic simulations unravel the progenitor-supernova-remnant connection in SN 1987A EOS (Abridged) We aim at linking the dynamical and radiative properties of the remnant of SN 1987A to the geometrical and physical characteristics of the parent aspherical SN explosion and to the internal structure of its progenitor star.	We performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations which describe the long-term evolution of SN 1987A from the onset of the SN to the full-fledged remnant at the age of 50 years, accounting for the pre-SN structure of the progenitor star.
doc	Legendrian Weaves: N-graph Calculus, Flag Moduli and Applications EOS We study a class of Legendrian surfaces in contact five-folds by encoding their wavefronts via planar combinatorial structures. EOS We refer to these surfaces as Legendrian weaves, and to the combinatorial objects as N-graphs. EOS First, we develop a diagrammatic calculus which encodes contact geometric operations on Legendrian surfaces as multi-colored planar combinatorics.	Second, we present an algebraic-geometric characterization for the moduli space of microlocal constructible sheaves associated to these Legendrian surfaces.
doc	Multiplicity of nuclear dust lanes and dust lane shocks in the Milky Way bar EOS Aims: We show the existence of a small family of inner-galaxy dust lanes and dust lane standing shocks beyond the two major ones that were previously known to exist Methods: We analyze images of CO emission in the inner regions of the Galaxy Results: The peculiar kinematics of the major dust lane features are repeated in several other distinct instances at l > 0deg, in one case at a contrary location 100 pc above the galactic equator at l > 3degr at the upper extremity of Clump 2. EOS Like the previously-known dust lanes, these new examples are alsoassociated with localized, exceptionally broad line profiles believed to be characteristic of the shredding of neutral gas at the standing dust lane shocks. EOS Conclusions: There may be secondary dust lane and standing shocks in the Milky Way bulge.	The vertical structure provides a temporal sequence for understanding the secular evolution of gas flow in the bar.
doc	Tunable Phases of Moir\'e Excitons in van der Waals Heterostructures EOS Stacking monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides into a heterostructure with a finite twist-angle gives rise to artificial moir\'e superlattices with a tunable periodicity. EOS As a consequence, excitons experience a periodic potential, which can be exploited to tailor optoelectronic properties of these materials. EOS While recent experimental studies have confirmed twist-angle dependent optical spectra, the microscopic origin of moir\'e exciton resonances has not been fully clarified yet. EOS Here, we combine first principle calculations with the excitonic density matrix formalism to study transitions between different moir\'e exciton phases and their impact on optical properties of the twisted MoSe _EQN_ /WSe _EQN_ heterostructure. EOS At angles smaller than 2 _EQN_ we find flat, moir\'e trapped states for inter- and intralayer excitons.	This moir\'e exciton phase drastically changes into completely delocalized states already at 3 _EQN_.
doc	Vacancy-induced spin textures and their interactions in a classical spin liquid EOS Motivated by experiments on the archetypal frustrated magnet SrCr _EQN_ Ga _EQN_ O _EQN_ (SCGO), we study the classical Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore slab (Kagom\'e bilayer) lattice with site-dilution _EQN_. EOS This allows us to address generic aspects of the physics of non-magnetic vacancies in a classical spin liquid. EOS We explicitly demonstrate that the pure (_EQN_) system remains a spin-liquid down to the lowest temperatures, with an unusual non-monotonic temperature dependence of the susceptibility, which even turns diamagnetic for the apical spins between the two kagome layers. EOS For _EQN_ but small, the low temperature magnetic response of the system is most naturally described in terms of the properties of spatially extended spin textures that cloak an "orphan" _EQN_ Cr _EQN_ spin in direct proximity to a pair of missing sites belonging to the same triangular simplex. EOS In the _EQN_ limit, these orphan-texture complexes each carry a net magnetization that is exactly half the magnetic moment of an individual spin of the undiluted system.	Furthermore, we demonstrate that they interact via an entropic temperature dependent pair-wise exchange interaction _EQN_ that has a logarithmic form at short-distances and decays exponentially beyond a thermal correlation length _EQN_.
doc	Six Faint Gamma-ray Pulsars Seen with the Fermi Large Area Telescope -- Towards a Sample Blending into the Background EOS Context: GeV gamma-ray pulsations from over 140 pulsars have been characterized using the Fermi Large Area Telescope, enabling improved understanding of the emission regions within the neutron star magnetospheres, and the contributions of pulsars to high energy electrons and diffuse gamma rays in the Milky Way. EOS The first gamma-ray pulsars to be detected were the most intense and/or those with narrow pulses. EOS Aims: As the Fermi mission progresses, progressively fainter objects can be studied. EOS In addition to more distant pulsars (thus probing a larger volume of the Galaxy), or ones in high background regions (thus improving the sampling uniformity across the Galactic plane), we detect pulsars with broader pulses or lower luminosity.	Adding pulsars to our catalog with inclination angles that are rare in the observed sample, and/or with lower spindown power, will reduce the bias in the currently known gamma-ray pulsar population.
doc	Linear Controller Design for Chance Constrained Systems EOS This paper is concerned with the design of a linear control law for linear systems with stationary additive disturbances. EOS The objective is to find a state feedback gain that minimizes a quadratic stage cost function, while observing chance constraints on the input and/or the state.	Unlike most of the previous literature, the chance constraints (and the stage cost) are not considered on each input/state of the transient response.
doc	Modelling a Particle Detector in Field Theory EOS Particle detector models allow to give an operational definition to the particle content of a given quantum state of a field theory. EOS The commonly adopted Unruh-DeWitt type of detector is known to undergo temporary transitions to excited states even when at rest and in the Minkowski vacuum. EOS We argue that real detectors do not feature this property, as the configuration "detector in its ground state + vacuum of the field" is generally a stable bound state of the underlying fundamental theory (e.g. EOS the ground state-hydrogen atom in a suitable QED with electrons and protons) in the non-accelerated case.	As a concrete example, we study a local relativistic field theory where a stable particle can capture a light quantum and form a quasi-stable state.

doc	One-dimensional weak antilocalization and band Berry phases in HgTe wires EOS We study the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect in the magnetoresistance of narrow HgTe wires fabricated in quantum wells (QWs) with normal and inverted band ordering. EOS Measurements at different gate voltages indicate that the WAL is only weakly affected by Rashba spin-orbit splitting and persists when the Rashba splitting is about zero. EOS The WAL signal in wires with normal band ordering is an order of magnitude smaller than for inverted ones. EOS These observations are attributed to a Dirac-like topology of the energy bands in HgTe QWs. EOS From the magnetic-field and temperature dependencies we extract the dephasing lengths and band Berry phases.	The weaker WAL for samples with a normal band structure can be explained by a non-universal Berry phase which always exceeds \pi, the characteristic value for gapless Dirac fermions.

doc	Real Time Analytics: Algorithms and Systems EOS Velocity is one of the 4 Vs commonly used to characterize Big Data. EOS In this regard, Forrester remarked the following in Q3 2014: "The high velocity, white-water flow of data from innumerable real-time data sources such as market data, Internet of Things, mobile, sensors, click-stream, and even transactions remain largely unnavigated by most firms. EOS The opportunity to leverage streaming analytics has never been greater." Example use cases of streaming analytics include, but not limited to: (a) visualization of business metrics in real-time (b) facilitating highly personalized experiences (c) expediting response during emergencies. EOS Streaming analytics is extensively used in a wide variety of domains such as healthcare, e-commerce, financial services, telecommunications, energy and utilities, manufacturing, government and transportation. EOS In this tutorial, we shall present an in-depth overview of streaming analytics - applications, algorithms and platforms - landscape. EOS We shall walk through how the field has evolved over the last decade and then discuss the current challenges - the impact of the other three Vs, viz., Volume, Variety and Veracity, on Big Data streaming analytics. EOS The tutorial is intended for both researchers and practitioners in the industry.	We shall also present state-of-the-affairs of streaming analytics at Twitter.

The charge corresponding to BRST symmetry derived from this solution in terms of the phase space variables by using the Noether procedure, and the one found due to the BFV-method are compared and found to coincide.
doc	Algorithms for Batch Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning EOS Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) exploits temporal abstraction to solve large Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and provide transferable subtask policies. EOS In this paper, we introduce an off-policy HRL algorithm: Hierarchical Q-value Iteration (HQI). EOS We show that it is possible to effectively learn recursive optimal policies for any valid hierarchical decomposition of the original MDP, given a fixed dataset collected from a flat stochastic behavioral policy.	We first formally prove the convergence of the algorithm for tabular MDP.

doc	Security challenges in mobile ad hoc networks:a survey EOS MANET is a kind of Ad hoc network with mobile, wireless nodes. EOS Because of its special characteristics like dynamic topology, hop-by-hop communications and easy and quick setup, MANET faced lots of challenges allegorically routing, security and clustering. EOS The security challenges arise due to MANETs self-configuration and self-maintenance capabilities. EOS In this paper, we present an elaborate view of issues in MANET security. EOS Based on MANETs special characteristics, we define three security parameters for MANET.	In addition we divided MANET security into two different aspects and discussed each one in details.
doc	The evolution of pebble size and shape in space and time EOS We propose a mathematical model which suggests that the two main geological observations about shingle beaches, i.e. EOS the emergence of predominant pebble size ratios and strong segregation by size are interrelated. EOS Our model is a based on a system of ODEs called the box equations, describing the evolution of pebble ratios. EOS We derive these ODEs as a heuristic approximation of Bloore's PDE describing collisional abrasion. EOS While representing a radical simplification of the latter, our system admits the inclusion of additional terms related to frictional abrasion.	We show that nontrivial attractors (corresponding to predominant pebble size ratios) only exist in the presence of friction.
doc	Formalizing Mathematical Knowledge as a Biform Theory Graph: A Case Study EOS A biform theory is a combination of an axiomatic theory and an algorithmic theory that supports the integration of reasoning and computation.

doc	Taxonomy and Light-Curve Data of 1000 Serendipitously Observed Main-Belt Asteroids EOS We present VRI spectrophotometry of 1003 Main-Belt Asteroids (MBAs) observed with the Sutherland, South Africa, node of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet). EOS All of the observed MBAs were serendipitously captured in KMTNet's large 2deg _EQN_ 2deg field of view during a separate targeted near-Earth Asteroid study (Erasmus et al 2017). EOS Our broadband spectrophotometry is reliable enough to distinguish among four asteroid taxonomies and we confidently categorize 836 of the 1003 observed targets as either a S-, C-, X-, or D-type asteroid by means of a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm approach.	Our data show that the ratio between S-type MBAs and (C+X+D)-type MBAs, with H magnitudes between 12 and 18 (12 km _EQN_ diameter _EQN_ 0.75 km), is almost exactly 1:1.

doc	Observing collisions beyond the secular approximation limit EOS Energy transfer through quantum coherences plays an essential role in diverse natural phenomena and technological applications, such as human vision, light-harvesting complexes, quantum heat engines, and quantum information and computing. EOS The understanding of the long-lived coherence involved in these phenomena requires a detailed modeling of the system-bath interactions beyond the so-called secular and/or Markovian approximations. EOS Despite continuous theoretical progress on understanding nonsecular dynamics in the last decades, convincing experimental observations are still lacking.	By using the laser-kicked molecular rotor as a model system, we here experimentally unveil the nonsecular dynamics in the rotational relaxation of molecules due to thermal collisions.
doc	Up to one approximations of sectional category and topological complexity EOS James' sectional category and Farber's topological complexity are studied in a general and unified framework. EOS We introduce `relative' and `strong relative' forms of the category for a map. EOS We show that both can differ from sectional category just by 1. EOS A map has sectional or relative category less than or equal to _EQN_ if, and only if, it is `dominated' (in some sense) by a map with strong relative category less than or equal to _EQN_. EOS A homotopy pushout can increase sectional category but neither homotopy pushouts, nor homotopy pullbacks, can increase (strong) relative category.	This makes (strong) relative category a convenient tool to study sectional category.
doc	A panchromatic review of thermal and nonthermal active galactic nuclei EOS The first short part of this review is a general, but very detailed, critique of the literature advocating a class of Seyfert galaxies intrinsically lacking broad emission lines. EOS My conclusion is that there is little or no evidence for such objects. EOS Panchromatic properties of all types of radio loud AGN are then reviewed in detail. EOS Radio galaxies usually show subparsec-scale radio core sources, jets, and a pair of giant radio lobes. EOS The optical spectra sometimes show only relatively weak lines of low-ionization ionic species, and no clear nuclear continuum in the optical or UV region of the spectrum. EOS Some show strong high-ionization narrow lines. EOS Finally, a few radio galaxies add broad bases onto the permitted lines. EOS These spectral categories are the same as those for radio-quiet AGN and quasars. EOS By the 1980s, data from optical polarization and statistics of the radio properties required that many narrow line radio galaxies do in fact produce strong optical/UV continuum. EOS This continuum and the broad line emission are hidden from the line of sight by dusty, roughly toroidal gas distributions, but they are seen in polarized flux. EOS The radio galaxies with hidden quasars are referred to as "thermal." Do all radio galaxies harbor hidden quasars? EOS We now know the answer using the radio, infrared, optical and X-ray properties. EOS Near the top of the radio luminosity function, for FRII, GPS, and CSS galaxies, the answer is yes. EOS At somewhat lower luminosities, many do not. EOS At the lowest radio luminosities, most do not. EOS Instead these "nonthermal" weakly-accreting galaxies manifest their energetic output only as kinetic energy in the form of synchrotron jets. EOS This applies to all types of radio galaxies, big FR II doubles, as well as the small young GPS and CSS sources.	Only a few FR I sources are of the thermal type.
doc	Adaptive 360 VR Video Streaming: Divide and Conquer! EOS While traditional multimedia applications such as games and videos are still popular, there has been a significant interest in the recent years towards new 3D media such as 3D immersion and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, especially 360 VR videos. EOS 360 VR video is an immersive spherical video where the user can look around during playback. EOS Unfortunately, 360 VR videos are extremely bandwidth intensive, and therefore are difficult to stream at acceptable quality levels. EOS In this paper, we propose an adaptive bandwidth-efficient 360 VR video streaming system using a divide and conquer approach. EOS In our approach, we propose a dynamic view-aware adaptation technique to tackle the huge streaming bandwidth demands of 360 VR videos. EOS We spatially divide the videos into multiple tiles while encoding and packaging, use MPEG-DASH SRD to describe the spatial relationship of tiles in the 360-degree space, and prioritize the tiles in the Field of View (FoV). EOS In order to describe such tiled representations, we extend MPEG-DASH SRD to the 3D space of 360 VR videos. EOS We spatially partition the underlying 3D mesh, and construct an efficient 3D geometry mesh called hexaface sphere to optimally represent a tiled 360 VR video in the 3D space.	Our initial evaluation results report up to 72% bandwidth savings on 360 VR video streaming with minor negative quality impacts compared to the baseline scenario when no adaptations is applied.
doc	Kohn-Sham theory of rotating dipolar Fermi gas in two dimensions EOS A two-dimensional dipolar Fermi gas in harmonic trap under rotation is studied by solving "ab initio" Kohn-Sham equations. EOS The physical parameters used match those of ultracold gas of fermionic _EQN_ molecules, a prototype system of strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter, which has been created very recently. EOS We find that, as the critical rotational frequency is approached and the system collapses into the lowest Landau level, an array of tightly packed quantum vortices develops, in spite of the non-superfluid character of the system. EOS In this state the system looses axial symmetry, and the fermionic cloud boundaries assume an almost perfect square shape.	At higher values of the filling factor the vortex lattice disappears, while the system still exhibits square-shaped boundaries.
doc	Spaces which invert weak homotopy equivalences EOS It is well known that if _EQN_ is a CW-complex, then for every weak homotopy equivalence _EQN_, the map _EQN_ induced in homotopy classes is a bijection. EOS For which spaces _EQN_ is _EQN_ a bijection for every weak equivalence _EQN_?	This question was considered by J.
doc	Enhancement in Entanglement Growth due to the Breaking of Translational Symmetry EOS Information, unlike energy or matter, can leak out of a sub-system to its environment not only due to leaking out of particles from the sub-system to the environment, but also due to leaking in of particles to the sub-system from the environment.	We show, this leads to a striking phenomenon --within a simple setup of free-fermions on a one-dimensional lattice, the breaking of the translational symmetry (TS) may lead to enhancement of information leakage from a sub-system to the environment, though the local correlations show slower propagation upon breaking of the TS as expected.
doc	Deep Trustworthy Knowledge Tracing EOS Knowledge tracing (KT), a key component of an intelligent tutoring system, is a machine learning technique that estimates the mastery level of a student based on his/her past performance. EOS The objective of KT is to predict a student's response to the next question. EOS Compared with traditional KT models, deep learning-based KT (DLKT) models show better predictive performance because of the representation power of deep neural networks. EOS Various methods have been proposed to improve the performance of DLKT, but few studies have been conducted on the reliability of DLKT. EOS In this work, we claim that the existing DLKTs are not reliable in real education environments. EOS To substantiate the claim, we show limitations of DLKT from various perspectives such as knowledge state update failure, catastrophic forgetting, and non-interpretability.	We then propose a novel regularization to address these problems.
doc	A refinement of Rasmussen's s-invariant EOS In a previous paper we constructed a spectrum-level refinement of Khovanov homology.

doc	How to Quantize Phases and Moduli! EOS A typical classical interference pattern of two waves with intensities I_1, I_2 and relative phase phi = phi_2-phi_1 may be characterized by the 3 observables p = sqrt I_1 I_2, p cos\phi and -p sin\phi. EOS They are, e.g. EOS the starting point for the semi-classical operational approach by Noh, Fougeres and Mandel (NFM) to the old and notorious phase problem in quantum optics. EOS Following a recent group theoretical quantization of the symplectic space S = (phi in R mod 2pi, p > 0) in terms of irreducible unitary representations of the group SO(1,2) the present paper applies those results to that controversial problem of quantizing moduli and phases of complex numbers: The Poisson brackets of the classical observables p cos\phi, -p sin\phi and p > 0 form the Lie algebra of the group SO(1,2). EOS The corresponding self-adjoint generators K_1, K_2 and K_3 of that group may be obtained from its irreducible unitary representations. EOS For the positive discrete series the modulus operator K_3 has the spectrum k+n, n = 0, 1,2,...; EOS k > 0.	Self-adjoint operators for cos phi and sin phi can be defined as ((1/K_3)K_1 + K_1/K_3)/2 and -((1/K_3)K_2 + K_2/K_3)/2 which have the theoretically desired properties for k > or = 0.5.

doc	Sparsity of Hawking Radiation in _EQN_ Space-Time Dimensions Including Particle Masses EOS Hawking radiation from an evaporating black hole has often been compared to black body radiation. EOS However, this comparison misses an important feature of Hawking radiation: Its low density of states.

In this letter we shall present both the concept of sparsities and its application to _EQN_ -dimensional Tangherlini black holes and their evaporation.
doc	Distributed Slicing in Dynamic Systems EOS Peer to peer (P2P) systems are moving from application specific architectures to a generic service oriented design philosophy. EOS This raises interesting problems in connection with providing useful P2P middleware services that are capable of dealing with resource assignment and management in a large-scale, heterogeneous and unreliable environment. EOS One such service, the slicing service, has been proposed to allow for an automatic partitioning of P2P networks into groups (slices) that represent a controllable amount of some resource and that are also relatively homogeneous with respect to that resource, in the face of churn and other failures. EOS In this report we propose two algorithms to solve the distributed slicing problem. EOS The first algorithm improves upon an existing algorithm that is based on gossip-based sorting of a set of uniform random numbers.	We speed up convergence via a heuristic for gossip peer selection.
doc	On Maximum a Posteriori Estimation of Hidden Markov Processes EOS We present a theoretical analysis of Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) sequence estimation for binary symmetric hidden Markov processes. EOS We reduce the MAP estimation to the energy minimization of an appropriately defined Ising spin model, and focus on the performance of MAP as characterized by its accuracy and the number of solutions corresponding to a typical observed sequence. EOS It is shown that for a finite range of sufficiently low noise levels, the solution is uniquely related to the observed sequence, while the accuracy degrades linearly with increasing the noise strength.	For intermediate noise values, the accuracy is nearly noise-independent, but now there are exponentially many solutions to the estimation problem, which is reflected in non-zero ground-state entropy for the Ising model.
doc	High Dimensional Model Explanations: an Axiomatic Approach EOS Complex black-box machine learning models are regularly used in critical decision-making domains.

doc	Probing the magnetic field in the GW170817 outflow using H.E.S.S. observations EOS The detection of the first electromagnetic counterpart to the binary neutron star (BNS) merger remnant GW170817 established the connection between short _EQN_ -ray bursts and BNS mergers. EOS It also confirmed the forging of heavy elements in the ejecta (a so-called kilonova) via the r-process nucleosynthesis. EOS The appearance of non-thermal radio and X-ray emission, as well as the brightening, which lasted more than 100 days, were somewhat unexpected. EOS Current theoretical models attempt to explain this temporal behavior as either originating from a relativistic off-axis jet or a kilonova-like outflow. EOS In either scenario, there is some ambiguity regarding how much energy is transported in the non-thermal electrons versus the magnetic field of the emission region. EOS Combining the VLA (radio) and Chandra (X-ray) measurements with observations in the GeV-TeV domain can help break this ambiguity, almost independently of the assumed origin of the emission. EOS Here we report for the first time on deep H.E.S.S. EOS observations of GW170817 / GRB 170817A between 124 and 272 days after the BNS merger with the full H.E.S.S. EOS array of telescopes, as well as on an updated analysis of the prompt (<5 days) observations with the upgraded H.E.S.S. EOS phase-I telescopes.	We discuss implications of the H.E.S.S.

In particular, we introduce a learning-based framework for dynamic placement of parallel threads to Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architectures.
doc	Kolmogorov complexity of sequences of random numbers generated in Bell's experiments EOS Quantum systems are the ultimate touchstone for the production of random sequences of numbers.

This is the basis of Quantum Key Distribution.
doc	First Observation of Multiple Transverse Wobbling Bands of Different Kinds in _EQN_ Au EOS We report the first observation of two wobbling bands in _EQN_ Au, both of which were interpreted as the transverse wobbling (TW) band but with different behavior of their wobbling energies as a function of spin. EOS It increases (decreases) with spin for the positive (negative) parity configuration. EOS The crucial evidence for the wobbling nature of the bands, dominance of the _EQN_ component in the _EQN_ transitions between the partner bands, is provided by the simultaneous measurements of directional correlation from the oriented states (DCO) ratio and the linear polarization of the _EQN_ rays. EOS Particle rotor model calculations with triaxial deformation reproduce the experimental data well. EOS A value of spin, _EQN_, has been determined for the observed TW bands below which the wobbling energy increases and above which it decreases with spin.	The nucleus _EQN_ Au is, so far, the only nucleus in which both the increasing and the decreasing parts are observed and thus gives the experimental evidence of the complete transverse wobbling phenomenon.
doc	A Stackelberg Game Perspective on the Conflict Between Machine Learning and Data Obfuscation EOS Data is the new oil; EOS this refrain is repeated extensively in the age of internet tracking, machine learning, and data analytics. EOS As data collection becomes more personal and pervasive, however, public pressure is mounting for privacy protection. EOS In this atmosphere, developers have created applications to add noise to user attributes visible to tracking algorithms. EOS This creates a strategic interaction between trackers and users when incentives to maintain privacy and improve accuracy are misaligned. EOS In this paper, we conceptualize this conflict through an N+1-player, augmented Stackelberg game. EOS First a machine learner declares a privacy protection level, and then users respond by choosing their own perturbation amounts. EOS We use the general frameworks of differential privacy and empirical risk minimization to quantify the utility components due to privacy and accuracy, respectively.	In equilibrium, each user perturbs her data independently, which leads to a high net loss in accuracy.
doc	Applied String Theory EOS This is a review. EOS Comments are welcome. EOS The observation that the structure of string theory is rich enough to include the standard model in rough outline is an old one, starting with the early constructions of free field constructions, orbifold theories, and in particular Calabi-Yau compactifications in the late 1980s and early 1990s. EOS At the time these constructions provided a large collection of different vacua, with thousands of explicitly constructed Calabi-Yau manifolds, and estimates of vast numbers of bosonic models, each one associated with its own moduli space.	It was clear even then that it would be impossible to systematically search this string vacua landscape.

doc	A deep search for metals near redshift 7: the line-of-sight towards ULAS J1120+0641 EOS We present a search for metal absorption line systems at the highest redshifts to date using a deep (30h) VLT/X-Shooter spectrum of the z = 7.084 quasi-stellar object (QSO) ULAS J1120+0641. EOS We detect seven intervening systems at z > 5.5, with the highest-redshift system being a C IV absorber at z = 6.51. EOS We find tentative evidence that the mass density of C IV remains flat or declines with redshift at z < 6, while the number density of C II systems remains relatively flat over 5 < z < 7. EOS These trends are broadly consistent with models of chemical enrichment by star formation-driven winds that include a softening of the ultraviolet background towards higher redshifts. EOS We find a larger number of weak (W_rest < 0.3A) Mg II systems over 5.9 < z < 7.0 than predicted by a power-law fit to the number density of stronger systems. EOS This is consistent with trends in the number density of weak Mg II systems at z = 2.5, and suggests that the mechanisms that create these absorbers are already in place at z = 7.	Finally, we investigate the associated narrow Si IV, C IV, and N V absorbers located near the QSO redshift, and find that at least one component shows evidence of partial covering of the continuum source.
doc	Markowitz portfolio selection for multivariate affine and quadratic Volterra models EOS This paper concerns portfolio selection with multiple assets under rough covariance matrix. EOS We investigate the continuous-time Markowitz mean-variance problem for a multivariate class of affine and quadratic Volterra models. EOS In this incomplete non-Markovian and non-semimartingale market framework with unbounded random coefficients, the optimal portfolio strategy is expressed by means of a Riccati backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). EOS In the case of affine Volterra models, we derive explicit solutions to this BSDE in terms of multi-dimensional Riccati-Volterra equations. EOS This framework includes multivariate rough Heston models and extends the results of REF. EOS In the quadratic case, we obtain new analytic formulae for the the Riccati BSDE and we establish their link with infinite dimensional Riccati equations. EOS This covers rough Stein-Stein and Wishart type covariance models. EOS Numerical results on a two dimensional rough Stein-Stein model illustrate the impact of rough volatilities and stochastic correlations on the optimal Markowitz strategy.	In particular for positively correlated assets, we find that the optimal strategy in our model is a `buy rough sell smooth' one.

doc	X-ray Absorption in Young Core-Collapse Supernova Remnants EOS The material expelled by core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions absorbs X-rays from the central regions. EOS We use SN models based on three-dimensional neutrino-driven explosions to estimate optical depths to the center of the explosion, compare different progenitor models, and investigate the effects of explosion asymmetries. EOS The optical depths below 2 keV for progenitors with a remaining hydrogen envelope are expected to be high during the first century after the explosion due to photoabsorption. EOS A typical optical depth is _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the time since the explosion in units of 10 000 days (_EQN_ 27 years) and _EQN_ the energy in units of keV. EOS Compton scattering dominates above 50 keV, but the scattering depth is lower and reaches unity already at _EQN_ 1000 days at 1 MeV. EOS The optical depths are approximately an order of magnitude lower for hydrogen-stripped progenitors. EOS The metallicity of the SN ejecta is much higher than in the interstellar medium, which enhances photoabsorption and makes absorption edges stronger. EOS These results are applicable to young SN remnants in general, but we explore the effects on observations of SN 1987A and the compact object in Cas A in detail.	For SN 1987A, the absorption is high and the X-ray upper limits of _EQN_ 100 Lsun on a compact object are approximately an order of magnitude less constraining than previous estimates using other absorption models.

doc	Information Diffusion of Topic Propagation in Social Media EOS Real-world social and/or operational networks consist of agents with associated states, whose connectivity forms complex topologies. EOS This complexity is further compounded by interconnected information layers, consisting, for instance, documents/resources of the agents which mutually share topical similarities. EOS Our goal in this work is to predict the specific states of the agents, as their observed resources evolve in time and get updated. EOS The information diffusion among the agents and the publications themselves effectively result in a dynamic process which we capture by an interconnected system of networks (i.e. EOS layered). EOS More specifically, we use a notion of a supra-Laplacian matrix to address such a generalized diffusion of an interconnected network starting with the classical "graph Laplacian".	The auxiliary and external input update is modeled by a multidimensional Brownian process, yielding two contributions to the variations in the states of the agents: one that is due to the intrinsic interactions in the network system, and the other due to the external inputs or innovations.

We obtain in d-dimensions the dual Lagrangian in a closed form in terms of field strength of the dual frame-like field.

doc	Implicit Media Tagging and Affect Prediction from video of spontaneous facial expressions, recorded with depth camera EOS We present a method that automatically evaluates emotional response from spontaneous facial activity recorded by a depth camera. EOS The automatic evaluation of emotional response, or affect, is a fascinating challenge with many applications, including human-computer interaction, media tagging and human affect prediction. EOS Our approach in addressing this problem is based on the inferred activity of facial muscles over time, as captured by a depth camera recording an individual's facial activity. EOS Our contribution is two-fold: First, we constructed a database of publicly available short video clips, which elicit a strong emotional response in a consistent manner across different individuals. EOS Each video was tagged by its characteristic emotional response along 4 scales: ph Valence, Arousal, Likability and ph Rewatch (the desire to watch again). EOS The second contribution is a two-step prediction method, based on learning, which was trained and tested using this database of tagged video clips.	Our method was able to successfully predict the aforementioned 4 dimensional representation of affect, as well as to identify the period of strongest emotional response in the viewing recordings, in a method that is blind to the video clip being watch, revealing a significantly high agreement between the recordings of independent viewers.
doc	Spectrally Resolved Mid-Infrared Molecular Emission from Protoplanetary Disks and the Chemical Fingerprint of Planetesimal Formation EOS We present high resolution spectroscopy of mid-infrared molecular emission from two very active T Tauri stars, AS 205 N and DR Tau. EOS In addition to measuring high signal-to-noise line profiles of water, we report the first spectrally resolved mid-infrared line profiles of HCN emission from protoplanetary disks. EOS The similar line profiles and temperatures of the HCN and water emission indicate that they arise in the same volume of the disk atmosphere, within 1-2AU of the star.	The results support the earlier suggestion that the observed trend of increasing HCN/water emission with disk mass is a chemical fingerprint of planetesimal formation and core accretion in action.

Although anomalous electron transport, the electron drift instability (EDI), and secondary electron emission (SEE) have been studied experimentally and numerically in xenon-based HETs, the impact of alternative propellants is still poorly characterized.
doc	An equivariant index for proper actions III: the invariant and discrete series indices EOS We study two special cases of the equivariant index defined in part I of this series. EOS We apply this index to deformations of Spin _EQN_ -Dirac operators, invariant under actions by possibly noncompact groups, with possibly noncompact orbit spaces. EOS One special case is an index defined in terms of multiplicities of discrete series representations of semisimple groups, where we assume the Riemannian metric to have a certain product form. EOS The other is an index defined in terms of sections invariant under a group action. EOS We obtain a relation with the analytic assembly map, quantisation commutes with reduction results, and Atiyah-Hirzebruch type vanishing theorems.	The arguments are based on an explicit decomposition of Spin _EQN_ -Dirac operators with respect to a global slice for the action.

doc	Interplay between kaon condensation and hyperons in highly dense matter EOS Possible coexistence and/or competition of kaon condensation with hyperons are investigated in hyperonic matter, where hyperons are mixed in the ground state of neutron-star matter. EOS The formulation is based on the effective chiral Lagrangian for the kaon-baryon interaction and the nonrelativistic baryon-baryon interaction model. EOS First, the onset condition of the s-wave kaon condensation realized from hyperonic matter is reexamined. EOS It is shown that the usual assumption of the continuous phase transition is not always kept valid in the presence of the negatively charged hyperons. EOS Second, the equation of state (EOS) of the kaon-condensed phase in hyperonic matter is discussed.	In the case of the stronger kaon-baryon attractive interaction, it is shown that a local energy minimum with respect to the baryon number density appears as a result of considerable softening of the EOS due to both kaon condensation and hyperon-mixing and recovering of the stiffness of the EOS at very high densities.

doc	On-line vertex ranking of trees EOS A _EQN_ -ranking of a graph _EQN_ is a labeling of its vertices from _EQN_ such that any nontrivial path whose endpoints have the same label contains a larger label. EOS The least _EQN_ for which _EQN_ has a _EQN_ -ranking is the ranking number of _EQN_, also known as tree-depth. EOS Applications of rankings include VLSI design, parallel computing, and factory scheduling. EOS The on-line ranking problem asks for an algorithm to rank the vertices of _EQN_ as they are presented one at a time along with all previously ranked vertices and the edges between them (so each vertex is presented as the lone unranked vertex in a partially labeled induced subgraph of _EQN_ whose final placement in _EQN_ is not specified). EOS The on-line ranking number of _EQN_ is the minimum over all such algorithms of the largest label that algorithm can be forced to use.	We give bounds on the on-line ranking number of trees in terms of maximum degree, diameter, and number of interior vertices.

doc	UV and EUV Emissions at the Flare Foot-points Observed by AIA EOS A solar flare is composed of impulsive energy release events by magnetic reconnection, which forms and heats flare loops. EOS Recent studies have revealed a two-phase evolution pattern of UV 1600\AA\ emission at the feet of these loops: a rapid pulse lasting for a few seconds to a few minutes, followed by a gradual decay on timescales of a few tens of minutes. EOS Multiple band EUV observations by AIA further reveal very similar signatures. EOS These two phases represent different but related signatures of an impulsive energy release in the corona.	The rapid pulse is an immediate response of the lower atmosphere to an intense thermal conduction flux resulting from the sudden heating of the corona to high temperatures (we rule out energetic particles due to a lack of significant hard X-ray emission).

doc	Approximate construction of rational approximations and the effect of error autocorrection. Applications EOS Several construction methods for rational approximations to functions of one real variable are described in the present paper; EOS the computational results that characterize the comparative accuracy of these methods are presented; EOS an effect of error autocorrection is considered. EOS This effect occurs in efficient methods of rational approximation (e.g., Pade approximations, linear and nonlinear Pade-Chebyshev approximations) where very significant errors in the coefficients do not affect the accuracy of the approximation. EOS The matter of import is that the errors in the numerator and the denominator of a fractional rational approximant compensate each other. EOS This effect is related to the fact that the errors in the coefficients of a rational approximant are not distributed in an arbitrary way but form the coefficients of a new approximant to the approximated function. EOS Understanding of the error autocorrection mechanism allows to decrease this error by varying the approximation procedure depending on the form of the approximant.	Some applications are described in the paper.
doc	Persistent Currents in Helical Structures EOS Recent discovery of mesoscopic electronic structures, in particular the carbon nanotubes, made necessary an investigation of what effect may helical symmetry of the conductor (metal or semiconductor) have on the persistent current oscillations. EOS We investigate persistent currents in helical structures which are non-decaying in time, not requiring a voltage bias, dissipationless stationary flow of electrons in a normal-metallic or semiconducting cylinder or circular wire of mesoscopic dimension. EOS In the presence of magnetic flux along the toroidal structure, helical symmetry couples circular and longitudinal currents to each other. EOS Our calculations suggest that circular persistent currents in these structures have two components with periods _EQN_ and _EQN_ (_EQN_ is an integer specific to any geometry).	However, resultant circular persistent current oscillations have _EQN_ period.

doc	Activity-induced phase separation and self-assembly in mixtures of active and passive particles EOS We investigate the phase behavior and kinetics of a monodisperse mixture of active (\textit i.e. EOS, self-propelled) and passive isometric Brownian particles through Brownian dynamics simulations and theory. EOS As in a purely active system, motility of the active component triggers phase separation into a dense and a dilute phase; EOS in the dense phase we further find active-passive segregation, with "rafts" of passive particles in a "sea" of active particles. EOS We find that phase separation from an initially disordered mixture can occur with as little as 15 percent of the particles being active. EOS Finally, we show that a system prepared in a suitable fully segregated initial state reproducibly self-assembles an active "corona" which triggers crystallization of the passive core by initiating a compression wave.	Our findings are relevant to the experimental pursuit of directed self-assembly using active particles.

EOS In the present investigation, we study the frequency dependent scattering rate of cuprates (Mitrovic-Fiorucci/ Sharapov-Carbotte scattering rate) in the pseudogap phase using the non-constant energy dependent Yang-Rice-Zhang (YRZ) density of states. EOS First, with the energy dependent density of states, the scattering rate gives the picture of depression formation coming from the opening of the pseudogap.	Second, the evolution of _EQN_ with temperature shows the increase of scattering rate with the temperature at lower frequencies and the temperature independence of _EQN_ at higher frequencies.

To account for the observational data regarding the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, nonlocality is associated with a characteristic length scale of order \lambda_0 = 10 kpc.
doc	Towards Optimality in Transform Coding EOS It is well-known for transform coding of multivariate Gaussian sources, that the Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (KLT) minimizes the mean square error distortion. EOS However, finding the optimal transform for general non-Gaussian sources has been an open problem for decades, despite several important advances that provide some partial answers regarding KLT optimality. EOS In this paper, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality of a transform when high resolution, variable rate quantizers are employed. EOS We hence present not only a complete characterization of when KLT is optimal, but also a determining condition for optimality of a general (non-KLT) transform. EOS This necessary and sufficient condition is shown to have direct connections to the well studied source separation problem. EOS This observation can impact source separation itself, as illustrated with a new optimality result.	We combine the transform optimality condition with algorithmic tools from source separation, to derive a practical numerical method to search for the optimal transform in source coding.
doc	Conjugate Gradient-based Soft-Output Detection and Precoding in Massive MIMO Systems EOS Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) promises improved spectral efficiency, coverage, and range, compared to conventional (small-scale) MIMO wireless systems. EOS Unfortunately, these benefits come at the cost of significantly increased computational complexity, especially for systems with realistic antenna configurations. EOS To reduce the complexity of data detection (in the uplink) and precoding (in the downlink) in massive MIMO systems, we propose to use conjugate gradient (CG) methods. EOS While precoding using CG is rather straightforward, soft-output minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detection requires the computation of the post-equalization signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR). EOS To enable CG for soft-output detection, we propose a novel way of computing the SINR directly within the CG algorithm at low complexity.	We investigate the performance/complexity trade-offs associated with CG-based soft-output detection and precoding, and we compare it to exact and approximate methods.

doc	Boomerang RG flows in M-theory with intermediate scaling EOS We construct novel RG flows of D=11 supergravity that asymptotically approach _EQN_ in the UV with deformations that break spatial translations in the dual field theory. EOS In the IR the solutions return to exactly the same _EQN_ vacuum, with a renormalisation of relative length scales, and hence we refer to the flows as `boomerang RG flows'. EOS For sufficiently large deformations, on the way to the IR the solutions also approach two distinct intermediate scaling regimes, each with hyperscaling violation. EOS The first regime is Lorentz invariant with dynamical exponent _EQN_ while the second has _EQN_. EOS Neither of the two intermediate scaling regimes are associated with exact hyperscaling violation solutions of _EQN_ supergravity. EOS The RG flow solutions are constructed using the four dimensional _EQN_ STU gauged supergravity theory with vanishing gauge fields, but non-vanishing scalar and pseudoscalar fields.	In the ABJM dual field theory the flows are driven by spatially modulated deformation parameters for scalar and fermion bilinear operators.

EOS We account for the soft lags by downscattering of hard X-ray photons in the relatively cold plasma of the disk or NS surface. EOS A fraction of the soft X-ray photons coming from the disk or NS surface upscatter off hot electrons in the accretion column.	This effect leads to hard lags as a result of thermal Comptonization of the soft photons.

This device also has excellent inverter characteristics, making it attractive for applications in low power and high density Boolean logic circuits.

EOS The classical limit dominates the magnetotransport properties for a magnetic field perpendicular to the sample surface and consequently a magnetic-field induced resistivity minimum emerges. EOS While for the field applied in plane and normal to the current, the linear magnetoresistance (MR) starting from small fields (< 0.5 T) appears. EOS The large anisotropy in the transverse MRs reveals the strong surface interlayer scattering due to the large gradient of oxygen vacancy concentration from the surface to the interior of SrTiO3-x single crystals. EOS Moreover, the linear MR in our case was likely due to the inhomogeneity of oxygen vacancies and oxygen vacancy clusters, which could provide experimental evidences for the unusual quantum linear MR proposed by Abrikosov [A.

EOS This simulation yields a set of basis functions that captures 90% of the energy after 2,453 modes. EOS The eigenfunctions are categorised into two classes and six subclasses based on their wavenumber and coherent vorticity structure. EOS Of the total energy, 81% is in the propagating class, characterised by constant phase speeds; EOS the remaining energy is found in the non propagating subclasses, the shear and roll modes. EOS The four subclasses of the propagating modes are the wall, lift, asymmetric, and ring modes. EOS The wall modes display coherent vorticity structures near the wall, the lift modes display coherent vorticity structures that lift away from the wall, the asymmetric modes break the symmetry about the axis, and the ring modes display rings of coherent vorticity. EOS Together, the propagating modes form a wave packet, as found from a circular normal speed locus.	The energy transfer mechanism in the flow is a four step process.

A similar analysis is presented for a longitudinally oscillating gravitational field produced by a vibrating mass.

doc	Magnetic flux concentrations from dynamo-generated fields EOS The mean-field theory of magnetized stellar convection gives rise to the two possibility of distinct instabilities: the large-scale dynamo instability, operating in the bulk of the convection zone, and a negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI) operating in the strongly stratified surface layers. EOS The latter might be important in connection with magnetic spot formation, but the growth rate of NEMPI is suppressed with increasing rotation rates, although recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) have shown a subsequent increase in the growth rate. EOS We examine quantitatively whether this increase in the growth rate of NEMPI can be explained by an alpha squared mean-field dynamo, and whether both NEMPI and the dynamo instability can operate at the same time.	We use both DNS and mean-field simulations (MFS) to solve the underlying equations numerically either with or without an imposed horizontal field.

This is achieved by treating the soil parameters in these models as spatially correlated random fields with appropriately defined marginal distributions.
doc	Electron Localization Enhances Cation Diffusion in Transition Metal Oxides: An Electronic Trebuchet Effect EOS Ion diffusion is a central part of materials physics of fabrication, deformation, phase transformation, structure stability and electrochemical devices. EOS Conventional theory focuses on the defects that mediate diffusion and explains how their populations influenced by oxidation, reduction, irradiation and doping can enhance diffusion. EOS However, we have found the same influences can also elevate their mobility by orders of magnitude in several prototypical transition-metal oxides. EOS First-principles calculation fundamentally connects the latter observation to migrating ion's local structure, which is inherently soft and has a broken symmetry, making it susceptible to electron or hole localization, thereby realizing a lower saddle-point energy. EOS This finding resolves an unanswered question in physical ceramics of the past 30 years: why cation diffusion against the prediction of classical nonstoichiometric defect physics is enhanced in reduced zirconia, ceria and structurally related ceramics? EOS It also suggests the saddle-point electron-phonon interaction that enables a negative-U state is akin to the counterweight effect that enables a trebuchet.	This simple picture for the transitional state explains why enhanced kinetics mediated by radical-like-ion migration occurs often, especially under extreme conditions.
doc	Relationship between Bondi-Sachs quantities and source of gravitational radiation in asymptotically de Sitter spacetime EOS Gravitational radiation plays an important role in astrophysics. EOS Based on the fact that our universe is expanding, the gravitational radiation when a positive cosmological constant is presented has been studied along with two different ways recently, one is the Bondi-Sachs (BS) framework in which the result is shown by BS quantities in the asymptotic null structure, the other is the perturbation approach in which the result is presented by the quadrupoles of source. EOS Therefore, it is worth to interpret the quantities in asymptotic null structure in terms of the information of the source.	In this paper, we investigate this problem and find the explicit expressions of BS quantities in terms of the quadrupoles of source in asymptotically de Sitter spacetime.

EOS We show that its Mahler measure is a rational linear combination of a special L-value of the normalized newform in S_4(Gamma_0(8)) and a Riemann zeta value.	This is equivalent to a new formula for a 6F5-hypergeometric series evaluated at 1.
doc	Multiscale entanglement clusters at the many-body localization phase transition EOS We study numerically the formation of entanglement clusters across the many-body localization phase transition. EOS We observe a crossover from strong many-body entanglement in the ergodic phase to weak local correlations in the localized phase, with contiguous clusters throughout the phase diagram.	Critical states close to the transition have a structure compatible with fractal or multiscale-entangled states, characterized by entanglement at multiple levels: small strongly entangled clusters are weakly entangled together to form larger clusters.
doc	Adaptive System Identification Using LMS Algorithm Integrated with Evolutionary Computation EOS System identification is an exceptionally expansive topic and of remarkable significance in the discipline of signal processing and communication. EOS Our goal in this paper is to show how simple adaptive FIR and IIR filters can be used in system modeling and demonstrating the application of adaptive system identification. EOS The main objective of our research is to study the LMS algorithm and its improvement by the genetic search approach, namely, LMS-GA, to search the multi-modal error surface of the IIR filter to avoid local minima and finding the optimal weight vector when only measured or estimated data are available.	Convergence analysis of the LMS algorithm in the case of coloured input signal, i.e., correlated input signal is demonstrated on adaptive FIR filter via power spectral density of the input signals and Fourier transform of the autocorrelation matrix of the input signal.

EOS In the first lecture, I review the basics of discrete symmetries in field theories, the quantum mechanics of neutral but flavor-non-trivial mesons, and the classification of three types of CP violation. EOS The actual second lecture which I gave will be separately published as it is my Dirac award lecture and is focussed on the separate topic of strong CP Violation. EOS In Lecture 2 here, I cover the Standard Model predictions for neutral B decays, and in particular discuss some channels of interest for CP Violation studies. EOS Lecture 3 reviews the various tools and techniques used to deal with the hadronic physics effects. EOS In Lecture 4, I briefly review the present and planned experiments that can study B decays. EOS I cannot teach all the details of this subject in this short course, so my approach is instead to try to give students a grasp of the relevant concepts and an overview of the available tools. EOS The level of these lectures is introductory. EOS I will provide some references to more detailed treatments and current literature, but this is not a review article so I do not attempt to give complete references to all related literature.	By now there are some excellent textbooks that cover this subject in great detail.
doc	Sentimental LIAR: Extended Corpus and Deep Learning Models for Fake Claim Classification EOS The rampant integration of social media in our every day lives and culture has given rise to fast and easier access to the flow of information than ever in human history. EOS However, the inherently unsupervised nature of social media platforms has also made it easier to spread false information and fake news. EOS Furthermore, the high volume and velocity of information flow in such platforms make manual supervision and control of information propagation infeasible.	This paper aims to address this issue by proposing a novel deep learning approach for automated detection of false short-text claims on social media.

doc	Data-Driven False Data Injection Attacks Against Power Grids: A Random Matrix Approach EOS We address the problem of constructing false data injection (FDI) attacks that can bypass the bad data detector (BDD) of a power grid. EOS The attacker is assumed to have access to only power flow measurement data traces (collected over a limited period of time) and no other prior knowledge about the grid. EOS Existing related algorithms are formulated under the assumption that the attacker has access to measurements collected over a long (asymptotically infinite) time period, which may not be realistic. EOS We show that these approaches do not perform well when the attacker has a limited number of data samples only.	We design an enhanced algorithm to construct FDI attack vectors in the face of limited measurements that can nevertheless bypass the BDD with high probability.

EOS Using the derived _EQN_ CO cube, we have identified 187 high-significance (_EQN_) GMCs by employing the CLUMPFIND algorithm. EOS The molecular gas masses of GMCs _EQN_, derived from the _EQN_ CO data, range from _EQN_ to _EQN_. EOS A mass function of GMCs in NGC 1068 has been obtained for the first time at _EQN_ 100 pc resolution. EOS We find the slope of the mass function _EQN_ for a mass range of _EQN_. EOS This is shallower than the GMCs in the disk regions of the Milky Way, M51 and NGC 300.	Further, we find that the high mass cut-off of the GMC mass function occurs at _EQN_, which is an order of magnitude larger than that in the nuclear bar region of M51, indicating that the more massive clouds dominate the mass budget in NGC 1068.

EOS A total of 28 X-ray/70 micron sources in the redshift interval 0.5<z<1.3 are selected. EOS The X-ray luminosities and the shape of the X-ray spectra show that these sources are AGN. EOS Modelling of the optical to far-infrared Spectral Energy Distribution indicates that most of them (27/28) have a strong starburst component (>50 solar masses per year) that dominates in the infrared. EOS It is found that the X-ray and infrared luminosities of the sample sources are broadly correlated, consistent with a link between AGN activity and star-formation. EOS Contrary to the predictions of some models for the co-evolution of AGN and galaxies, the X-ray/70 micron sources in the sample are not more obscured at X-ray wavelengths compared to the overall X-ray population.	It is also found that the X-ray/70 micron sources have lower specific star-formation rates compared to the general 70 micron population, consistent with AGN feedback moderating the star-formation in the host galaxies.

doc	In vitro toxicity and uptake of magnetic nanorods EOS In this paper we investigate the internalization and cytotoxicity of nanostructured materials having the form of elongated rods, with diameter of 200 nm and lengths 1 - 10 \mu m. EOS The rods were made from the controlled aggregation of sub-10 nm iron oxide nanoparticles. EOS Recently, we have shown that the nanorods inherited the superparamagnetic property of the particles. EOS These rods can actually be moved by the application of an external magnetic field. EOS Here we evaluate the in vitro toxicity of the magnetic nanorods by using MTT assays on NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts. EOS The toxicity assays revealed that the nanorods are biocompatible, as exposed cells remained 100% viable relative to controls over a period of a few days. EOS Optical microscopy allow to visualize the rods inside the cells and to determine their number per cell.	Roughly 1/3 of the total incubated rods were uptaken by the fibroblasts.

EOS The core is capable of operating as a soft-input soft-output log-likelihood ratio (LLR) MIMO detector which can be used in the context of iterative detection and decoding.	High area-efficiency is achieved via algorithmic and architectural optimizations performed at two levels.
doc	A Distributed Model Predictive Wind Farm Controller for Active Power Control EOS Due to the fluctuating nature of the wind and the increasing use of wind energy as a power source, wind power will have an increasing negative influence on the stability of the power grid. EOS In this paper, a model predictive control strategy is introduced that not only stabilizes the power produced by wind farms, but also creates the possibility to perform power reference tracking with wind farms. EOS With power reference tracking, it is possible for grid operators to adapt the power production to a change in the power demand and to counteract fluctuations that are introduced by other power generators. EOS In this way, wind farms can actually contribute to the stabilization of the power grid when this is necessary instead of negatively influencing it. EOS A low-fidelity control-oriented wind farm model is developed and employed in the developed distributed model predictive controller. EOS In this control model, the wake dynamics are taken into account and consequently, the model's order is relatively large. EOS This makes it, from a computational point of view, challenging for a centralized model predictive control to provide real-time control for large wind farms.	Therefore, the controller proposed in this paper is a distributed model predictive control.

doc	Zero-Point Energy Leakage in Quantum Thermal Bath Molecular Dynamics Simulations EOS The quantum thermal bath (QTB) has been presented as analternative to path-integral-based methods to introduce nuclear quantumeffects in molecular dynamics simulations. EOS The method has proved to beefficient, yielding accurate results for various systems. EOS However, the QTBmethod is prone to zero-point energy leakage (ZPEL) in highly anharmonicsystems. EOS This is a well-known problem in methods based on classicaltrajectories where part of the energy of the high-frequency modes istransferred to the low-frequency modes leading to a wrong energydistribution. EOS In some cases, the ZPEL can have dramatic consequences onthe properties of the system. EOS Thus, we investigate the ZPEL by testing theQTB method on selected systems with increasing complexity in order to studythe conditions and the parameters that influence the leakage. EOS We also analyze the consequences of the ZPEL on the structuraland vibrational properties of the system. EOS We find that the leakage is particularly dependent on the damping coefficient and thatincreasing its value can reduce and, in some cases, completely remove the ZPEL. EOS When using sufficiently high values for thedamping coefficient, the expected energy distribution among the vibrational modes is ensured. EOS In this case, the QTB methodgives very encouraging results.	In particular, the structural properties are well-reproduced.

Previous research has shown that applying classical logistic regression with elastic-net penalty to these datasets can lead to poor results (Liu et al, 2018).
doc	Dual-Domain Fusion Convolutional Neural Network for Contrast Enhancement Forensics EOS Contrast enhancement (CE) forensics techniques have always been of great interest for image forensics community, as they can be an effective tool for recovering image history and identifying tampered images. EOS Although several CE forensic algorithms have been proposed, their accuracy and robustness against some kinds of processing are still unsatisfactory. EOS In order to attenuate such deficiency, in this paper we propose a new framework based on dual-domain fusion convolutional neural network to fuse the features of pixel and histogram domains for CE forensics. EOS Specifically, we first present a pixel-domain convolutional neural network (P-CNN) to automatically capture the patterns of contrast-enhanced images in the pixel domain. EOS Then, we present a histogram-domain convolutional neural network (H-CNN) to extract the features in the histogram domain.	The feature representations of pixel and histogram domains are fused and fed into two fully connected layers for the classification of contrast-enhanced images.

EOS Depending on the value of q the distribution increases the tail for small (when _EQN_) or large (when _EQN_) values of the variable upon analysis. EOS The usual log-Normal distribution is retrieved when _EQN_. EOS The main statistical features of this distribution are presented as well as a related random number generators and tables of quantiles of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov.	Lastly, we illustrate the application of this distribution studying the adjustment of a set of variables of biological and financial origin.

EOS We show that any number of independent observers can share the preparation contextual outcome statistics enabled by state ensembles in quantum theory. EOS Furthermore, we show that even in the presence of any amount of white noise, there exists quantum ensembles that enable such shared preparation contextuality.	The findings are experimentally realised by applying sequential unsharp measurements to an optical qubit ensemble which reveals three shared demonstrations of preparation contextuality.

EOS We prove that coherence of purification is always more than the coherence of the system. EOS For a pure state, the coherence of purification is same as the relative entropy of coherence. EOS Furthermore, we show that the difference in the coherence of purification of a quantum state before and after the dephasing can capture residual quantumness. EOS In addition, we show that the entanglement of purification that can be created by incoherent operation between two subsystems is upper bounded by the coherence of purification of the original system. EOS We show that the coherence of purification is a resource in quantum state discrimination process.	In the absence of coherence, entanglement and quantum correlations, the coherence of purification may play an important role in quantum information processing tasks.

EOS We found the first clear evidence of a change in the X-ray spectral index over the passage period, thanks to a broad and sensitive spectral coverage by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. EOS We analysed the joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation epochs with power-law and broken power-law model. EOS We have obtained change in spectral parameters before and after the periastron passage for both models. EOS The spectra get softened after the passage.	The evolution of the spectral index and break energy before and after the periastron may indicate a change in the physical state of shock-accelerated electrons.

EOS A first step to establish or improve a usability process is to perform a process assessment. EOS As this may be costly, an alternative for organizations seeking for lighter assessments, especially small organizations, may be self-assessments. EOS They can be carried out by an organization on its own to assess the capability of its process. EOS Although there are specific assessment methods to assess the usability process, none of them provides a self-assessment method considering the specific characteristics of small organizations. EOS The objective of this research is to propose a method for self-assessing the capability of the usability process in small organizations. EOS The method consists of a usability process reference model, a measurement framework, an assessment model, and a self-assessment process supported by an online tool. EOS Based on systematic mapping studies on usability capability/maturity models and software process self-assessment methods, we identified the specific requirements of such a method. EOS The UPCASE method was systematically developed using a multi-method approach based on the ISO/IEC TR 29110 and ISO/TR 18529 standard. EOS The method has been applied and evaluated with respect to its reliability, usability, comprehensibility and internal consistency through a series of case studies. EOS First results indicate that the method may be reliable.	Feedback also indicates that the method is easy to use and understandable even for non-software process improvement experts.
doc	Visualizing Neural Network Developing Perturbation Theory EOS In this letter, motivated by the question that whether the empirical fitting of data by neural network can yield the same structure of physical laws, we apply the neural network to a simple quantum mechanical two-body scattering problem with short-range potentials, which by itself also plays an important role in many branches of physics. EOS We train a neural network to accurately predict _EQN_ -wave scattering length, which governs the low-energy scattering physics, directly from the scattering potential without solving Schr\"odinger equation or obtaining the wavefunction. EOS After analyzing the neural network, it is shown that the neural network develops perturbation theory order by order when the potential increases.	This provides an important benchmark to the machine-assisted physics research or even automated machine learning physics laws.

doc	Using Discretization for Extending the Set of Predictive Features EOS To date, attribute discretization is typically performed by replacing the original set of continuous features with a transposed set of discrete ones. EOS This paper provides support for a new idea that discretized features should often be used in addition to existing features and as such, datasets should be extended, and not replaced, by discretization. EOS We also claim that discretization algorithms should be developed with the explicit purpose of enriching a non-discretized dataset with discretized values. EOS We present such an algorithm, D-MIAT, a supervised algorithm that discretizes data based on Minority Interesting Attribute Thresholds. EOS D-MIAT only generates new features when strong indications exist for one of the target values needing to be learned and thus is intended to be used in addition to the original data. EOS We present extensive empirical results demonstrating the success of using D-MIAT on _EQN_ benchmark datasets.	We also demonstrate that _EQN_ other discretization algorithms can also be used to generate features that yield improved performance when used in combination with the original non-discretized data.
doc	Radial Velocities of 41 Kepler Eclipsing Binaries EOS Eclipsing binaries are vital for directly determining stellar parameters without reliance on models or scaling relations. EOS Spectroscopically derived parameters of detached and semi-detached binaries allow us to determine component masses that can inform theories of stellar and binary evolution. EOS Here we present moderate resolution ground-based spectra of stars in close binary systems with and without (detected) tertiary companions observed by NASA's Kepler mission and analyzed for eclipse timing variations. EOS We obtain radial velocities and spectroscopic orbits for five single-lined and 35 double-lined systems, and confirm one false positive eclipsing binary.	For the double-lined spectroscopic binaries we also determine individual component masses and examine the mass ratio M_2/M_1 distribution, which is dominated by binaries with like-mass pairs and semi-detached classical Algol systems that have undergone mass transfer.

doc	Dephasing of G-Band Phonons in Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes Probed via Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scattering EOS We have studied the coherent dynamics of G-band phonons in single-walled carbon nanotubes through impulsive stimulated Stokes and anti-Stokes Raman scattering. EOS The probe energy dependence of phonon amplitude as well as preferential occurrence between Stokes and anti-Stokes components in response to chirped-pulse excitation are well explained within our model.	The temperature dependence of the observed dephasing rate clearly exhibits a thermally-activated component, with an activation energy that coincides with the frequency of the radial breathing mode (RBM).
doc	Coupled dynamics of electrons and phonons in metallic nanotubes: current saturation from hot phonons generation EOS We show that the self-consistent dynamics of both phonons and electrons is the necessary ingredient for the reliable description of the hot phonons generation during electron transport in metallic single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). EOS We solve the coupled Boltzmann transport equations to determine in a consistent way the current vs. EOS voltage (IV) curve and the phonon occupation in metallic SWNTs which are lying on a substrate. EOS We find a good agreement with measured IV curves and we determine an optical phonon occupation which corresponds to an effective temperature of several thousands K (hot phonons), for the voltages typically used in experiments. EOS We show that the high-bias resistivity strongly depends on the optical phonon thermalization time.	This implies that a drastic improvement of metallic nanotubes performances can be achieved by increasing the coupling of the optical phonons with a thermalization source.
doc	RXTE Observations of the Vela Pulsar: The X-ray-Optical Connection EOS We report on our analysis of a 300 ks observation of the Vela pulsar with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). EOS The double-peaked, pulsed emission at 2 - 30 keV, which we had previously detected during a 93 ks observation, is confirmed with much improved statistics. EOS There is now clear evidence, both in the spectrum and the light curve, that the emission in the RXTE band is a blend of two separate components. EOS The spectrum of the harder component connects smoothly with the OSSE, COMPTEL and EGRET spectrum and the peaks in the light curve are in phase coincidence with those of the high-energy light curve. EOS The spectrum of the softer component is consistent with an extrapolation to the pulsed optical flux, and the second RXTE pulse is in phase coincidence with the second optical peak.	In addition, we see a peak in the 2-8 keV RXTE pulse profile at the radio phase.

doc	Theory of capillary-induced interactions beyond the superposition approximation EOS Within a general theoretical framework we study the effective, deformation-induced interaction between two colloidal particles trapped at a fluid interface in the regime of small deformations. EOS In many studies, this interaction has been computed with the ansatz that the actual interface configuration for the pair is given by the linear superposition of the interface deformations around the single particles. EOS Here we assess the validity of this approach and compute the leading term of the effective interaction for large interparticle separation beyond this so-called superposition approximation. EOS As an application, we consider the experimentally relevant case of interface deformations owing to the electrostatic field emanating from charged colloidal particles. EOS In mechanical isolation, i.e., if the net force acting on the total system consisting of the particles plus the interface vanishes, the superposition approximation is actually invalid. EOS The effective capillary interaction is governed by contributions beyond this approximation and turns out to be attractive.	For sufficiently small surface charges on the colloids, such that linearization is strictly valid, and at asymptotically large separations, the effective interaction does not overcome the direct electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal particles.
doc	Small-world networks: Evidence for a crossover picture EOS Watts and Strogatz [Nature 393, 440 (1998)] have recently introduced a model for disordered networks and reported that, even for very small values of the disorder _EQN_ in the links, the network behaves as a small-world. EOS Here, we test the hypothesis that the appearance of small-world behavior is not a phase-transition but a crossover phenomenon which depends both on the network size _EQN_ and on the degree of disorder _EQN_.	We propose that the average distance _EQN_ between any two vertices of the network is a scaling function of _EQN_.

EOS In this paper, we propose to augment a convolutional layer with an additional depthwise convolution, where each input channel is convolved with a different 2D kernel.	The composition of the two convolutions constitutes an over-parameterization, since it adds learnable parameters, while the resulting linear operation can be expressed by a single convolution layer.

doc	Asymmetric Gepner Models III. B-L Lifting EOS In the same spirit as heterotic weight lifting, B-L lifting is a way of replacing the superfluous and ubiquitous U(1)_ B-L with something else with the same modular properties, but different conformal weights and ground state dimensions. EOS This method works in principle for all variants of (2,2) constructions, such as orbifolds, Calabi-Yau manifolds, free bosons and fermions and Gepner models, since it only modifies the universal SO(10) x E_8 part of the CFT. EOS However, it can only yield chiral spectra if the ``internal" sector of the theory provides a simple current of order 5.	Here we apply this new method to Gepner models.

doc	Deterministic Min-Cost Matching with Delays EOS We consider the online Minimum-Cost Perfect Matching with Delays (MPMD) problem introduced by Emek et al (STOC 2016), in which a general metric space is given, and requests are submitted in different times in this space by an adversary. EOS The goal is to match requests, while minimizing the sum of distances between matched pairs in addition to the time intervals passed from the moment each request appeared until it is matched. EOS In the online Minimum-Cost Bipartite Perfect Matching with Delays (MBPMD) problem introduced by Ashlagi et al (APPROX/RANDOM 2017), each request is also associated with one of two classes, and requests can only be matched with requests of the other class. EOS Previous algorithms for the problems mentioned above, include randomized _EQN_ -competitive algorithms for known and finite metric spaces, _EQN_ being the size of the metric space, and a deterministic _EQN_ -competitive algorithm, _EQN_ being the number of requests. EOS We introduce _EQN_ -competitive deterministic algorithms for both problems and for any fixed _EQN_. EOS In particular, for a small enough _EQN_ the competitive ratio becomes _EQN_.	These are the first deterministic algorithms for the mentioned online matching problems, achieving a sub-linear competitive ratio.
doc	Backhaul-Aware Optimization of UAV Base Station Location and Bandwidth Allocation for Profit Maximization EOS Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Base Stations (UAVBSs) are envisioned to be an integral component of the next generation Wireless Communications Networks (WCNs) by dynamically moving the supply towards the demand. EOS A significant drawback of the state-of-the-art have been designing a WCN in which the service-oriented performance measures (e.g., throughput) are optimized without considering different relevant decisions such as determining the location and allocating the resources, jointly.	In this study, we address the UAVBS location and bandwidth allocation problems together to optimize the total network profit.

doc	Polynomial Bottleneck Congestion Games with Optimal Price of Anarchy EOS We study bottleneck congestion games where the social cost is determined by the worst congestion of any resource. EOS These games directly relate to network routing problems and also job-shop scheduling problems. EOS In typical bottleneck congestion games, the utility costs of the players are determined by the worst congested resources that they use. EOS However, the resulting Nash equilibria are inefficient, since the price of anarchy is proportional on the number of resources which can be high. EOS Here we show that we can get smaller price of anarchy with the bottleneck social cost metric. EOS We introduce the polynomial bottleneck games where the utility costs of the players are polynomial functions of the congestion of the resources that they use. EOS In particular, the delay function for any resource _EQN_ is _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the congestion measured as the number of players that use _EQN_, and _EQN_ is an integer constant that defines the degree of the polynomial. EOS The utility cost of a player is the sum of the individual delays of the resources that it uses. EOS The social cost of the game remains the same, namely, it is the worst bottleneck resource congestion: _EQN_. EOS We show that polynomial bottleneck games are very efficient and give price of anarchy _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the set of resources. EOS This price of anarchy is tight, since we demonstrate a game with price of anarchy _EQN_, for any _EQN_.	We obtain our tight bounds by using two proof techniques: transformation, which we use to convert arbitrary games to simpler games, and expansion, which we use to bound the price of anarchy in a simpler game.
doc	Double quantum dot as a probe of nonequilibrium charge fluctuations at the quantum point contact EOS Absorption of energy quanta generated by quantum point contact results in the inelastic current through the double quantum dot placed nearby. EOS In contrast to a single quantum dot, the inelastic current through the double quantum dot is sensitive to the energy dependence of the quantum point contact transmission, which can explain the experimentally observed features.	We calculate the inelastic current as a function of microscopic parameters of the circuit.

EOS This improves on the author's previous results [Algebr.	Geom.
doc	Efficient quantum communication under collective noise EOS We introduce a new quantum communication protocol for the transmission of quantum information under collective noise. EOS Our protocol utilizes a decoherence-free subspace in such a way that an optimal asymptotic transmission rate is achieved, while at the same time encoding and decoding operations can be efficiently implemented. EOS The encoding and decoding circuit requires a number of elementary gates that scale linearly with the number of transmitted qudits, m. EOS The logical depth of our encoding and decoding operations is constant and depends only on the channel in question. EOS For channels described by an arbitrary discrete group G, i.e. EOS with a discrete number, |G|, of possible noise operators, perfect transmission at a rate m/(m+r) is achieved with an overhead that scales at most as _EQN_ where the number of auxiliary qudits, r, depends solely on the group in question. EOS Moreover, this overhead is independent of the number of transmitted qudits, m. EOS For certain groups, e.g.	cyclic groups, we find that the overhead scales only linearly with the number of group elements |G|.
doc	Exclusively produced rho^0 asymmetries on the deuteron and future GPD measurements at COMPASS EOS Generalized parton distributions (GPDs) provide a new and powerful framework for a complete description of the nucleon structure. EOS They can provide a three-dimensional picture of how the quarks and gluons form a nucleon. EOS GPDs can be probed experimentally in hard exclusive meson production or deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS). EOS The COMPASS experiment at CERN is a unique place to study these reactions.	At COMPASS, a high energy polarized positive or negative muon beam is scattered off a polarized or unpolarized fixed target.
doc	On the fair division of a random object EOS Ann likes oranges and dislikes apples; EOS Bob likes apples and dislikes oranges. EOS Tomorrow they will receive one fruit that will be an orange or an apple with equal probability 0.5. EOS Giving to each half of that fruit is fair for each realisation of the fruit; EOS but agreeing that whatever fruit appears will go to the agent who likes it more gives a higher expected utility to each agent and is fair in the average sense: in expectation, each agent prefers his allocation to the equal division of the object, he gets a Fair Share.	We turn this familiar observation into an economic design problem: upon drawing a random object (the fruit), we learn the realised utility of each agent and can compare it to the mean of his distribution of utilities;

Then, the electron energy distribution and the electron yielding rate can be given.
doc	Tile-and-trim micro-resonator array fabrication optimized for high multiplexing factors EOS We present a superconducting micro-resonator array fabrication method that is scalable, reconfigurable, and has been optimized for high multiplexing factors. EOS The method uses uniformly sized tiles patterned on stepper photolithography reticles as the building blocks of an array. EOS We demonstrate this technique on a 101-element microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID) array made from a titanium-nitride superconducting film.	Characterization reveals 1.5\% maximum fractional frequency spacing deviations caused primarily by material parameters that vary smoothly across the wafer.
doc	Discovery of the Eclipsing Detached Double White Dwarf Binary NLTT 11748 EOS We report the discovery of the first eclipsing detached double white dwarf (WD) binary. EOS In a pulsation search, the low-mass helium core WD NLTT 11748 was targeted for fast (approx 1 minute) differential photometry with the Las Cumbres Observatory's Faulkes Telescope North.	Rather than pulsations, we discovered approx 180 s 3%-6% dips in the photometry.

doc	Observations of the Magnetic Cataclysmic Variable VV Puppis with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer EOS We present the first far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations of the magnetic cataclysmic variable VV Puppis, obtained with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer satellite. EOS In addition, we have obtained simultaneous ground-based optical photometric observations of VV Pup during part of the FUV observation. EOS The shapes of the FUV and optical light curves are consistent with each other and with those of past observations at optical, extreme-ultraviolet, and X-ray wavelengths. EOS Time-resolved FUV spectra during the portion of VV Pup's orbit when the accreting magnetic pole of the white dwarf can be seen show an increasing continuum level as the accretion spot becomes more directly visible. EOS The most prominent features in the spectrum are the O VI 1031.9A, 1037.6A emission lines.	We interpret the shape and velocity shift of these lines in the context of an origin in the accretion funnel near the white dwarf surface.
doc	Multiscale Modeling and Coarse Graining of Polymer Dynamics: Simulations Guided by Statistical Beyond-Equilibrium Thermodynamics EOS We review some recent coarse-graining and multi-scale methods, but also put forward some new ideas for addressing such issues.

doc	Higher Order Topological Insulator via Periodic Driving EOS We theoretically investigate a periodically driven semimetal based on a square lattice. EOS The possibility of engineering both Floquet Topological Insulator featuring Floquet edge states and Floquet higher order topological insulating phase, accommodating topological corner modes has been demonstrated starting from the semimetal phase, based on Floquet Hamiltonian picture. EOS Topological phase transition takes place in the bulk quasi-energy spectrum with the variation of the drive amplitude where Chern number changes sign from _EQN_ to _EQN_. EOS This can be attributed to broken time-reversal invariance (_EQN_) due to circularly polarized light.	When the discrete four-fold rotational symmetry (_EQN_) is also broken by adding a Wilson mass term along with broken _EQN_, higher order topological insulator (HOTI), hosting in-gap modes at all the corners, can be realized.
doc	Randomized Algorithms for Computation of Tucker decomposition and Higher Order SVD (HOSVD) EOS Big data analysis has become a crucial part of new emerging technologies such as Internet of thing (IOT), cyber-physical analysis, deep learning, anomaly detection etc. EOS Among many other techniques, dimensionality reduction plays a key role in such analyses and facilitates the procedure of feature selection and feature extraction. EOS Randomized algorithms are efficient tools for handling big data tensors. EOS They accelerate decomposing large-scale data tensors by reducing the computational complexity of deterministic algorithms and also reducing the communication among different levels of memory hierarchy which is a main bottleneck in modern computing environments and architectures. EOS In this paper, we review recent advances in randomization for computation of Tucker decomposition and Higher Order SVD (HOSVD).	We discuss both random projection and sampling approaches and also single-pass and multi-pass randomized algorithms and how they can be utilized in computation of Tucker decomposition and HOSVD.
doc	Orbital order and Hund's rule frustration in Kondo lattices EOS We analyze a microscopic origin of the Kondo effect-assisted orbital order in heavy-fermion materials.

doc	A Parameter-Space Study of Carbon-Oxygen White Dwarf Mergers EOS The merger of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs can lead either to a spectacular transient, stable nuclear burning or a massive, rapidly rotating white dwarf. EOS Simulations of mergers have shown that the outcome strongly depends on whether the white dwarfs are similar or dissimilar in mass. EOS In the similar-mass case, both white dwarfs merge fully and the remnant is hot throughout, while in the dissimilar case, the more massive, denser white dwarf remains cold and essentially intact, with the disrupted lower mass one wrapped around it in a hot envelope and disk. EOS In order to determine what constitutes "similar in mass" and more generally how the properties of the merger remnant depend on the input masses, we simulated unsynchronized carbon-oxygen white dwarf mergers for a large range of masses using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. EOS We find that the structure of the merger remnant varies smoothly as a function of the ratio of the central densities of the two white dwarfs. EOS A density ratio of 0.6 approximately separates similar and dissimilar mass mergers. EOS Confirming previous work, we find that the temperatures of most merger remnants are not high enough to immediately ignite carbon fusion. EOS During subsequent viscous evolution, however, the interior will likely be compressed and heated as the disk accretes and the remnant spins down.	We find from simple estimates that this evolution can lead to ignition for many remnants.
doc	Physics of a clumpy lensed galaxy at z=1.6 EOS Observations have shown that massive star-forming clumps are present in the internal structure of high-redshift galaxies.

doc	Classical Correlation and Quantum Discord in Critical Systems EOS We discuss the behavior of quantum and classical pairwise correlations in critical systems, with the quantumness of the correlations measured by the quantum discord.

Finite-size as well as infinite chains are investigated and the quantum criticality is discussed.
doc	Stochastic Evolution of Augmented Born--Infeld Equations EOS This paper compares the results of applying a recently developed method of stochastic uncertainty quantification designed for fluid dynamics to the Born-Infeld model of nonlinear electromagnetism.

doc	Anomalous decoherence and absence of thermalization in a photonic many-body system EOS The intention of this work is twofold, first to present a most simple system capable of simulating the intrinsic bosonic Josephson effect with photons, and second to study various outcomes deriving from inherent or external decoherence. EOS A qubit induces an effective coupling between two externally pumped cavity modes. EOS Without cavity losses and in the dispersive regime, intrinsic Josephson oscillations of photons between the two modes occurs. EOS In this case, contrary to regular Markovian decoherence, the qubit purity shows a Gaussian decay and recurrence of its coherence. EOS Due to intrinsic non-linearities, both the Josephson oscillations as well as the qubit properties display a rich collapse-revival structure, where, however, the complexity of the qubit evolution is in some sense stronger. EOS The qubit as a meter of the photon dynamics is considered, and it is shown that qubit dephasing, originating for example from non-demolition measurements, results in an exponential destruction of the oscillations which manifests the collectiveness of the Josephson effect. EOS Non-selective qubit measurements, on the other hand, render a Zeno effect seen in a slowing down of the Josephson oscillations.	Contrary to dephasing, cavity dissipation results in a Gaussian decay of the scaled Josephson oscillations.
doc	A radio catalog of Galactic HII regions for applications from decimeter to millimeter wavelengths EOS By collecting the information from 24 previously published lists and catalogs, we produce a comprehensive catalog (Master Catalog) of 1442 Galactic HII regions. EOS For each object, we quote the original fluxes and diameters as well as the available information on radio line velocities, line widths and line temperatures and the errors on these quantitities. EOS References to the original works are also reported. EOS By exploiting all these data we produce a Synthetic Catalog of fluxes and diameters (with corresponding errors) at 2.7 GHz. EOS This choice is motivated by the extensive, although not complete, information available at this frequency, widely spread among many different catalogs, and by its relevance for both detailed studies on Galactic HII regions and the extrapolation up to millimetric wavelengths. EOS The catalog can be used for detailed studies of Galactic HII regions and, by extrapolation, for investigations of HII regions up to millimetric wavelengths.	In particular, we discuss the study of the effects of microwave emission from HII regions on the new generation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments.

EOS Oxygen is found to be overabundant with respect to iron in these stars, with the [O/Fe] ratio increasing from 0.6 to 1 between [Fe/H]=-1.5 and -3.0. EOS The behavior of the oxygen overabundance with respect to [Fe/H] is similar to that seen in previous works based on OI IR triplet data (Abia and Rebolo 1989;	Tomkin et al 1992;
doc	Mass-Loss Evolution of Close-In Exoplanets: Evaporation of Hot Jupiters and the Effect on Population EOS During their evolution, short-period exoplanets may lose envelope mass through atmospheric escape owing to intense XUV (X-ray and extreme ultraviolet) radiation from their host stars. EOS Roche-lobe overflow induced by orbital evolution or intense atmospheric escape can also contribute to mass loss. EOS To study the effects of mass loss on inner planet populations, we calculate the evolution of hot Jupiters considering mass loss of their envelopes and thermal contraction. EOS Mass loss is assumed to occur through XUV-driven atmospheric escape and the following Roche-lobe overflow. EOS The runaway effect of mass loss results in a dichotomy of populations: hot Jupiters that retain their envelopes and super Earths whose envelopes are completely lost.	Evolution primarily depends on the core masses of planets and only slightly on migration history.
doc	The renormalization group equations revisited EOS Starting from a well defined local Lagrangian, we analyze the renormalization group equations in terms of the two different arbitrary scales associated with the regularization procedure and with the physical renormalization of the bare parameters, respectively. EOS We apply our formalism to the minimal subtraction scheme using dimensional regularization.	We first argue that the relevant regularization scale in this case should be dimensionless.
doc	Gluing Constructions Amongst Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces in the (n+1)-Sphere EOS Four constructions of constant mean curvature (CMC) hypersurfaces in the (n+1)-sphere are given, which should be considered analogues of `classical' constructions that are possible for CMC hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. EOS First, Delaunay-like hypersurfaces, consisting roughly of a chain of hyperspheres winding multiple times around an equator, are shown to exist for all values of the mean curvature. EOS Second, a hypersurface is constructed which consists of two chains of spheres winding around a pair of orthogonal equators, showing that Delaunay-like hypersurfaces can be fused together in a symmetric manner. EOS Third, a Delaunay-like handle can be attached to a generalized Clifford torus of the same mean curvature. EOS Finally, two generalized Clifford tori of equal but opposite mean curvature of any magnitude can be attached to each other by symmetrically positioned Delaunay-like `arms'.	This last result extends Butscher and Pacard's doubling construction for generalized Clifford tori of small mean curvature.
doc	Thin Film Growth Effects on Electrical Conductivity in Entropy Stabilized Oxides EOS Entropy stabilization has garnered significant attention as a new approach to designing novel materials. EOS Much of the work in this area has focused on bulk ceramic processing, leaving entropy-stabilized thin films relatively underexplored.	Following an extensive multi-variable investigation of polycrystalline (Mg _EQN_ Co _EQN_ Ni _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ Zn _EQN_)O thin films deposited via pulsed laser deposition (PLD), it is shown here that substrate temperature and deposition pressure have strong and repeatable effects on film texture and lattice parameter.
doc	Intercalant-independent transition temperature in superconducting black phosphorus EOS Research on black phosphorus (BP) has been experiencing a renaissance over the last few years, after the demonstration that few-layer BP exhibits high carrier mobility and a thickness-dependent band gap. EOS For a long time, bulk BP is also known to be a superconductor under high pressure exceeding 10 GPa. EOS The superconductivity is due to a structural transformation into another allotrope of phosphorous and accompanied by a semiconductor-metal transition. EOS No superconductivity could be achieved for BP itself (that is, in its normal orthorhombic form) despite several attempts reported in the literature.	Here we describe successful intercalation of BP by several alkali metals (Li, K, Rb, Cs) and alkali-earth Ca.
doc	Percolation framework reveals limits of privacy in Conspiracy, Dark Web, and Blockchain networks EOS We consider the privacy of interactions between individuals in a network. EOS For many networks, while nodes are anonymous to outside observers, the existence of a link between individuals implies the possibility of one node revealing identifying information about its neighbor. EOS Moreover, while the identities of the accounts are likely hidden to an observer, the network of interaction between two anonymous accounts is often available.	For example, in blockchain cryptocurrencies, transactions between two anonymous accounts are published openly.

doc	Rigorous numerics for critical orbits in the quadratic family EOS We develop algorithms and techniques to compute rigorous bounds for finite pieces of orbits of the critical points, for intervals of parameter values, in the quadratic family of one-dimensional maps _EQN_. EOS We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by constructing a dynamically defined partition _EQN_ of the parameter interval _EQN_ into almost 4 million subintervals, for each of which we compute to high precision the orbits of the critical points up to some time _EQN_ and other dynamically relevant quantities, several of which can vary greatly, possibly spanning several orders of magnitude. EOS We also subdivide _EQN_ into a family _EQN_ of intervals which we call stochastic intervals and a family _EQN_ of intervals which we call regular intervals.	We numerically prove that each interval _EQN_ has an escape time, which roughly means that some iterate of the critical point taken over all the parameters in _EQN_ has considerable width in the phase space.

doc	Spin-current-mediated rapid magnon localisation and coalescence after ultrafast optical pumping of ferrimagnetic alloys EOS Sub-picosecond magnetisation manipulation via femtosecond optical pumping has attracted wide attention ever since its original discovery in 1996. EOS However, the spatial evolution of the magnetisation is not yet well understood, in part due to the difficulty in experimentally probing such rapid dynamics. EOS Here, we find evidence of rapid magnetic order recovery in materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy via nonlinear magnon processes.	We identify both localisation and coalescence regimes, whereby localised magnetic textures nucleate and subsequently evolve in accordance with a power law formalism.

EOS His critics are often known through his numerous controversies wih N. EOS Bohr for a few decades. EOS It has long been suggested that his critics were obsolete and came from an aging man and that it was more a question of philosophy anyway. EOS After J. EOS Bell's contribution however it was claimed that the debate could be closed by an experimental proof, a strange experimental intrusion in philosophy or a strange philosophy. EOS Finally, the experiment being performed, in particular in Orsay with the repeatedly successful experiments of A. EOS Aspect, it was claimed that N. EOS Bohr won. EOS Would the debate be closed? EOS Today and fifty years after his death, it seems that Einstein's critics to quantum mechanics are being regarded differently.	Why is it so?

EOS Our best end-to-end parser, which jointly performs supertagging, POS tagging, and parsing, outperforms the previously reported best results by more than 2.2 LAS and UAS points. EOS The graph-based parsing architecture allows for global inference and rich feature representations for TAG parsing, alleviating the fundamental trade-off between transition-based and graph-based parsing systems.	We also demonstrate that the proposed parser achieves state-of-the-art performance in the downstream tasks of Parsing Evaluation using Textual Entailments (PETE) and Unbounded Dependency Recovery.
doc	Termination of the Phase of Quintessence by Gravitational Back-Reaction EOS We study the effects of gravitational back-reaction in models of Quintessence. EOS The effective energy-momentum tensor with which cosmological fluctuations back-react on the background metric will in some cases lead to a termination of the phase of acceleration. EOS The fluctuations we make use of are the perturbations in our present Universe. EOS Their amplitude is normalized by recent measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background, their slope is taken to be either scale-invariant, or characterized by a slightly blue tilt.	In the latter case, we find that the back-reaction effect of fluctuations whose present wavelength is smaller than the Hubble radius but which are stretched beyond the Hubble radius by the accelerated expansion during the era of Quintessence domination can become large.

EOS Anomalous positive contribution to Hall effect for particular direction of magnetic field H// is found in the single crystals of LuB12 of the highest quality.	This contribution arising at T~ 150 K is shown to increase drastically when approaching the disordered ground state below 60 K.
doc	On squares in Lucas sequences EOS Let P and Q be non-zero integers. EOS The Lucas sequence U_n(P,Q) is defined by U_0=0, U_1=1, U_n= P*U_ n-1 -Q*U_ n-2 for n >1. EOS The question of when U_n(P,Q) can be a perfect square has generated interest in the literature. EOS We show that for n=2,...,7, U_n is a square for infinitely many pairs (P,Q) with gcd(P,Q)=1;	further, for n=8,...,12, the only non-degenerate sequences where gcd(P,Q)=1 and U_n(P,Q)=square, are given by U_8(1,-4)=21^2, U_8(4,-17)=620^2, and U_12(1,-1)=12^2.

It is demonstrated that the plot of the two tidal deformabilities _EQN_ and _EQN_ of the binary neutron star can show up to three separate branches.

doc	DeepSIC: Deep Soft Interference Cancellation for Multiuser MIMO Detection EOS Digital receivers are required to recover the transmitted symbols from their observed channel output. EOS In multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setups, where multiple symbols are simultaneously transmitted, accurate symbol detection is challenging. EOS A family of algorithms capable of reliably recovering multiple symbols is based on interference cancellation. EOS However, these methods assume that the channel is linear, a model which does not reflect many relevant channels, as well as require accurate channel state information (CSI), which may not be available. EOS In this work we propose a multiuser MIMO receiver which learns to jointly detect in a data-driven fashion, without assuming a specific channel model or requiring CSI. EOS In particular, we propose a data-driven implementation of the iterative soft interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm which we refer to as DeepSIC. EOS The resulting symbol detector is based on integrating dedicated machine-learning (ML) methods into the iterative SIC algorithm. EOS DeepSIC learns to carry out joint detection from a limited set of training samples without requiring the channel to be linear and its parameters to be known. EOS Our numerical evaluations demonstrate that for linear channels with full CSI, DeepSIC approaches the performance of iterative SIC, which is comparable to the optimal performance, and outperforms previously proposed ML-based MIMO receivers.	Furthermore, in the presence of CSI uncertainty, DeepSIC significantly outperforms model-based approaches.
doc	Algorithmic and Hardness Results for the Colorful Components Problems EOS In this paper we investigate the colorful components framework, motivated by applications emerging from comparative genomics. EOS The general goal is to remove a collection of edges from an undirected vertex-colored graph _EQN_ such that in the resulting graph _EQN_ all the connected components are colorful (i.e., any two vertices of the same color belong to different connected components). EOS We want _EQN_ to optimize an objective function, the selection of this function being specific to each problem in the framework. EOS We analyze three objective functions, and thus, three different problems, which are believed to be relevant for the biological applications: minimizing the number of singleton vertices, maximizing the number of edges in the transitive closure, and minimizing the number of connected components.	Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm for the first problem.
doc	Phase diagrams for Prisoner's Dilemma game on two-dimensional lattices EOS The effects of payoffs and noise on the maintenance of cooperative behavior are studied in an evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma game with players located on the sites of different two-dimensional lattices. EOS This system exhibits a phase transition from a mixed state of cooperators and defectors to a homogeneous one where only the defectors remain alive. EOS Using systematic Monte Carlo simulations and different levels of the generalized mean-field approximations we have determined the phase boundaries (critical points) separating the two phases on the plane of the temperature (noise) and temptation to choose defection.	In the zero temperature limit this analysis suggests that the cooperation can be sustained only for those connectivity structures where three-site clique percolation occurs.
doc	A model of magnetic friction with the infinite-range interaction EOS We investigate a model of magnetic friction with the infinite-range interaction by mean field analysis and a numerical simulation, and compare its behavior with that of the short-range model which we considered previously [H.Komatsu, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS E. EOS 100, 052130 (2019)].	This infinite-range model always obeys the Stokes law when the temperature is higher than the critical value, _EQN_, whereas it shows a crossover or transition from the Dieterich--Ruina law to the Stokes law when the temperature is lower than _EQN_.
doc	The Three-Dimensional Structure of the M31 Satellite System; Strong Evidence for an Inhomogeneous Distribution of Satellites EOS We undertake an investigation into the spatial structure of the M31 satellite system utilizing the distance distributions presented in a previous publication. EOS These distances make use of the unique combination of depth and spatial coverage of the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) to provide a large, homogeneous sample consisting of 27 of M31's satellites, as well as M31 itself. EOS We find that the satellite distribution, when viewed as a whole, is no more planar than one would expect from a random distribution of equal size. EOS A disk consisting of 15 of the satellites is however found to be highly significant, and strikingly thin, with a root-mean-square thickness of just _EQN_ kpc.	This disk is oriented approximately edge on with respect to the Milky Way and almost perpendicular to the Milky Way disk.
doc	Piecewise smooth systems near a co-dimension 2 discontinuity manifold: can one say what should happen? EOS We consider a piecewise smooth system in the neighborhood of a co-dimension 2 discontinuity manifold _EQN_. EOS Within the class of Filippov solutions, if _EQN_ is attractive, one should expect solution trajectories to slide on _EQN_. EOS It is well known, however, that the classical Filippov convexification methodology is ambiguous on _EQN_. EOS The situation is further complicated by the possibility that, regardless of how sliding on _EQN_ is taking place, during sliding motion a trajectory encounters so-called generic first order exit points, where _EQN_ ceases to be attractive.	In this work, we attempt to understand what behavior one should expect of a solution trajectory near _EQN_ when _EQN_ is attractive, what to expect when _EQN_ ceases to be attractive (at least, at generic exit points), and finally we also contrast and compare the behavior of some regularizations proposed in the literature.
doc	Turbulent pitch-angle scattering and diffusive transport of hard-X-ray producing electrons in flaring coronal loops EOS Recent observations from RHESSI have revealed that the number of non-thermal electrons in the coronal part of a flaring loop can exceed the number of electrons required to explain the hard X-ray-emitting footpoints of the same flaring loop. EOS Such sources cannot, therefore, be interpreted on the basis of the standard collisional transport model, in which electrons stream along the loop while losing their energy through collisions with the ambient plasma;	additional physical processes, to either trap or scatter the energetic electrons, are required.
doc	Modeling noise induced resonance in an excitable system: An alternative approach EOS Recently, it is observed [Md. EOS Nurujjaman et al, Phy. EOS Rev. EOS E \textbf 80, 015201 (R) (2009)] that in an excitable system, one can maintain noise induced coherency in the coherence resonance by blocking the destructive effect of the noise on the system at higher noise level. EOS This phenomenon of constant coherence resonance (CCR) cannot be explained by the existing way of simulation of the model equations of an excitable system with added noise.	In this paper, we have proposed a general model which explains the noise induced resonance phenomenon CCR as well as coherence resonance (CR) and stochastic resonance (SR).

doc	Continuum Theory of Tkachenko Modes in Rotating Bose-Einstein Condensate EOS The present paper suggests the continuum theory of Tkachenko modes in a rotating 2D Bose-Einstein condensate taking into account density inhomogeneity and compressibility of the condensate. EOS The problem requires solution of coupled hydrodynamic equations for vortex and liquid motion with proper boundary conditions, which were derived for the condensate described by the Thomas-Fermi approximation. EOS Compressibility becomes essential at rapid rotation with angular velocity close to the trap frequency.	The theory is in a reasonable agreement with experimental observation of Tkachenko modes.
doc	Transverse oscillations of systems of coronal loops EOS We study the collective kinklike normal modes of a system of several cylindrical loops using the T-matrix theory. EOS Loops that have similar kink frequencies oscillate collectively with a frequency which is slightly different from that of the individual kink mode. EOS On the other hand, if the kink frequency of a loop is different from that of the others, it oscillates individually with its own frequency. EOS Since the individual kink frequency depends on the loop density but not on its radius for typical 1 MK coronal loops, a coupling between kink oscillations of neighboring loops take place when they have similar densities. EOS The relevance of these results in the interpretation of the oscillations studied by REF schrijver2000 and REF verwichte2004, in which transverse collective loop oscillations seem to be detected, is discussed.	In the first case, two loops oscillating in antiphase are observed;

EOS The integrability of such systems has been proven by M.	Field and J.

In this paper we present a new floating gate transistor (FGT) design based on multilayer graphene nanoribbon (MLGNR) and carbon nanotube (CNT).
doc	On the Evolution of Quasicrystalline and Crystalline Phases in Rapidly Quenched Al-Co-Cu-Ni Alloy EOS The occurrence of stable decagonal quasicrystalline phase in Al-Co-Ni and Al-Cu-Co alloys through conventional solidification is well established. EOS Earlier, we have studied the effect of Cu substitution in place of Co in the Al70 Co15Ni15 alloy. EOS Here we report the structural/micro-structural changes with substitution of Cu for Ni in rapidly solidified Al-Co-Ni alloys. EOS The melt-spun ribbons have been characterized using X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM & TEM). EOS With an increase in Cu content in the melt spun Al70 Co15Cux Ni15-x (x=0 to 15) alloys, the relative amount of the decagonal phase decreased up to 10 at% of Cu. EOS At this composition the quaternary alloy showed the coexistence of decagonal quasicrystal and superstructure of tau 3 vacancy ordered crystalline phases.	The decagonal phase containing Cu showed more disordering compared to Al-Co-Ni alloys.

Criminals are in the constant state of attempting cybersecurity defense of various infrastructures and businesses.
doc	Working Principles of Binary Differential Evolution EOS We conduct a first fundamental analysis of the working principles of binary differential evolution (BDE), an optimization heuristic for binary decision variables that was derived by Gong and Tuson (2007) from the very successful classic differential evolution (DE) for continuous optimization. EOS We show that unlike most other optimization paradigms, it is stable in the sense that neutral bit values are sampled with probability close to _EQN_ for a long time. EOS This is generally a desirable property, however, it makes it harder to find the optima for decision variables with small influence on the objective function.	This can result in an optimization time exponential in the dimension when optimizing simple symmetric functions like OneMax.

doc	Order statistics from overlapping samples: bivariate densities and regression properties EOS In this paper we are interested in the joint distribution of two order statistics from overlapping samples. EOS We give an explicit formula for the distribution of such a pair of random variables under the assumption that the parent distribution is absolutely continuous (with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the real line). EOS The distribution is identified through the form of the density with respect to a measure which is a sum of the bivariate Lebesgue measure on _EQN_ and the univariate Lebesgue measure on the diagonal _EQN_. EOS We are also interested in the question to what extent conditional expectation of one of such order statistic given another determines the parent distribution. EOS In particular, we provide a new characterization by linearity of regression of an order statistic from the extended sample given the one from the original sample, special case of which solves a problem explicitly stated in the literature.	It appears that to describe the correct parent distribution it is convenient to use quantile density functions.
doc	Derivation of the Dirac Equation from Principles of Information Processing EOS We show how the Dirac equation in three space-dimensions emerges from the large-scale dynamics of the minimal nontrivial quantum cellular automaton satisfying unitariety, locality, homogeneity, and discrete isotropy, without using the relativity principle. EOS The Dirac equation is recovered for small wave-vector and inertial mass, whereas Lorentz covariance is distorted in the ultra-relativistic limit. EOS The automaton can thus be regarded as a theory unifying scales from Planck to Fermi.	A simple asymptotic approach leads to a dispersive Schroedinger equation describing the evolution of narrow-band states at all scales.

doc	Scalar-tensor gravity in the Palatini approach EOS The main objective of this thesis is to discuss scalar-tensor theories in the Palatini approach. EOS Both scalar-tensor theories and Palatini formalism are means of alternating classical theory of gravity, general relativity, in order to account for phenomena being seemingly unexplainable on the ground of the Einstein theory or to serve as toy models used to test limitations of the theory in question. EOS In the literature, both Palatini approach and scalar-tensor theories have been widely discussed, but there are very few - if none - authors writing about a merge of these two ideas. EOS The present paper is a result of an insufficient attention given to the topic of scalar-tensor theories in Palatini formalism. EOS In the course of the thesis action functional for scalar-tensor theories of gravity will be introduced. EOS This action functional differs significantly from the action defined in case of scalar-tensor theories in metric approach. EOS We aim at analysing the theory using the language of invariants, allowing us to write down all equations in a frame-independent manner. EOS We discover that invariants defined for the metric case do not always have their counterparts in Palatini formalism. EOS Also, two frames most frequently used in the literature are discussed: Einstein and Jordan frame.	Possible applications of the theory developed in the first part of the thesis are presented.
doc	The Mad Hatter&acute;s Cocktail Party: A Social Mobile Audio Space Supporting Multiple Simultaneous Conversations EOS This paper presents a mobile audio space intended for use by gelled social groups. EOS In face-to-face interactions in such social groups, conversational floors change frequently, e.g., two participants split off to form a new conversational floor, a participant moves from one conversational floor to another, etc. EOS To date, audio spaces have provided little support for such dynamic regroupings of participants, either requiring that the participants explicitly specify with whom they wish to talk or simply presenting all participants as though they are in a single floor. EOS By contrast, the audio space described here monitors participant behavior to identify conversational floors as they emerge. EOS The system dynamically modifies the audio delivered to each participant to enhance the salience of the participants with whom they are currently conversing.	We report a user study of the system, focusing on conversation analytic results.

doc	Active Gel Model of Amoeboid Cell Motility EOS We develop a model of amoeboid cell motility based on active gel theory. EOS Modeling the motile apparatus of a eukaryotic cell as a confined layer of finite length of poroelastic active gel permeated by a solvent, we first show that, due to active stress and gel turnover, an initially static and homogeneous layer can undergo a contractile-type instability to a polarized moving state in which the rear is enriched in gel polymer. EOS This agrees qualitatively with motile cells containing an actomyosin-rich uropod at their rear.	We find that the gel layer settles into a steadily moving, inhomogeneous state at long times, sustained by a balance between contractility and filament turnover.
doc	A branch-and-price approach with MILP formulation to modularity density maximization on graphs EOS For clustering of an undirected graph, this paper presents an exact algorithm for the maximization of modularity density, a more complicated criterion to overcome drawbacks of the well-known modularity. EOS The problem can be interpreted as the set-partitioning problem, which reminds us of its integer linear programming (ILP) formulation. EOS We provide a branch-and-price framework for solving this ILP, or column generation combined with branch-and-bound. EOS Above all, we formulate the column generation subproblem to be solved repeatedly as a simpler mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. EOS Acceleration techniques called the set-packing relaxation and the multiple-cutting-planes-at-a-time combined with the MILP formulation enable us to optimize the modularity density for famous test instances including ones with over 100 vertices in around four minutes by a PC.	Our solution method is deterministic and the computation time is not affected by any stochastic behavior.
doc	An Optimal Control Problem for the Steady Nonhomogeneous Asymmetric Fluids EOS We study an optimal boundary control problem for the two-dimensional stationary micropolar fluids system with variable density. EOS We control the system by considering boundary controls, for the velocity vector and angular velocity of rotation of particles, on parts of the boundary of the flow domain. EOS On the remaining part of the boundary, we consider mixed boundary conditions for the vector velocity (Dirichlet and Navier conditions) and Dirichlet boundary conditions for the angular velocity. EOS We analyze the existence of a weak solution obtaining the fluid density as a scalar function of the stream function.	We prove the existence of an optimal solution and, by using the Lagrange multipliers theorem, we state first-order optimality conditions.
doc	The Spectral Problem for the q-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equation and Continuous q-Jacobi Polynomials EOS The spectral problem for the q-Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for _EQN_ at arbitrary level _EQN_ is considered. EOS The case of two-point functions in the fundamental representation is studied in detail.The scattering states are given explicitly in terms of continuous q-Jacobi polynomials, and the _EQN_ -matrix is derived from their asymptotic behavior. EOS The level zero _EQN_ -matrix is shown to coincide, up to a trivial factor, with the kink-antikink _EQN_ -matrix for the spin- _EQN_ XXZ antiferromagnet.	In the limit of infinite level we observe connections with harmonic analysis on _EQN_ -adic groups with the prime _EQN_ given by _EQN_.
doc	Adaptive Fuzzy Control for Fractional-Order Interconnected Systems with Unknown Control Directions EOS This paper concentrates on the study of the decentralized fuzzy control method for a class of fractional-order interconnected systems with unknown control directions. EOS To overcome the difficulties caused by the multiple unknown control directions in fractional-order systems, a novel fractional-order Nussbaum function technique is proposed. EOS This technique is much more general than those of existing works since it not only handles single/multiple unknown control directions but is also suitable for fractional/integer-order single/interconnected systems. EOS Based on this technique, a new decentralized adaptive control method is proposed for fractional-order interconnected systems.	Smooth functions are introduced to compensate for unknown interactions among subsystems adaptively.
doc	Magnetic Response of Magnetospirillum Gryphiswaldense EOS In this study we modelled and measured the U-turn trajectories of individual magnetotactic bacteria under the application of rotating magnetic fields, ranging in ampitude from 1 to 12 mT. EOS The model is based on the balance between rotational drag and magnetic torque. EOS For accurate verification of this model, bacteria were observed inside 5 m tall microfluidic channels, so that they remained in focus during the entire trajectory.	From the analysis of hundreds of trajectories and accurate measurements of bacteria and magnetosome chain dimensions, we confirmed that the model is correct within measurement error.

doc	Band offsets and density of Ti3+ states probed by X-ray photoemission on LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterointerfaces and their LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 bulk precursors EOS A set of LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO-STO) interfaces has been probed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy in order to contrast and compare the effects of LAO overlayer thickness and of the growth conditions on the electronic properties of these heterostructures. EOS These effects are tracked by considering the band-offset and the density of Ti3+ states, respectively. EOS It is shown that the dominant effects on the local electronic properties are determined by the O2 partial pressure during the growth. EOS In particular, a low P(O2) yields Ti3+ states with higher density and lower binding energy as compared to the sample grown at high P(O2) or to the bare STO reference sample.	Band offset effects are all below about 0.7 eV, but a careful analysis of Ti 2p and Sr 3d peaks shows that valence band offsets can be at the origin of the observed peak width.
doc	Simulating young star clusters with primordial binaries EOS We simulate a cluster of 144179 stars including 13107 primordial hard binaries (10% of the total number of single stars and binary centers of mass), using direct integration of the equations of motion of all stars and binaries and incorporating the effects of stellar and binary evolution. EOS The initial conditions are representative of young dense star clusters in the Local Group and other nearby galaxies like the Antennae and M82. EOS We find that the early phase of core collapse, driven by mass segregation, is not appreciably delayed by the presence of a large number of hard binaries. EOS By the end of the simulation, at an age of 115Myr, the cluster radius has expanded by about a factor of two. EOS This may be explained as adiabatic expansion driven by the loss (via stellar evolution) of about 40% of the initial total mass. EOS Binary dynamics apparently has little effect on the early cluster expansion. EOS During the evolution, the total binary fraction drops at a roughly constant rate of about 0.01% per Myr. EOS The fraction of very hard binaries, however increases at about 0.025% per Myr.	By the end of the simulation the cluster contains 37 binaries containing at least one black hole;

EOS We design a domain-specific language (DSL) that allows for arbitrary concatenations of API outputs and constant strings. EOS The DSL consists of three family of APIs: regular expression-based APIs, lookup APIs, and transformation APIs. EOS We then present a novel neural synthesis algorithm to search for programs in the DSL that are consistent with a given set of examples. EOS The search algorithm uses recently introduced neural architectures to encode input-output examples and to model the program search in the DSL.	We show that synthesis algorithm outperforms baseline methods for synthesizing programs on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.
doc	Correlation energies for many-electron atoms with explicitly correlated Slater functions EOS In this work we propose a novel composite method for accurate calculation of the energies of many-electron atoms. EOS The dominant contribution to the energy (pair energies) are calculated by using explicitly correlated factorisable coupled cluster theory. EOS Instead of the usual Gaussian-type geminals for the expansion of the pair functions, we employ two-electron Hylleraas basis set. EOS This eliminates the need for massive optimisation of nonlinear parameters and the required three-electron integrals can now be calculated relatively easily. EOS The remaining contributions to the energy are calculated within the algebraic approximation by using large one-electron basis sets composed of Slater-type orbitals. EOS The method is tested for the beryllium atom where the accuracy better than _EQN_ cm _EQN_ is obtained.	We discuss in details possible sources of the error and estimate the uncertainty in each energy component.
doc	TRPC4 ion channel protein is selectively expressed in a subpopulation of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area EOS The nonselective cation channel TRPC4 has been shown to be present in high abundance in the corticolimbic regions of the brain and play a pivotal role in modulating cellular excitability due to their involvement in intracellular Ca2+ regulation. EOS Recently we reported their involvement in socialization and regulating anxiety-like behaviors in rats. EOS Given the important role for dopamine in modulating emotions involved in social anxiety we investigated whether TRPC4 protein and mRNA was found on dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA).	Using emulsion autoradiography we found that TRPC4 mRNA is indeed present in the VTA and the substantia nigra.
doc	Robustness of Magic and Symmetries of the Stabiliser Polytope EOS We give a new algorithm for computing the robustness of magic - a measure of the utility of quantum states as a computational resource. EOS Our work is motivated by the magic state model of fault-tolerant quantum computation. EOS In this model, all unitaries belong to the Clifford group. EOS Non-Clifford operations are effected by injecting non-stabiliser states, which are referred to as magic states in this context. EOS The robustness of magic measures the complexity of simulating such a circuit using a classical Monte Carlo algorithm.	It is closely related to the degree negativity that slows down Monte Carlo simulations through the infamous sign problem.

doc	Scheduling for a Processor Sharing System with Linear Slowdown EOS We consider the problem of scheduling arrivals to a congestion system with a finite number of users having identical deterministic demand sizes. EOS The congestion is of the processor sharing type in the sense that all users in the system at any given time are served simultaneously. EOS However, in contrast to classical processor sharing congestion models, the processing slowdown is proportional to the number of users in the system at any time. EOS That is, the rate of service experienced by all users is linearly decreasing with the number of users. EOS For each user there is an ideal departure time (due date). EOS A centralized scheduling goal is then to select arrival times so as to minimize the total penalty due to deviations from ideal times weighted with sojourn times. EOS Each deviation is assumed quadratic, or more generally convex. EOS But due to the dynamics of the system, the scheduling objective function is non-convex. EOS Specifically, the system objective function is a non-smooth piecewise convex function.	Nevertheless, we are able to leverage the structure of the problem to derive an algorithm that finds the global optimum in a (large but) finite number of steps, each involving the solution of a constrained convex program.

EOS Both scalar and tensor fluctuations generated during this early accelerated expansion contain crucial information about the particle content of the primordial universe. EOS The advent of ground- and space-based interferometers enables us to probe primordial physics at length-scales much smaller than those corresponding to current CMB constraints. EOS One key prediction of single-field slow-roll inflation is a red-tilted gravitational wave spectrum, currently inaccessible at interferometer scales.	Interferometers probe directly inflationary physics that deviates from the minimal scenario and in particular additional particle content with sizeable couplings to the inflaton field.

doc	The HIPASS Catalogue - II. Completeness, Reliability, and Parameter Accuracy EOS The HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) is a blind extragalactic HI 21-cm emission line survey covering the whole southern sky from declination -90 to +25. EOS The HIPASS catalogue (HICAT), containing 4315 HI-selected galaxies from the region south of declination +2, is presented in Meyer et al (2004a, Paper I). EOS This paper describes in detail the completeness and reliability of HICAT, which are calculated from the recovery rate of synthetic sources and follow-up observations, respectively.	HICAT is found to be 99 per cent complete at a peak flux of 84 mJy and an integrated flux of 9.4 Jy km/s.

doc	On the possibility of detecting extrasolar planets' atmospheres with the Rossiter-McLaughlin-effect EOS The detection of extrasolar planets' atmospheres requires very demanding observations. EOS For planets that can not be spatially separated from their host stars, i.e. EOS the vast majority of planets, the transiting planets are the only ones allowing to probe their atmospheres. EOS This is possible from transmission spectroscopy or from measurements taken during secondary eclipse. EOS An alternative is the measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin-effect, which is sensitive to the size of the planetary radius. EOS Since the radius is wavelength-dependent due to contributions of strong planetary absorption lines, this opens a path to probe planetary atmospheres also with ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy. EOS The major goal of our numerical simulations is to provide a reliable estimate of the amplitude of the wavelength-dependent RM-effect. EOS Our numerical simulations provide phase resolved synthetic spectra modeling the partly eclipsed stellar surface during the transit in detail. EOS Using these spectra we can obtain RM-curves for different wavelength regions and for a wavelength-dependent planetary radius. EOS Curves from regions with high and low contributions of absorption lines within the planetary atmosphere can be compared. EOS From these differential effects observable quantities are derived. EOS We applied our simulations to HD209458. EOS Our numerical simulations show that a detailed treatment of the limb darkening for the synthetic spectra is important for a precise analysis. EOS Compared to a parameterized limb darkening law, systematic errors of 6 m/sec occur.	The wavelength dependency of the planetary atmospheres over the NaD-doublet produce a differential effect in the RM-curve of 1.5 m/sec for a star with a rotation velocity of 4.5 km/sec which increases to 4 m/sec for twice the rotation velocity.

doc	Numerical construction of multipartite entanglement witnesses EOS Entanglement in multipartite systems is a key resource for quantum information and communication protocols, making its verification in complex systems a necessity. EOS Because an exact calculation of arbitrary entanglement probes is impossible, we derive and implement a numerical method to construct multipartite witnesses to uncover entanglement in arbitrary systems. EOS Our technique is based on a substantial generalization of the power iteration, an essential tool for computing eigenvalues, and it is a solver for the separability eigenvalue equations, enabling the general formulation of optimal entanglement witnesses. EOS Beyond our rigorous derivation and direct implementation of this method, we also apply our approach to several examples of complexly quantum-correlated states and benchmark its general performance.	Consequently, we provide an generally applicable numerical tool for the identification of multipartite entanglement.
doc	Cosmic censorship in overcharging a Reissner-Nordstr\" o m black hole via charged particle absorption EOS There is a claim that a static charged black hole (Reissner-Nordstr\" o m black hole) can be overcharged by absorbing a charged test particle. EOS If it is true, it might give a counter example to the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, which states that spacetime singularities are never observed by a distant observer. EOS However, so far the proposed process has only been analyzed within a test particle approximation. EOS Here we claim that the back reaction effects of a charged particle cannot be neglected when judging whether the suggested process is really a counter example to the cosmic censorship conjecture or not.	Furthermore, we argue that all the back reaction effects can be properly taken into account when we consider the trajectory of a particle on the border between the plunge and bounce orbits.

doc	Retardation of Bulk Water Dynamics by Disaccharide Osmolytes EOS The bioprotective nature of disaccharides is hypothesized to derive from the modification of the hydrogen bonding network of water which protects biomolecules through lowered water activity at the protein interface. EOS Using ultrafast fluorescence spectroscopy we measured the relaxation of bulk water dynamics around the induced dipole moment of two fluorescent probes (Lucifer Yellow Ethylenediamine and Tryptophan). EOS Our results indicate a reduction in bulk water reorganization rate of approximately of 30%.	We observe this retardation in the low concentration regime measured at 0.1M and 0.25 M, far below the onset of glassy dynamics.
doc	The effect of cooling on particle trajectories and acceleration in relativistic magnetic reconnection EOS The maximum synchrotron burnoff limit of 160 MeV represents a fundamental limit to radiation resulting from electromagnetic particle acceleration in one-zone ideal plasmas.	In magnetic reconnection, however, particle acceleration and radiation are decoupled because the electric field is larger than the magnetic field in the diffusion region.
doc	To Feed or Not to Feed Back EOS We study the communication over Finite State Channels (FSCs), where the encoder and the decoder can control the availability or the quality of the noise-free feedback. EOS Specifically, the instantaneous feedback is a function of an action taken by the encoder, an action taken by the decoder, and the channel output. EOS Encoder and decoder actions take values in finite alphabets, and may be subject to average cost constraints. EOS We prove capacity results for such a setting by constructing a sequence of achievable rates, using a simple scheme based on 'code tree' generation, that generates channel input symbols along with encoder and decoder actions.	We prove that the limit of this sequence exists.
doc	Estimating the phase in ground-based interferometry: performance comparison between single-mode and multimode schemes EOS In this paper we compare the performance of multi and single-mode interferometry for the estimation of the phase of the complex visibility. EOS We provide a theoretical description of the interferometric signal which enables to derive the phase error in presence of detector, photon and atmospheric noises, for both multi and single-mode cases. EOS We show that, despite the loss of flux occurring when injecting the light in the single-mode component (i.e. EOS single-mode fibers, integrated optics), the spatial filtering properties of such single-mode devices often enable higher performance than multimode concepts. EOS In the high flux regime speckle noise dominated, single-mode interferometry is always more efficient, and its performance is significantly better when the correction provided by adaptive optics becomes poor, by a factor of 2 and more when the Strehl ratio is lower than 10%.	In low light level cases (detector noise regime), multimode interferometry reaches better performance, yet the gain never exceeds 20%, which corresponds to the percentage of photon loss due to the injection in the guides.

doc	Finite temperature Dicke phase transition of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical cavity EOS Dicke model predicts a quantum phase transition from normal to superradiant phases for a two-level atomic ensemble coupled with an optical cavity at zero temperature. EOS In a recent pioneer experiment [Nature 464, 1301 (2010)], such a phase transition has been observed using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in an optical cavity. EOS Compared with the original Dicke model, the experimental system features finite temperature and strong atom-photon nonlinear interaction in BEC.	In this Letter, we develop a finite temperature theory for the Dicke phase transition of a BEC in an optical cavity, taking into account the atom-photon nonlinear interaction.
doc	Gravitational waves from p-form inflation EOS Recently it was shown that an inflationary background can be realized by any _EQN_ -form field non-minimally coupled to gravity. EOS In this paper, we study gravitational waves generated during p-form inflation. EOS Even though the background evolution is identical to that in conventional scalar field inflation, the behavior of gravitational waves is different in p-form inflation.	In particular, we find that the propagation speed of gravitational waves differs from unity in 2- and 3-form inflationary models.
doc	Spin systems dynamics and faults detection in threshold networks EOS We consider an agent on a fixed but arbitrary node of a known threshold network, with the task of detecting an unknown missing link/node. EOS We obtain analytic formulas for the probability of success, when the agent's tool is the free evolution of a single excitation on an XX spin system paired with the network. EOS We completely characterize the parameters allowing for an advantageous solution. EOS From the results emerges an optimal (deterministic) algorithm for quantum search, therefore gaining a quadratic speed-up with respect to the optimal classical analogue, and in line with well-known results in quantum computation.	When attempting to detect a faulty node, the chosen setting appears to be very fragile and the probability of success too small to be of any direct use.
doc	Concurrent Decentralized Channel Allocation and Access Point Selection using Multi-Armed Bandits in multi BSS WLANs EOS Enterprise Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) consist of multiple Access Points (APs) covering a given area.

Recently, in wireless networking, the use of reinforcement learning techniques has emerged as an effective solution to efficiently explore the impact of different network configurations in the system performance, identifying those that provide better performance.
doc	High-Dimensional Uncertainty Quantification of Electronic and Photonic IC with Non-Gaussian Correlated Process Variations EOS Uncertainty quantification based on generalized polynomial chaos has been used in many applications. EOS It has also achieved great success in variation-aware design automation. EOS However, almost all existing techniques assume that the parameters are mutually independent or Gaussian correlated, which is rarely true in real applications. EOS For instance, in chip manufacturing, many process variations are actually correlated. EOS Recently, some techniques have been developed to handle non-Gaussian correlated random parameters, but they are time-consuming for high-dimensional problems. EOS We present a new framework to solve uncertainty quantification problems with many non-Gaussian correlated uncertainties. EOS Firstly, we propose a set of smooth basis functions to well capture the impact of non-Gaussian correlated process variations. EOS We develop a tensor approach to compute these basis functions in a high-dimension setting. EOS Secondly, we investigate the theoretical aspect and practical implementation of a sparse solver to compute the coefficients of all basis functions. EOS We provide some theoretical analysis for the exact recovery condition and error bound of this sparse solver in the context of uncertainty quantification. EOS We present three adaptive sampling approaches to improve the performance of the sparse solver. EOS Finally, we validate our methods by synthetic and practical electronic/photonic ICs with 19 to 57 non-Gaussian correlated variation parameters. EOS Our approach outperforms Monte Carlo by thousands of times in terms of efficiency.	It can also accurately predict the output density functions with multiple peaks caused by non-Gaussian correlations, which are hard to capture by existing methods.
doc	The route to chaos in routing games: When is Price of Anarchy too optimistic? EOS Routing games are amongst the most studied classes of games. EOS Their two most well-known properties are that learning dynamics converge to equilibria and that all equilibria are approximately optimal. EOS In this work, we perform a stress test for these classic results by studying the ubiquitous dynamics, Multiplicative Weights Update, in different classes of congestion games, uncovering intricate non-equilibrium phenomena. EOS As the system demand increases, the learning dynamics go through period-doubling bifurcations, leading to instabilities, chaos and large inefficiencies even in the simplest case of non-atomic routing games with two paths of linear cost where the Price of Anarchy is equal to one. EOS Starting with this simple class, we show that every system has a carrying capacity, above which it becomes unstable. EOS If the equilibrium flow is a symmetric _EQN_ split, the system exhibits one period-doubling bifurcation. EOS A single periodic attractor of period two replaces the attracting fixed point. EOS Although the Price of Anarchy is equal to one, in the large population limit the time-average social cost for all but a zero measure set of initial conditions converges to its worst possible value.	For asymmetric equilibrium flows, increasing the demand eventually forces the system into Li-Yorke chaos with positive topological entropy and periodic orbits of all possible periods.
doc	A 12.5 GHz-Spaced Optical Frequency Comb Spanning >400 nm for near-Infrared Astronomical Spectrograph Calibration EOS A 12.5 GHz-spaced optical frequency comb locked to a Global Positioning disciplined oscillator for near-IR spectrograph calibration is presented. EOS The comb is generated via filtering a 250 MHz-spaced comb. EOS Subsequency nonlinear broadening of the 12.5 GHz comb extends the wavelength range to cover 1380 nm to 1820 nm, providing complete coverage over the H-band transmission widow of Earth's atmosphere. EOS Finite suppression of spurious sidemodes, optical linewidth and instability of the comb have been examined to estmiate potential wavelength biases in spectrograph calibration. EOS Sidemode suppression varies between 20 db and 45 dB, and the optical linewidth is ~350 kHz at 1550 nm.	The comb frequency uncertainty is bounded by +/- 30 kHz (corresponding to a radial velocity of +/- 5 cm/s), limited by the Global Positioning System disciplined oscillator reference.

doc	Selective reflection from a Potassium atomic layer with a thickness as small as _EQN_ EOS We demonstrate that a method using the derivative of the selective reflection signal from a nanocell is a convenient and robust tool for atomic laser spectroscopy, achieving a nearly Doppler-free spectral resolution. EOS The recorded linewidth of the signal from a potassium-filled cell, whose thickness _EQN_ lies in the range _EQN_ nm, is 18 times smaller than the Doppler linewidth (_EQN_ MHz full width at half maximum) of potassium atoms. EOS We also show experimentally a sign oscillation of the reflected signal's derivative with a periodicity of _EQN_ when _EQN_ varies from 190 to 1200~nm confirming the theoretical prediction.	We report the first measurement of the van der Waals atom-surface interaction coefficient _EQN_ kHz _EQN_ m _EQN_ of potassium _EQN_ transitions with the nanocell's sapphire windows, demonstrating the usefulness and convenience of the derivative of selective reflection technique for cell thicknesses in the range _EQN_ nm.

doc	Ionized Nitrogen Mono-hydride Bands are Identified in the Pre-solar and Carbonado Diamond Spectra EOS None of the well established Nitrogen related IR absorption bands, common in synthetic and terrestrial diamonds, have been identified in the pre-solar diamond spectra. EOS In the carbonado diamond spectra only the single nitrogen impurity (C centre) is identified and the assignments of the rest of the nitrogen-related bands are still debated. EOS It is speculated that the unidentified bands in the Nitrogen absorption region are not induced by Nitrogen but rather by Nitrogen-hydrides because in the interstellar environment Nitrogen reacts with Hydrogen and forms NH+; EOS NH; EOS NH2; EOS NH3. EOS Among these Hydrides the electronic configuration of NH+ is the closest to Carbon. EOS Thus this ionized Nitrogen-mono-hydride is the best candidate to substitute Carbon in the diamond structure.	The bands of the substitutional NH+ defect are deduced by red shifting the irradiation induced N+ bands due to the mass of the additional Hydrogen.

EOS Galactic disks are built-up inside-out by gas infall with accretion rates driven by the cosmological mass aggregation history (MAH).	We generate the MAHs for a Gaussian density fluctuation field, and we calculate the gravitational collapse and virialization of the dark halos.

EOS We have constructed an X-ray catalog consisting of the largest sample of clusters in the redshift range for which pointed X-ray observations were carried out with both the observatories. EOS We determined the emission-weighted X-ray temperatures of the clusters with ASCA, while we studied surface brightness distribution with the ROSAT HRI utilizing the isothermal beta model.	We investigated the statistical properties and trends for redshift evolution of the X-ray parameters including the temperature, the density profile of the intracluster gas and the gas-mass fraction within r500.

EOS A key challenge in this area lies in the design of trajectories which, while allowing the completion of the UAV mission, can guarantee reliable cellular connectivity all along the path. EOS Previous approaches in this domain have considered simplistic propagation model assumptions (e.g. EOS Line of Sight based) or more advanced models but with computationally demanding optimized solutions.	In this paper, we propose a novel approach for trajectory design using a coverage map that can be obtained with a combination of 3D map of the environment and radio propagation models.

doc	Transforming acoustic characteristics to deceive playback spoofing countermeasures of speaker verification systems EOS Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems use a playback detector to filter out playback attacks and ensure verification reliability. EOS Since current playback detection models are almost always trained using genuine and played-back speech, it may be possible to degrade their performance by transforming the acoustic characteristics of the played-back speech close to that of the genuine speech. EOS One way to do this is to enhance speech "stolen" from the target speaker before playback. EOS We tested the effectiveness of a playback attack using this method by using the speech enhancement generative adversarial network to transform acoustic characteristics. EOS Experimental results showed that use of this "enhanced stolen speech" method significantly increases the equal error rates for the baseline used in the ASVspoof 2017 challenge and for a light convolutional neural network-based method.	The results also showed that its use degrades the performance of a Gaussian mixture model-universal background model-based ASV system.

The density of interface states decreases with the increase in the annealing temperature.
doc	A Pati-Salam Version of Subcritical Hybrid Inflation EOS In this paper we present a model of subcritical hybrid inflation with a Pati-Salam [PS] symmetry group. EOS Both the inflaton and waterfall fields contribute to the necessary e-foldings of inflation, while only the waterfall field spontaneously breaks PS hence monopoles produced during inflation are diluted during the inflationary epoch. EOS The model is able to produce a tensor-to-scalar ratio, _EQN_ consistent with the latest BICEP2/Keck and Planck data, as well as scalar density perturbations and spectral index, _EQN_, consistent with Planck data. EOS For particular values of the parameters, we find _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS The energy density during inflation is directly related to the PS breaking scale, _EQN_.	The model also incorporates a _EQN_ symmetry which can resolve the _EQN_ problem and suppress dimension 5 operators for proton decay, leaving over an exact _EQN_ -parity.

EOS An exhaustive offline analysis of the data gave unique access to experimental effects potentially biasing the measurement. EOS After establishing the influence factors impacting the measurement such as after-pulses, pile-up, gain and base line fluctuations, their effects were accurately estimated and the event selection optimized. EOS The resulting half-life, _EQN_ ~s, is the most precise up to now for _EQN_ Ne.	It is found in agreement with two recent precise measurements and not consistent with the most recent one [L.J.

It is shown that the dynamical CPA+HA reproduces well the sublattice magnetization, the magnetizations, susceptibilities, and the N\'eel temperatures (_EQN_) as well as the Curie temperatures calculated by the Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) method.
doc	Non-ergodic Z-periodic billiards and infinite translation surfaces EOS We give a criterion which allows to prove non-ergodicity for certain infinite periodic billiards and directional flows on Z-periodic translation surfaces. EOS Our criterion applies in particular to a billiard in an infinite band with periodically spaced vertical barriers and to the Ehrenfest wind-tree model, which is a planar billiard with a _EQN_ -periodic array of rectangular obstacles.	We prove that, in these two examples, both for a full measure set of parameters of the billiard tables and for tables with rational parameters, for almost every direction the corresponding billiard flow is not ergodic and has uncountably many ergodic components.
doc	Breathing modes of long Josephson junctions with phase-shifts EOS We consider a spatially inhomogeneous sine-Gordon equation with a time-periodic drive, modeling a microwave driven long Josephson junction with phase-shifts. EOS Under appropriate conditions, Josephson junctions with phase-shifts can have a spatially nonuniform ground state. EOS In recent reports, it is experimentally shown that a microwave drive can be used to measure the eigenfrequency of a junction's ground state. EOS Such a microwave spectroscopy is based on the observation that when the frequency of the applied microwave is in the vicinity of the natural frequency of the ground state, the junction can switch to a resistive state, characterized by a non-zero junction voltage. EOS It was conjectured that the process is analogous to the resonant phenomenon in a simple pendulum motion driven by a time periodic external force. EOS In the case of long junctions with phase-shifts, it would be a resonance between the internal breathing mode of the ground state and the microwave field. EOS Nonetheless, it was also reported that the microwave power needed to switch the junction into a resistive state depends on the magnitude of the eigenfrequency to be measured. EOS Using multiple scale expansions, we show here that an infinitely long Josephson junction with phase-shifts cannot be switched to a resistive state by microwave field with frequency close to the system's eigenfrequency, provided that the applied microwave amplitude is small enough, which confirms the experimental observations. EOS It is because higher harmonics with frequencies in the continuous spectrum are excited, in the form of continuous wave radiation. EOS The presence of applied microwaves balances the nonlinear damping, creating a stable breather mode oscillation.	We confirm our analytical results numerically.
doc	Principal fiber bundle description of number scaling for scalars and vectors: Application to gauge theory EOS The purpose of this paper is to put the description of number scaling and its effects on physics and geometry on a firmer foundation, and to make it more understandable. EOS A main point is that two different concepts, number and number value are combined in the usual representations of number structures. EOS This is valid as long as just one structure of each number type is being considered. EOS It is not valid when different structures of each number type are being considered. EOS Elements of base sets of number structures, considered by themselves, have no meaning. EOS They acquire meaning or value as elements of a number structure. EOS Fiber bundles over a space or space time manifold, M, are described. EOS The fiber consists of a collection of many real or complex number structures and vector space structures. EOS The structures are parameterized by a real or complex scaling factor, s. EOS A vector space at a fiber level, s, has, as scalars, real or complex number structures at the same level. EOS Connections are described that relate scalar and vector space structures at both neighbor M locations and at neighbor scaling levels. EOS Scalar and vector structure valued fields are described and covariant derivatives of these fields are obtained.	Two complex vector fields, each with one real and one imaginary field, appear, with one complex field associated with positions in _EQN_ and the other with position dependent scaling factors.
doc	Oblivious Location-Based Service Query EOS Privacy-preserving location-base services (LBS) have been proposed to protect users' location privacy. EOS However, there are still some problems in existing schemes: (1) a semi-trusted third party (TTP) is required; EOS or (2) both the computation cost and communication cost to generate a query are linear in the size of the queried area. EOS In this paper, to improve query efficiency, an oblivious location-based service query (OLBSQ) scheme is proposed. EOS Our scheme captures the following features: (1) a semi-trusted TTP is not required; EOS (2) a user can query services from a service provider without revealing her exact location; EOS (3) the service provider can only know the size of a query made by a user; EOS and (4) both the computation cost and the communication cost to generate a query is constant, instead of linear in the size of the queried area. EOS We formalise the definition and security model of OLBSQ schemes.	The security of our scheme is reduced to well-known complexity assumptions.
doc	Dynamically Polarizing Spin Register of NV Centers in Diamond using Chopped Laser Pulses EOS Nuclear spins nearby nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are excellent quantum memory for quantum computing and quantum sensing, but are difficult to be initialized due to their weak interactions with the environment. EOS Here we propose and demonstrate a magnetic-field-independent, deterministic and highly efficient polarization scheme by introducing chopped laser pulses into the double-resonance initialization method. EOS With this method, we demonstrate initialization of single-nuclear-spin approaching _EQN_ and a _EQN_ - _EQN_ double-nuclear-spin system approaching _EQN_ at room temperature.	The initialization is limited by a nuclear-spin depolarization effect due to chopped laser excitation.

doc	The four leading arms of the Magellanic Cloud system EOS The Magellanic Cloud System (MCS) interacts via tidal and drag forces with the Milky Way galaxy. EOS Using the Parkes Galactic All-Sky Survey (GASS) of atomic hydrogen we explore the role of drag on the evolution of the so-called Leading Arm (LA). EOS We present a new image recognition algorithm that allows us to differentiate features within a 3-D data cube (longitude, latitude, radial velocity) and to parameterize individual coherent structures. EOS We compiled an HI object catalog of LA objects within an area of 70 degr x 85 degr (1.6 sr) of the LA region. EOS This catalog comprises information of location, column density, line width, shape and asymmetries of the individual LA objects above the 4-sigma threshold of Delta T_b simeq 200 mK. EOS We present evidence of a fourth arm segment (LA4). EOS For all LA objects we find an inverse correlation of velocities v_GSR in Galactic Standard of Rest frame with Magellanic longitude. EOS High-mass objects tend to have higher radial velocities than low-mass ones. EOS About 1/4 of all LA objects can be characterized as head-tail (HT) structures.	Using image recognition with objective criteria, it is feasible to isolate most of LA emission from the diffuse Milky Way HI gas.

EOS The reinsurer, as the leader of the Stackelberg game, can price reinsurance premium and invest its wealth in a financial market that contains a risk-free asset and a risky asset. EOS The two insurers, as the followers of the Stackelberg game, can purchase proportional reinsurance from the reinsurer and invest in the same financial market. EOS The competitive relationship between two insurers is modeled by the non-zero-sum game, and their decision making will consider the relative performance measured by the difference in their terminal wealth. EOS We consider wealth processes with delay to characterize the bounded memory feature. EOS This paper aims to find the equilibrium strategy for the reinsurer and insurers by maximizing the expected utility of the reinsurer's terminal wealth with delay and maximizing the expected utility of the combination of insurers' terminal wealth and the relative performance with delay. EOS By using the idea of backward induction and the dynamic programming approach, we derive the equilibrium strategy and value functions explicitly. EOS Then, we provide the corresponding verification theorem. EOS Finally, some numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the effects of model parameters on the equilibrium strategy. EOS We find the delay factor discourages or stimulates investment depending on the length of delay.	Moreover, competitive factors between two insurers make their optimal reinsurance-investment strategy interact, and reduce reinsurance demand and reinsurance premium price.
doc	A Near-Optimal Scheme for TCP ACK Pacing to Maintain Throughput in Wireless Networks EOS The advent of fourth generation technologies in wireless networks and the rapid growth of 3G have heralded an era that will require researchers to find reliable and easily implement-able solutions to the problem of poor TCP performance in the wireless environment. EOS Since a large part of the Internet is TCP-based, solving this problem will be instrumental in determining if the move from wired to wireless will be seamless or not. EOS This paper proposes a scheme that uses the base station's ability to predict the time at which the link may be going down and to estimate the period for which the mobile would be unreachable due to conditions like fading.	By using cross-layer and ACK pacing algorithms, the base station prevents the fixed host from timing out while waiting for ACKs from the mobile.
doc	Local Fourier Analysis of the Complex Shifted Laplacian preconditioner for Helmholtz problems EOS In this paper we solve the Helmholtz equation with multigrid preconditioned Krylov subspace methods. EOS The class of Shifted Laplacian preconditioners are known to significantly speed-up Krylov convergence. EOS However, these preconditioners have a parameter beta, a measure of the complex shift. EOS Due to contradictory requirements for the multigrid and Krylov convergence, the choice of this shift parameter can be a bottleneck in applying the method.	In this paper, we propose a wavenumber-dependent minimal complex shift parameter which is predicted by a rigorous k-grid Local Fourier Analysis (LFA) of the multigrid scheme.
doc	Symmetric Rearrangements Around Infinity with Applications to Levy Processes EOS We prove a new rearrangement inequality for multiple integrals, which partly generalizes a result of Friedberg and Luttinger (1976) and can be interpreted as involving symmetric rearrangements of domains around infinity. EOS As applications, we prove two comparison results for general Levy processes and their symmetric rearrangements. EOS The first application concerns the survival probability of a point particle in a Poisson field of moving traps following independent Levy motions. EOS We show that the survival probability can only increase if the point particle does not move, and the traps and the Levy motions are symmetrically rearranged. EOS This essentially generalizes an isoperimetric inequality of Peres and Sousi (2011) for the Wiener sausage.	In the second application, we show that the q-capacity of a Borel measurable set for a Levy process can only decrease if the set and the Levy process are symmetrically rearranged.

doc	Indefinite Mean-Field Type Linear-Quadratic Stochastic Optimal Control Problems EOS This paper focuses on indefinite stochastic mean-field linear-quadratic (MF-LQ, for short) optimal control problems, which allow the weighting matrices for state and control in the cost functional to be indefinite. EOS The solvability of stochastic Hamiltonian system and Riccati equations is presented under both positive definite case and indefinite case.	The optimal controls in open-loop form and closed-loop form are obtained, respectively.
doc	Tsallis statistics as a tool for studying interstellar turbulence EOS We used magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of interstellar turbulence to study the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of increments of density, velocity, and magnetic field. EOS We found that the PDFs are well described by a Tsallis distribution, following the same general trends found in solar wind and Electron MHD studies. EOS We found that the PDFs of density are very different in subsonic and supersonic turbulence.	In order to extend this work to ISM observations we studied maps of column density obtained from 3D MHD simulations.

For nonpositively curved perturbations of parabolic cylinders we establish the existence of a logarithmically large resonance free region.
doc	Machta-Zwanzig regime of anomalous diffusion in infinite-horizon billiards EOS We study diffusion on a periodic billiard table with infinite horizon in the limit of narrow corridors. EOS An effective trapping mechanism emerges according to which the process can be modeled by a L\'evy walk combining exponentially-distributed trapping times with free propagation along paths whose precise probabilities we compute. EOS This description yields an approximation of the mean squared displacement of infinite-horizon billiards in terms of two transport coefficients which generalizes to this anomalous regime the Machta-Zwanzig approximation of normal diffusion in finite-horizon billiards [Phys. EOS Rev.	Lett.
doc	Hot gas flows on global and nuclear galactic scales EOS Since its discovery as an X-ray source with the Einstein Observatory, the hot X-ray emitting interstellar medium of early-type galaxies has been studied intensively, with observations of improving quality, and with extensive modeling by means of numerical simulations.	The main features of the hot gas evolution are outlined here, focussing on the mass and energy input rates, the relationship between the hot gas flow and the main properties characterizing its host galaxy, the flow behavior on the nuclear and global galactic scales, and the sensitivity of the flow to the shape of the stellar mass distribution and the mean rotation velocity of the stars.
doc	On the scatter in the relation between stellar mass and halo mass: random or halo formation time dependent? EOS The empirical HOD model of Wang et al 2006 fits, by construction, both the stellar mass function and correlation function of galaxies in the local Universe. EOS In contrast, the semi-analytical models of De Lucia & Blazoit 2007 (DLB07) and Guo et al 2011 (Guo11), built on the same dark matter halo merger trees than the empirical model, still have difficulties in reproducing these observational data simultaneously. EOS We compare the relations between the stellar mass of galaxies and their host halo mass in the three models, and find that they are different. EOS When the relations are rescaled to have the same median values and the same scatter as in Wang et al, the rescaled DLB07 model can fit both the measured galaxy stellar mass function and the correlation function measured in different galaxy stellar mass bins. EOS In contrast, the rescaled Guo11 model still over-predicts the clustering of low-mass galaxies.	This indicates that the detail of how galaxies populate the scatter in the stellar mass -- halo mass relation does play an important role in determining the correlation functions of galaxies.
doc	The Escaramujo Project: instrumentation courses during a road trip across the Americas EOS The Escaramujo Project was a series of eight hands-on laboratory courses on High Energy Physics and Astroparticle Instrumentation, in Latinamerican Institutions. EOS The Physicist Federico Izraelevitch traveled on a van with his wife and dogs from Chicago to Buenos Aires teaching the courses. EOS The sessions took place at Institutions in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia at an advanced undergraduate and graduate level. EOS During these workshops, each group built a modern cosmic ray detector based on plastic scintillator and silicon photomultipliers, designed specifically for this project. EOS After the courses, a functional detector remained at each institution to be used by the faculty to facilitate the training of future students and to support and enable local research activities. EOS The five-days workshops covered topics such as elementary particle and cosmic ray Physics, radiation detection and instrumentation, low-level light sensing with solid state devices, front-end analog electronics and object-oriented data analysis (C++ and ROOT). EOS Throughout this initiative, about a hundred of talented and highly motivated young students were reached.	With the detector as a common thread, they were able to understand the designing principles and the underlying Physics involved in it, build the device, start it up, characterize it, take data and analyze it, mimicking the stages of a real elementary particle Physics experiment.
doc	The AMIGA sample of isolated galaxies. VI. Radio continuum properties of isolated galaxies: a very radio quiet sample EOS The study of the radio properties of the AMIGA sample is intended to characterize the radio continuum emission for a sample least affected by local environment, thus providing a reference against which less isolated and interacting samples can be compared. EOS Radio continuum data at 325, 1420 and 4850 MHz were extracted from the WENSS, NVSS/FIRST and GB6 surveys, respectively. EOS We focus on the complete AMIGA subsample composed of 719 galaxies. EOS Comparison between the NVSS and FIRST detections indicates that the radio continuum is coming from disk-dominated emission in spiral galaxies, in contrast to the results found in high-density environments where nuclear activity is more frequent. EOS The comparison of the radio continuum power with a comparable sample, which is however not selected with respect to its environment, the Condon et al UGC-SF sample of star-forming field galaxies, shows a lower mean value for the AMIGA sample. EOS We have obtained radio-to-optical flux ratios (R) using the NVSS radio continuum flux. EOS The distribution of R for the AMIGA galaxies is consistent with a sample dominated by radio emission from star formation (SF) and a small number of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), with less than 3% of the sample with R > 100. EOS We derived the radio luminosity function (RLF) and total power density of the radio continuum emission for the AMIGA sample at 1.4 GHz, and compared them with results from other low redshift studies. EOS The Schechter fit of the RLF indicates a major weight of the low-luminosity galaxies.	The results indicate the very low level of radio continuum emission in our sample of isolated galaxies, which is dominated by mild disk SF.
doc	Quasisymmetric conjugacy between quadratic dynamics and iterated function systems EOS We consider linear iterated function systems (IFS) with a constant contraction ratio in the plane for which the "overlap set" _EQN_ is finite, and which are "invertible" on the attractor _EQN_, the sense that there is a continuous surjection _EQN_ whose inverse branches are the contractions of the IFS. EOS The overlap set is the critical set in the sense that _EQN_ is not a local homeomorphism precisely at _EQN_. EOS We suppose also that there is a rational function _EQN_ with the Julia set _EQN_ such that _EQN_ and _EQN_ are conjugate. EOS We prove that if _EQN_ has bounded turning and _EQN_ has no parabolic cycles, then the conjugacy is quasisymmetric. EOS This result is applied to some specific examples including an uncountable family. EOS Our main focus is on the family of IFS _EQN_ where _EQN_ is a complex parameter in the unit disk, such that its attractor _EQN_ is a dendrite, which happens whenever _EQN_ is a singleton. EOS C. EOS Bandt observed that a simple modification of such an IFS (without changing the attractor) is invertible and gives rise to a quadratic-like map _EQN_ on _EQN_. EOS If the IFS is post-critically finite, then a result of A.	Kameyama shows that there is a quadratic map _EQN_, with the Julia set _EQN_ such that _EQN_ and _EQN_ are conjugate.

doc	Radion and Large Scale Anisotropy on the Brane EOS We investigate the effect of the radion on cosmological perturbations in the brane world. EOS The S^1/Z_2 compactified 5D Anti-de Sitter spacetime bounded by positive and negative tension branes is considered. EOS The radion is the relative displacement of the branes in this model. EOS We find two different kinds of the radion at the linear perturbation order for a cosmological brane. EOS One describes a "fluctuation" of the brane which does not couple to matter on the brane. EOS The other describes a "bend" of the brane which couples to the matter. EOS The bend determines the curvature perturbation on the brane. EOS At large scales, the radion interacts with anisotopic perturbations in the bulk. EOS By solving the bulk anisotropic perturbations, large scale metric perturbations and anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) on the positive tension brane are calculated. EOS We find an interesting fact that the radion contributes to the CMB anisotropies.	The observational consequences of these effects are discussed.
doc	Minimal representations via Bessel operators EOS We construct an L^2-model of "very small" irreducible unitary representations of simple Lie groups G which, up to finite covering, occur as conformal groups Co(V) of simple Jordan algebras V. EOS If _EQN_ is split and G is not of type A_n, then the representations are minimal in the sense that the annihilators are the Joseph ideals. EOS Our construction allows the case where G does not admit minimal representations. EOS In particular, applying to Jordan algebras of split rank one we obtain the entire complementary series representations of SO(n,1)_0.	A distinguished feature of these representations in all cases is that they attain the minimum of the Gelfand--Kirillov dimensions among irreducible unitary representations.
doc	Collectivity of the electromagnetic transitions in near-threshold resonances EOS Mixing of the shell model (SM) eigenstates due to the coupling via the common decay channel leads in many cases to the formation of a collective eigenstate which carries many features of the nearby decay channel.

doc	Exploiting Semiconductor Properties for Hardware Trojans EOS This paper discusses the possible introduction of hidden reliability defects during CMOS foundry fabrication processes that may lead to accelerated wearout of the devices. EOS These hidden defects or hardware Trojans can be created by deviation from foundry design rules and processing parameters. EOS The Trojans are produced by exploiting time-based wearing mechanisms (HCI, NBTI, TDDB and EM) and/or condition-based triggers (ESD, Latchup and Softerror). EOS This class of latent damage is difficult to test due to its gradual degradation nature.	The paper describes life-time expectancy results for various Trojan induced scenarios.
doc	Nontrilocality: Exploiting nonlocality from three particle systems EOS In Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS \textbf 104,170401 (2010), Branciard \textit e.t al. EOS first characterized the correlations arising in an entanglement swapping network under the assumption that the sources generating the initially uncorrelated quantum systems are independent. EOS Precisely speaking, in Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS \textbf 104,170401 (2010) and later in Phys. EOS Rev. EOS A \textbf 85,032119 (2012) the authors analyzed the importance of \textit bilocal (source independence) assumption to lower down the restrictions over correlations for revealing quantumness in the network where each of two sources generates a bipartite entangled state. EOS In this context one may find interest to characterize correlations in a network involving independent sources which can correlate more than two initially uncorrelated multipartite entangled quantum systems. EOS Our present topic of discussion basically analyzes such a network scenario.	Specifically we introduce \textit trilocal network scenario where each of three sources independently generates a tripartite entangled quantum system thereby exploring the role of source independence assumption to exploit nonlocality in a network involving multipartite entanglement analogous to bilocal assumption in a network where only bipartite entanglement was considered.
doc	B-R Colors of Globular Clusters in NGC 6166 (A2199) EOS We have analysed new R-band photometry of globular clusters in NGC 6166, the cD galaxy in the cooling flow cluster A2199. EOS In combination with the earlier B photometry of Pritchet \& Harris (1990), we obtain B _EQN_ R colours for _EQN_ 40 globular clusters in NGC 6166. EOS The mean B _EQN_ R is 1.26 _EQN_ 0.11, corresponding to a mean [Fe/H] = _EQN_ 1 _EQN_ 0.4. EOS Given that NGC 6166 is one of the most luminous cD galaxies studied to date, our result implies significant scatter in the relationship between mean cluster [Fe/H] and parent galaxy luminosity. EOS We obtain a globular cluster specific frequency of S _EQN_ _EQN_ 9, with a possible range between 5 and 18. EOS This value is inconsistent with the value of S _EQN_ _EQN_ 4 determined earlier by Pritchet \& Harris (1990) from B-band photometry, and we discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy.	Finally, we reassess whether or not cooling flows are an important mechanism for forming globular clusters in gE/cD galaxies.

doc	Stiffening of Red Blood Cells Induced by Disordered Cytoskeleton Structures: A Joint Theory-experiment Study EOS The functions and elasticities of the cell are largely related to the structures of the cytoskeletons underlying the lipid bi-layer. EOS Among various cell types, the Red Blood Cell (RBC) possesses a relatively simple cytoskeletal structure. EOS Underneath the membrane, the RBC cytoskeleton takes the form of a two dimensional triangular network, consisting of nodes of actins (and other proteins) and edges of spectrins. EOS Recent experiments focusing on the malaria infected RBCs (iRBCs) showed that there is a correlation between the elongation of spectrins in the cytoskeletal network and the stiffening of the iRBCs. EOS Here we rationalize the correlation between these two observations by combining the worm-like chain (WLC) model for single spectrins and the Effective Medium Theory (EMT) for the network elasticity. EOS We specifically focus on how the disorders in the cytoskeletal network affect its macroscopic elasticity. EOS Analytical and numerical solutions from our model reveal that the stiffness of the membrane increases with increasing end-to-end distances of spectrins, but has a non-monotonic dependence on the variance of the end-to-end distance distributions.	These predictions are verified quantitively by our AFM and micropipette aspiration measurements of iRBCs.
doc	First-principles molecular-dynamics simulations of a hydrous silica melt: Structural properties and hydrogen diffusion mechanism EOS We use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study a sample of liquid silica containing 3.84 wt.% H _EQN_ O.We find that, for temperatures of 3000 K and 3500 K,water is almost exclusively dissolved as hydroxyl groups, the silica network is partially broken and static and dynamical properties of the silica network change considerably upon the addition of water.Water molecules or free O-H groups occur only at the highest temperature but are not stable and disintegrate rapidly.Structural properties of this system are compared to those of pure silica and sodium tetrasilicate melts at equivalent temperatures.	These comparisons confirm the picture of a partially broken tetrahedral network in the hydrous liquid and suggest that the structure of the matrix is as much changed by the addition of water than it is by the addition of the same amount (in mole %) of sodium oxide.

doc	Entanglement indicators for quantum optical fields: three-mode multiport beamsplitters EPR interference experiments EOS We generalize a new approach to entanglement conditions for light of undefined photons numbers given in [Phys. EOS Rev. EOS A 95, 042113 (2017)] for polarization correlations to a broader family of interferometric phenomena. EOS Integrated optics allows one to perform experiments based upon multiport beamsplitters. EOS To observe entanglement effects one can use multi-mode parametric down-conversion emissions. EOS When the structure of the Hamiltonian governing the emissions has (infinitely) many equivalent Schmidt decompositions into modes (beams), one can have perfect EPR-like correlations of numbers of photons emitted into "conjugate modes" which can be monitored at spatially separated detection stations. EOS We provide entanglement conditions for experiments involving three modes on each side, and three-input-three-output multiport beamsplitters, and show their violations by bright squeezed vacuum states.	We show that a condition expressed in terms of averages of observed rates is a much better entanglement indicator than a related one for the usual intensity variables.
doc	Theory of box-model hyperfine couplings and transport signatures of long-range nuclear-spin coherence in a quantum-dot spin valve EOS We have theoretically analyzed coherent nuclear-spin dynamics induced by electron transport through a quantum-dot spin valve. EOS The hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins in a quantum dot allows for the transfer of angular momentum from spin-polarized electrons injected from ferromagnetic or half-metal leads to the nuclear spin system under a finite voltage bias.	Accounting for a local nuclear-spin dephasing process prevents the system from becoming stuck in collective dark states, allowing a large nuclear polarization to be built up in the long-time limit.
doc	Pseudo-differential representation of the metaplectic transform and its application to fast algorithms EOS The metaplectic transform (MT), also known as the linear canonical transform, is a unitary integral mapping which is widely used in signal processing and can be viewed as a generalization of the Fourier transform. EOS For a given function _EQN_ on an _EQN_ -dimensional continuous space _EQN_, the MT of _EQN_ is parameterized by a rotation (or more generally, a linear symplectic transformation) of the _EQN_ -dimensional phase space _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the wavevector space dual to _EQN_. EOS Here, we derive a pseudo-differential form of the MT. EOS For small-angle rotations, or near-identity transformations of the phase space, it readily yields asymptotic \textit differential representations of the MT, which are easy to compute numerically. EOS Rotations by larger angles are implemented as successive applications of _EQN_ small-angle MTs.	The algorithm complexity scales as _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the number of grid points.

doc	Early Detection of Rogue Waves Using Compressive Sensing EOS We discuss the possible usage of the compressive sampling for the early detection of rogue waves. EOS One of the promising techniques for the early detection of the oceanic rogue waves is to measure the triangular Fourier spectra which begin to appear at the early stages of their development.	For the early detection of the rogue waves it is possible to treat such a spectrum as a sparse signal since we would mainly be interested in the high amplitude triangular region located at the central wavenumber.

doc	Alternative approach to electromagnetic field quantization in nonlinear and inhomogeneous media EOS A simple approach is proposed for the quantization of the electromagnetic field in nonlinear and inhomogeneous media. EOS Given the dielectric function and nonlinear susceptibilities, the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field is determined completely by this quantization method. EOS From Heisenberg's equations we derive Maxwell's equations for the field operators. EOS When the nonlinearity goes to zero, this quantization method returns to the generalized canonical quantization procedure for linear inhomogeneous media [Phys. EOS Rev. EOS A, 43, 467, 1991].	The explicit Hamiltonians for the second-order and third-order nonlinear quasi-steady-state processes are obtained based on this quantization procedure.

doc	A parameter-free population-dynamical approach to health workforce supply forecasting of EU countries EOS Many countries face challenges like impending retirement waves, negative population growth, or a suboptimal distribution of resources across medical sectors and fields in supplying their healthcare systems with adequate staffing. EOS An increasing number of countries therefore employs quantitative approaches in health workforce supply forecasting. EOS However, these models are often of limited usability as they either require extensive individual-level data or become too simplistic to capture key demographic or epidemiological factors. EOS We propose a novel population-dynamical and stock-flow-consistent approach to health workforce supply forecasting complex enough to address dynamically changing behaviors while requiring only publicly available timeseries data for complete calibration. EOS We apply the model to 21 European countries to forecast the supply of generalist and specialist physicians until 2040.	Compared to staffing levels required to keep the physician density constant at 2016 levels, in many countries we find a significant trend toward decreasing density for generalist physicians at the expense of increasing densities for specialists.
doc	An analysis of the benefits of signal injection for low-speed sensorless control of induction motors EOS We analyze why low-speed sensorless control of the IM is intrinsically difficult, and what is gained by signal injection.

We show that the IM is not observable when the stator speed is zero in the absence of signal injection, but that observability is restored thanks to signal injection and magnetic saturation.

doc	Origin of the thermodynamic time arrow demonstrated in a realistic statistical system EOS Emergence of one-time-direction macroscopic evolution of a classical system of two mixed gases having different temperatures is derived and explained. EOS The analysis performed at the microscopic level, where the time-symmetric laws of mechanics govern the particles collisions, leads to a time-asymmetric macroscopic heat transfer equation and a theorem analogous to the Boltzmann H-theorem. EOS Some statistical symmetries in the velocity distribution that should be satisfied by the incoming and outgoing particles are pointed out. EOS The time reversed evolution is shown to be highly improbable because in this case these typical symmetries are broken.	Additionally, some remarks explaining implicit time-asymmetry of the Boltzmann ph Stosszahlansatz are made.
doc	Gravitational sources induced by exotic smoothness and fermions as knot complements EOS In this paper we will discuss Brans conjecture that exotic smoothness serves as an additional gravitational source naturally arising from the handlebody construction of the exotic _EQN_.

EOS Then we discuss the physical properties of these spinor fields to relate them to fermions. EOS Finally we identify the corresponding 3-manifolds as knot complements of hyperbolic knots, i.e.	the knot complements are hyperbolic 3-manifolds with finite volume.
doc	Anisotropic Dirac fermions in a Bi square net of SrMnBi2 EOS We report the highly anisotropic Dirac fermions in a Bi square net of SrMnBi2, based on a first principle calculation, angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and quantum oscillations for high-quality single crystals. EOS We found that the Dirac dispersion is generally induced in the (SrBi)+ layer containing a double-sized Bi square net. EOS In contrast to the commonly observed isotropic Dirac cone, the Dirac cone in SrMnBi2 is highly anisotropic with a large momentum-dependent disparity of Fermi velocities of ~ 8.	These findings demonstrate that a Bi square net, a common building block of various layered pnictides, provide a new platform that hosts highly anisotropic Dirac fermions.

doc	The Lyman break analogue Haro 11: spatially resolved chemodynamics with VLT FLAMES EOS Using VLT/FLAMES optical integral field unit observations, we present the first spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the well known blue compact galaxy Haro11, thought to be a local analogue to high redshift Lyman Break Galaxies. EOS Haro11 displays complex emission line profiles, consisting of narrow (FWHM<200 km/s) and broad (FWHM 200-300 km/s) components. EOS We identify three distinct emission knots kinematically connected to one another. EOS A chemodynamical analysis is presented, revealing that spatially resolved ionic and elemental abundances do not agree with those derived from integrated spectra across the galaxy. EOS We conclude that this is almost certainly due to the surface-brightness-weighting of electron temperature in integrated spectra, leading to higher derived abundances. EOS We find that the eastern knot has a low gas density, but a higher temperature (by ~4,000 K) and consequently an oxygen abundance ~0.4 dex lower than the neighbouring regions. EOS A region of enhanced N/O is found specifically in Knot C, confirming previous studies that found anomalously high N/O ratios in this system. EOS Maps of the Wolf-Rayet feature at 4686A reveal large WR populations (~900-1500 stars) in Knots A and B. EOS The lack of WR stars in Knot C, combined with an age of ~7.4 Myr suggest that a recently completed WR phase may be responsible for the observed N/O excess.	Conversely, the absence of N-enriched gas and strong WR emission in Knots A and B suggests we are observing these regions at an epoch where stellar ejecta has yet to cool and mix with the ISM.
doc	An Upper Bound on the Error Induced by Saddlepoint Approximations -- Applications to Information Theory EOS This paper introduces an upper bound on the absolute difference between: (a) the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the sum of a finite number of independent and identically distributed random variables with finite absolute third moment; EOS and (b) a saddlepoint approximation of such CDF. EOS This upper bound, which is particularly precise in the regime of large deviations, is used to study the dependence testing (DT) bound and the meta converse (MC) bound on the decoding error probability (DEP) in point-to-point memoryless channels. EOS Often, these bounds cannot be analytically calculated and thus lower and upper bounds become particularly useful. EOS Within this context, the main results include, respectively, new upper and lower bounds on the DT and MC bounds.	A numerical experimentation of these bounds is presented in the case of the binary symmetric channel, the additive white Gaussian noise channel, and the additive symmetric _EQN_ -stable noise channel.
doc	A Sensitive Faraday Rotation Setup Using Triple Modulation EOS The utilization of polarized targets in scattering experiments has become a common practice in many major accelerator laboratories. EOS Noble gases are especially suitable for such applications, since they can be easily hyper-polarized using spin exchange or metastable pumping techniques. EOS Polarized helium-3 is a very popular target because it often serves as an effective polarized neutron due to its simple nuclear structure. EOS A favorite cell material to generate and store polarized helium-3 is GE-180, a relatively dense aluminosilicate glass. EOS In this paper, we present a Faraday rotation method, using a new triple modulation technique, where the measurement of the Verdet constants of SF57 flint glass, pyrex glass, and air were tested. EOS The sensitivity obtained shows that this technique may be implemented in future cell wall characterization and thickness measurements.	We also discuss the first ever extraction of the Verdet constant of GE-180 glass for four wavelength values of 632 nm, 773 nm, 1500 nm, and 1547 nm, whereupon the expected 1/ \lambda ^ 2 dependence was observed.
doc	Queueing Analysis of Unicast IPTV With User Mobility and Adaptive Modulation and Coding in Wireless Cellular Networks EOS Unicast IPTV services that can support live TV, video-on-demand (VoD), video conferencing, and online gaming applications over broadband wireless cellular networks have been becoming popular in recent years. EOS However, video streaming services significantly impact the performance of wireless cellular networks because they are bandwidth hogs. EOS To maintain the system performance, effective admission control and resource allocation mechanisms based on an accurate mathematical analysis are required. EOS On the other hand, the quality of a wireless link usually changes with time due to the user mobility or time-varying channel characteristics. EOS To counteract such time-varying channels and improve the spectral efficiency, adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme can be adopted in offering unicast IPTV services for mobile users.	In this paper, closed-form solutions for the bandwidth usage, blocking rate, and dropping rate of unicast IPTV services over wireless cellular networks were derived based on the novel queueing model that considers both user mobility and AMC.

doc	Radiation defects in silicon due to hadrons and leptons, their annealing and influence on detector performance EOS A phenomenological model was developed to explain quantitatively, without free parameters, the production of primary defects in silicon after particle irradiation, the kinetics of their evolution toward equilibrium and their influence on detector parameters. EOS The type of the projectile particle and its energy is considered in the evaluation of the concentration of primary defects. EOS Vacancy-interstitial annihilation, interstitial migration to sinks, vacancy - impurity complexes (VP, VO, V2O), and divacancy (V2) formation are taken into account in different irradiation conditions, for different concentrations of impurities in the semiconductor material, for 20 and 0 degrees C. EOS The model can be extended to include other vacancy and interstitial complexes. EOS The density of the reverse current in the detector after irradiation is estimated. EOS Comparison with experimental measurements is performed.	A special application considered in the paper is the modelled case of the behaviour of silicon detectors operating in the pion field estimated for the LHC accelerator, under continuum generation and annealing.

EOS Previous sparse approximation approaches used a geometrically constructed multilevel hierarchy. EOS Instead, we construct this hierarchy for a given discretized problem by means of the algebraic multigrid method (AMG).	Thereby, we are able to apply the sparse grid combination technique to problems given on complex geometries and for discretizations arising from unstructured grids, which was not feasible before.

doc	Diffusion-limited exciton-exciton annihilation in single-walled carbon nanotubes: A time-dependent analysis EOS To provide physical insight into the recently observed photoluminescence saturation behaviors in single-walled carbon nanotubes implying the existence of an upper limit of exciton densities, we have performed a time-dependent theoretical study of diffusion-limited exciton-exciton annihilation in the general context of reaction-diffusion processes, for which exact treatments exist. EOS By including the radiative recombination decay as a Poissonian process in the exactly-solvable problem of one-dimensional diffusion-driven two-particle annihilation, we were able to correctly model the dynamics of excitons as a function of time with different initial densities, which in turn allowed us to reproduce the experimentally observed photoluminescence saturation behavior at high exciton densities. EOS We also performed Monte Carlo simulations of the purely stochastic, Brownian diffusive motion of one-dimensional excitons, which validated our analytical results.	Finally, we consider the temperature-dependence of this diffusion-limited exciton-exciton annihilation and point out that high excitonic densities in SWNTs could be achieved at low temperature in an external magnetic field.

EOS Itinerant spins interact with lattice spins via a distance-dependent interaction. EOS We also take into account an interaction between itinerant spins.	The lattice is frustrated in a range of _EQN_ in which we show that it undergoes a very strong first-order transition.

EOS These data-random digraphs are from parametrized random digraph families called proximity catch digraphs (PCDs). EOS A related geometric digraph family, class cover catch digraph (CCCD), has been used to solve the class cover problem by using its approximate minimum dominating set.	CCCDs showed relatively good performance in the classification of imbalanced data sets, and although CCCDs have a convenient construction in _EQN_, finding minimum dominating sets is NP-hard and its probabilistic behaviour is not mathematically tractable except for _EQN_.

doc	Granular physics in low-gravity environments using DEM EOS Granular materials of different sizes are present on the surface of several atmosphere-less Solar System bodies. EOS The phenomena related to granular materials have been studied in the framework of the discipline called Granular Physics; EOS that has been studied experimentally in the laboratory and, in the last decades, by performing numerical simulations. EOS The Discrete Element Method simulates the mechanical behavior of a media formed by a set of particles which interact through their contact points. EOS The difficulty in reproducing vacuum and low-gravity environments makes numerical simulations the most promising technique in the study of granular media under these conditions. EOS In this work, relevant processes in minor bodies of the Solar System are studied using the Discrete Element Method. EOS Results of simulations of size segregation in low-gravity environments in the cases of the asteroids Eros and Itokawa are presented. EOS The segregation of particles with different densities was analysed, in particular, the case of comet P/Hartley 2. EOS The surface shaking in these different gravity environments could produce the ejection of particles from the surface at very low relative velocities. EOS The shaking causing the above processes is due to: impacts, explosions like the release of energy by the liberation of internal stresses or the re accommodation of material. EOS Simulations of the passage of impact-induced seismic waves through a granular medium were also performed.	We present several applications of the Discrete Element Methods for the study of the physical evolution of agglomerates of rocks under low-gravity environments.

doc	Spatial Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks EOS Generative adversary networks (GANs) suffer from training pathologies such as instability and mode collapse. EOS These pathologies mainly arise from a lack of diversity in their adversarial interactions. EOS Evolutionary generative adversarial networks apply the principles of evolutionary computation to mitigate these problems. EOS We hybridize two of these approaches that promote training diversity. EOS One, E-GAN, at each batch, injects mutation diversity by training the (replicated) generator with three independent objective functions then selecting the resulting best performing generator for the next batch. EOS The other, Lipizzaner, injects population diversity by training a two-dimensional grid of GANs with a distributed evolutionary algorithm that includes neighbor exchanges of additional training adversaries, performance based selection and population-based hyper-parameter tuning.	We propose to combine mutation and population approaches to diversity improvement.

doc	The Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey EOS With the Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the imaging of the Northern Galactic Cap is now complete. EOS The survey contains images and parameters of roughly 287 million objects over 9583 deg^2, and 1.27 million spectra of stars, galaxies, quasars and blank sky (for sky subtraction) selected over 7425 deg^2. EOS This release includes much more extensive stellar spectroscopy than previously, and also includes detailed estimates of stellar temperatures, gravities, and metallicities. EOS The results of improved photometric calibration are now available, with uncertainties of roughly 1% in g, r, i, and z, and 2% in u, substantially better than the uncertainties in previous data releases. EOS The spectra in this data release have improved wavelength and flux calibration, especially in the extreme blue and extreme red, leading to the qualitatively better determination of stellar types and radial velocities. EOS The spectrophotometric fluxes are now tied to point spread function magnitudes of stars rather than fiber magnitudes, giving a 0.35 mag change in the spectrophotometric flux scale.	Systematic errors in the velocity dispersions of galaxies have been fixed, and the results of two independent codes for determining spectral classifications and redshifts are made available.
doc	Morphological Classification of Local Luminous Infrared Galaxies EOS We present an analysis of the morphological classification of 89 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) sample using non-parametric coefficients and compare their morphology as a function of wavelength. EOS We rely on images obtained in the optical (B- and I-band) as well as in the infrared (H-band and 5.8 _EQN_ m).	Our classification is based on the calculation of _EQN_ and the second order of light (_EQN_) non-parametric coefficients which we explore as a function of stellar mass (_EQN_), infrared luminosity (_EQN_) and star formation rate (SFR).
doc	Bayesian cross-validation of geostatistical models EOS The problem of validating or criticising models for georeferenced data is challenging, since the conclusions can vary significantly depending on the locations of the validation set. EOS This work proposes the use of cross-validation techniques to assess the goodness of fit of spatial models in different regions of the spatial domain to account for uncertainty in the choice of the validation sets. EOS An obvious problem with the basic cross-validation scheme is that it is based on selecting only a few out of sample locations to validate the model, possibily making the conclusions sensitive to which partition of the data into training and validation cases is utilized. EOS A possible solution to this issue would be to consider all possible configurations of data divided into training and validation observations. EOS From a Bayesian point of view, this could be computationally demanding, as estimation of parameters usually requires Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. EOS To deal with this problem, we propose the use of estimated discrepancy functions considering all configurations of data partition in a computationally efficient manner based on sampling importance resampling. EOS In particular, we consider uncertainty in the locations by assigning a prior distribution to them.	Furthermore, we propose a stratified cross-validation scheme to take into account spatial heterogeneity, reducing the total variance of estimated predictive discrepancy measures considered for model assessment.
doc	Laboratory-based grain-shape models for simulating dust infrared spectra EOS Analysis of thermal dust emission spectra for dust mineralogy and physical grain properties depends on laboratory-measured or calculated comparison spectra. EOS Often, the agreement between these two kinds of spectra is not satisfactory because of the strong influence of the grain morphology on the spectra. EOS We investigate the ability of the statistical light-scattering model with a distribution of form factors (DFF model) to reproduce experimentally measured infrared extinction spectra for particles that are small compared to the wavelength. EOS We take advantage of new experimental spectra measured for free particles dispersed in air with accompanying information on the grain morphology. EOS For the calculations, we used DFFs that were derived for aggregates of spherical grains, as well as for compact grain shapes corresponding to Gaussian random spheres. EOS Irregular particle shapes require a DFF similar to that of a Gaussian random sphere with sigma=0.3, whereas roundish grain shapes are best fitted with that of a fractal aggregate of a fractal dimension 2.4-1.8. EOS In addition we used a fitting algorithm to obtain the best-fit DFFs for the various laboratory samples. EOS In this way we can independently derive information on the shape of the grains from their infrared spectra. EOS For anisotropic materials, different DFFs are needed for the different crystallographic axes.	This is due to a theoretical problem, which is inherent to all models that are simply averaging the contributions of the crystallographic directions.
doc	Rotation periods and astrometric motions of the Luhman 16AB brown dwarfs by high-resolution lucky-imaging monitoring EOS Context. EOS Photometric monitoring of the variability of brown dwarfs can provide useful information about the structure of clouds in their cold atmospheres. EOS The brown-dwarf binary system Luhman 16AB is an interesting target for such a study, as its components stand at the L/T transition and show high levels of variability. EOS Luhman 16AB is also the third closest system to the Solar system, allowing precise astrometric investigations with ground-based facilities. EOS Aims. EOS The aim of the work is to estimate the rotation period and study the astrometric motion of both components. EOS Methods. EOS We have monitored Luhman 16AB over a period of two years with the lucky-imaging camera mounted on the Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla, through a special i+z long-pass filter, which allowed us to clearly resolve the two brown dwarfs into single objects. EOS An intense monitoring of the target was also performed over 16 nights, in which we observed a peak-to-peak variability of 0.20 \pm 0.02 mag and 0.34 \pm 0.02 mag for Luhman 16A and 16B, respectively. EOS Results. EOS We used the 16-night time-series data to estimate the rotation period of the two components. EOS We found that Luhman 16B rotates with a period of 5.1 \pm 0.1 hr, in very good agreement with previous measurements. EOS For Luhman 16A, we report that it rotates slower than its companion and, even though we were not able to get a robust determination, our data indicate a rotation period of roughly 8 hr. EOS This implies that the rotation axes of the two components are well aligned and suggests a scenario in which the two objects underwent the same accretion process.	The 2-year complete dataset was used to study the astrometric motion of Luhman 16AB.

doc	Classical dynamics and particle transport in kicked billiards EOS We study nonlinear dynamics of the kicked particle whose motion is confined by square billiard. EOS The kick source is considered as localized at the center of square with central symmetric spatial distribution. EOS It is found that ensemble averaged energy of the particle diffusively grows as a function of time. EOS This growth is much more extensive than that of kicked rotor energy. EOS It is shown that momentum transfer distribution in kicked billiard is considerably different than that for kicked free particle. EOS Time-dependence of the ensemble averaged energy for different localizations of the kick source is also explored. EOS It is found that changing of localization doesn't lead to crucial changes in the time-dependence of the energy.	Also, escape and transport of particles are studied by considering kicked open billiard with one and three holes, respectively.

EOS To address this problem, we develop an e-government Privacy Preserving Mobile and Fog computing framework entitled PPMF that can trace infected and suspected cases nationwide.	We use personal mobile devices with contact tracing app and two types of stationary fog nodes, named Automatic Risk Checkers (ARC) and Suspected User Data Uploader Node (SUDUN), to trace community transmission alongside maintaining user data privacy.

EOS We compare the performance of the proposed model with the original VGG16 model. EOS The results show that the former has higher train efficiency, but lower mean average precisions(MAP). EOS To improve the MAP of the proposed model, we investigate the result fusion mode to form multi-channel identification model, the best MAP reaches 0.9998.	The number of model parameters is 13110, which is only 0.0082% of the VGG16 model.

doc	On topological cyclic homology EOS Topological cyclic homology is a refinement of Connes--Tsygan's cyclic homology which was introduced by B\"okstedt--Hsiang--Madsen in 1993 as an approximation to algebraic _EQN_ -theory. EOS There is a trace map from algebraic _EQN_ -theory to topological cyclic homology, and a theorem of Dundas--Goodwillie--McCarthy asserts that this induces an equivalence of relative theories for nilpotent immersions, which gives a way for computing _EQN_ -theory in various situations. EOS The construction of topological cyclic homology is based on genuine equivariant homotopy theory, the use of explicit point-set models, and the elaborate notion of a cyclotomic spectrum. EOS The goal of this paper is to revisit this theory using only homotopy-invariant notions. EOS In particular, we give a new construction of topological cyclic homology. EOS This is based on a new definition of the _EQN_ -category of cyclotomic spectra: We define a cyclotomic spectrum to be a spectrum _EQN_ with _EQN_ -action (in the most naive sense) together with _EQN_ -equivariant maps _EQN_ for all primes _EQN_. EOS Here _EQN_ is the Tate construction.	On bounded below spectra, we prove that this agrees with previous definitions.
doc	Thermoelectric imaging of structural disorder in epitaxial graphene EOS Heat is a familiar form of energy transported from a hot side to a colder side of an object, but not a notion associated with microscopic measurements of electronic properties. EOS A temperature difference within a material causes charge carriers, electrons or holes, to diffuse along the temperature gradient inducing a thermoelectric voltage. EOS Here we show that local thermoelectric measurements can yield high sensitivity imaging of structural disorder on the atomic and nanometre scales. EOS The thermopower measurement acts to amplify the variations in the local density of states at the Fermi-level, giving high differential contrast in thermoelectric signals.	Using this imaging technique, we uncovered point defects in the first layer of epitaxial graphene, which generate soliton-like domain wall line patterns separating regions of the different interlayer stacking of the second graphene layer.
doc	Finite-size and asymptotic behaviors of the gyration radius of knotted cylindrical polygons EOS Several nontrivial properties are shown for the mean square radius of gyration _EQN_ of ring polymers with a fixed knot type K. EOS Through computer simulation, we discuss both finite-size and asymptotic behaviors of the gyration radius under the topological constraint for self-avoiding polygons consisting of N cylindrical segments with radius r. EOS We find that the average size of ring polymers with a knot K can be much larger than that of no topological constraint. EOS The effective expansion due to the topological constraint depends strongly on the parameter r which is related to the excluded volume.	The topological expansion is particularly significant for the small r case, where the simulation result is associated with that of random polygons with the knot K.
doc	Does the detection of X-ray emission from SN1998bw support its association with GRB980425? EOS We show that the recent identification of X-ray emission from SN1998bw is naturally explained as synchrotron emission from a shock driven into the wind surrounding the progenitor by a mildly relativistic shell ejected by the supernova, the existence of which was inferred earlier from radio observations.	X-ray observations imply a shell energy E~10^ 49.7 erg, and constrain the initial shell velocity \beta*c and normalized wind mass loss rate, \dot m =(\dot M /10^ -5 M_sun/yr)/(v_w/10^3 km/s), to satisfy \beta^3*\dot m ~10^ -1.5.

EOS Our goal in this paper is to find a set of actuators minimizing the metric that measures the average energy consumption of the control inputs while ensuring structural controllability of the network. EOS As this problem is intractable, greedy algorithm can be used to obtain an approximate solution. EOS To provide a performance guarantee for this approach, we first define the submodularity ratio for the metric under consideration and then reformulate the structural controllability constraint as a matroid constraint. EOS This shows that the problem under study can be characterized by a matroid optimization involving a weakly submodular objective function.	Then, we derive a novel performance guarantee for the greedy algorithm applied to this class of optimization problems.

Distribution of Lya Absorbers EOS The first systematic study of the warm gas (T=10^4-5 K) distribution across a galaxy cluster is presented using multiple background QSOs to the Virgo Cluster. EOS We detect 25 Lya absorbers (N_HI = 10^13.1-15.4 cm^-2) in the Virgo velocity range toward 9 of 12 QSO sightlines observed with Cosmic Origin Spectrograph, with a cluster impact parameter range of 0.36-1.65 Mpc (0.23-1.05R_vir). EOS Including 18 Lya absorbers previously detected by STIS or GHRS toward 7 of 11 background QSOs in and around the Virgo Cluster, we establish a sample of 43 absorbers towards a total of 23 background probes for studying the incidence of Lya absorbers in and around the Virgo Cluster. EOS With these absorbers, we find: (1) warm gas is predominantly in the outskirts of the cluster and avoids the X-ray detected hot ICM. EOS Also, Lya absorption strength increases with cluster impact parameter. EOS (2) Lya absorbing warm gas traces cold HI emitting gas in the substructures of the Virgo Cluster. EOS (3) Including the absorbers associated with the surrounding substructures, the warm gas covering fraction (100% for N_HI > 10^13.1 cm^-2) is in agreement with cosmological simulations.	We speculate that the observed warm gas is part of large-scale gas flows feeding the cluster both the ICM and galaxies.
doc	_EQN_ -uniform hypergraphs and linear cycles EOS Gy\'arf\'as, Gy\H o ri and Simonovits proved that if a _EQN_ -uniform hypergraph with _EQN_ vertices has no linear cycles, then its independence number _EQN_. EOS The hypergraph consisting of vertex disjoint copies of a complete hypergraph _EQN_ on five vertices, shows that equality can hold. EOS They asked whether this bound can be improved if we exclude _EQN_ as a subhypergraph and whether such a hypergraph is _EQN_ -colorable.	In this paper we answer these questions affirmatively.

doc	Reconstruction of Potassium Concentrations with the ECG on Imbalanced Datasets EOS End-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are facing a 30% rise for the risk of lethal cardiac events (LCE) compared to non-CKD patients. EOS At the same time, these patients undergoing dialysis experience shifts in the potassium concentrations. EOS The increased risk of LCE paired with the concentration changes suggest a connection between LCE and concentration disbalances. EOS To prove this link, a continuous monitoring device for the ionic concentrations, e.g. EOS the ECG, is needed. EOS In this work, we want to answer if an optimised signal processing chain can improve the result quantify the influence of a disbalanced training dataset on the final estimation result. EOS The study was performed on a dataset consisting of 12-lead ECGs recorded during dialysis sessions of 32 patients. EOS We selected three features to find a mapping from ECG features to [K+]o: T-wave ascending slope, T-wave descending slope and T-wave amplitude. EOS A polynomial model of 3rd order was used to reconstruct the concentrations from these features. EOS We solved a regularised weighted least squares problem with a weighting matrix dependent on the frequency of each concentration in the dataset (frequent concentration weighted less). EOS By doing so, we tried to generate a model being suitable for the whole range of the concentrations.With weighting, errors are increasing for the whole dataset. EOS For the data partition with [K+]o<5 mmol/l, errors are increasing, for [K+]o _EQN_ 5 mmol/l, errors are decreasing.	However, and apart from the exact reconstruction results, we can conclude that a model being valid for all patients and not only the majority, needs to be learned with a more homogeneous dataset.
doc	The effect of disorder on the fracture nucleation process EOS The statistical properties of failure are studied in a fiber bundle model with thermal noise. EOS We show that the macroscopic failure is produced by a thermal activation of microcracks.

The case of a time dependent force and the validity of the Kaiser effects are also discussed.
doc	Deep Generative Model with Beta Bernoulli Process for Modeling and Learning Confounding Factors EOS While deep representation learning has become increasingly capable of separating task-relevant representations from other confounding factors in the data, two significant challenges remain.

EOS We acquire spherical light field datasets with two novel light field camera rigs designed for portable and efficient light field acquisition. EOS We introduce a novel real-time light field reconstruction algorithm that uses a per-view geometry and a disk-based blending field. EOS We also demonstrate how to use a light field prefiltering operation to project from a high-quality offline reconstruction model into our real-time model while suppressing artifacts. EOS We introduce a practical approach for compressing light fields by modifying the VP9 video codec to provide high quality compression with real-time, random access decompression.	We combine these components into a complete light field system offering convenient acquisition, compact file size, and high-quality rendering while generating stereo views at 90Hz on commodity VR hardware.
doc	Van der Waals density functionals applied to solids EOS The van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of Dion et al [Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS 92, 246401 (2004)] is a promising approach for including dispersion in approximate density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals. EOS Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature. EOS However, despite many applications, standard general tests on a broad range of materials are lacking. EOS Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring. EOS We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas phase dimers.	However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better.

doc	Lengthening and Extending Binary Private Information Retrieval Codes EOS It was recently shown by Fazeli et al that the storage overhead of a traditional _EQN_ -server private information retrieval (PIR) protocol can be significantly reduced using the concept of a _EQN_ -server PIR code. EOS In this work, we show that a family of _EQN_ -server PIR codes (with increasing dimensions and blocklengths) can be constructed from an existing _EQN_ -server PIR code through lengthening by a single information symbol and code extension by at most _EQN_ code symbols. EOS Furthermore, by extending a code construction notion from Steiner systems by Fazeli et al, we obtain a specific family of _EQN_ -server PIR codes. EOS Based on a code construction technique that lengthens and extends a _EQN_ -server PIR code simultaneously, a basic algorithm to find good (i.e., small blocklength) _EQN_ -server PIR codes is proposed. EOS For the special case of _EQN_, we find provably optimal PIR codes for code dimensions _EQN_, while for all _EQN_ we find codes of smaller blocklength than the best known codes from the literature.	Furthermore, in the case of _EQN_, we also find better codes for _EQN_.

EOS Then, we adopt a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the posterior class distributions using a patch-wise training strategy to better use the spatial information.	Next, spatial information is further considered by placing a spatial smoothness prior on the labels.

EOS Lett., 106, 115701 (2011)], is studied on the square and simple-cubic lattices. EOS In two and three dimensions, we find numerical evidence for a strongly discontinuous transition.	In two dimensions, the clusters at the threshold are compact with a fractal surface of fractal dimension _EQN_.
doc	Alzheimer's Disease Modelling and Staging through Independent Gaussian Process Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Brain Changes EOS Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by complex and largely unknown progression dynamics affecting the brain's morphology. EOS Although the disease evolution spans decades, to date we cannot rely on long-term data to model the pathological progression, since most of the available measures are on a short-term scale. EOS It is therefore difficult to understand and quantify the temporal progression patterns affecting the brain regions across the AD evolution. EOS In this work, we tackle this problem by presenting a generative model based on probabilistic matrix factorization across temporal and spatial sources.	The proposed method addresses the problem of disease progression modelling by introducing clinically-inspired statistical priors.
doc	Dynamic Scheduling of MPI-based Distributed Deep Learning Training Jobs EOS There is a general trend towards solving problems suited to deep learning with more complex deep learning architectures trained on larger training sets. EOS This requires longer compute times and greater data parallelization or model parallelization. EOS Both data and model parallelism have been historically faster in parameter server architectures, but data parallelism is starting to be faster in ring architectures due to algorithmic improvements. EOS In this paper, we analyze the math behind ring architectures and make an informed adaptation of dynamic scheduling to ring architectures. EOS To do so, we formulate a non-convex, non-linear, NP-hard integer programming problem and a new efficient doubling heuristic for its solution. EOS We build upon Horovod: an open source ring architecture framework over TensorFlow. EOS We show that Horovod jobs have a low cost to stop and restart and that stopping and restarting ring architecture jobs leads to faster completion times. EOS These two facts make dynamic scheduling of ring architecture jobs feasible.	Lastly, we simulate a scheduler using these runs and show a more than halving of average job time on some workload patterns.

doc	Neutron-Capture Elements in the Early Galaxy: Insights from a Large Sample of Metal-Poor Giants EOS New abundances for neutron-capture (n-capture) elements in a large sample of metal-poor giants from the Bond survey are presented. EOS The spectra were acquired with the KPNO 4-m echelle and coude feed spectrographs, and have been analyzed using LTE fine-analysis techniques with both line analysis and spectral synthesis. EOS Abundances of eight n-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu, Dy) in 43 stars have been derived from blue (lambda = 4070--4710, R~20,000, S/N ratio~100-200) echelle spectra and red (lambda = 6100--6180, R~22,000, S/N ratio~100-200) coude spectra, and the abundance of Ba only has been derived from the red spectra for an additional 27 stars. EOS Overall, the abundances show clear evidence for a large star-to-star dispersion in the heavy element-to-iron ratios. EOS The new data also confirm that at metallicities [Fe/H] <~ --2.4, the abundance pattern of the heavy (Z >= 56) n-capture elements in most giants is well-matched to a scaled Solar System r-process nucleosynthesis pattern.	The onset of the main r-process can be seen at [Fe/H] ~ --2.9.

doc	A Simple Proposal for Radial 3D Needlets EOS We present here a simple construction of a wavelet system for the three-dimensional ball, which we label ph Radial 3D Needlets.

The system is then obtained by weighting the projector operator built on the corresponding set of eigenfunctions, and performing a discretization step which turns out to be computationally very convenient.

doc	Split decomposition and graph-labelled trees: characterizations and fully-dynamic algorithms for totally decomposable graphs EOS In this paper, we revisit the split decomposition of graphs and give new combinatorial and algorithmic results for the class of totally decomposable graphs, also known as the distance hereditary graphs, and for two non-trivial subclasses, namely the cographs and the 3-leaf power graphs. EOS Precisely, we give strutural and incremental characterizations, leading to optimal fully-dynamic recognition algorithms for vertex and edge modifications, for each of these classes. EOS These results rely on a new framework to represent the split decomposition, namely the graph-labelled trees, which also captures the modular decomposition of graphs and thereby unify these two decompositions techniques.	The point of the paper is to use bijections between these graph classes and trees whose nodes are labelled by cliques and stars.

doc	Supermassive Neutron Stars in Axion _EQN_ Gravity EOS We investigated realistic neutron stars in axion _EQN_ gravity. EOS The coupling between curvature and axion field _EQN_ is assumed in the simple form _EQN_. EOS For the axion mass in the range _EQN_ eV the solitonic core within neutron star and corresponding halo with size _EQN_ km can exist. EOS Therefore the effective contribution of _EQN_ term grows inside the star and it leads to change of star parameters (namely, mass and radius). EOS We obtained the increase of star mass independent from central density for wide range of masses. EOS Therefore, maximal possible mass for given equation of state grows. EOS At the same time, the star radius increases not so considerably in comparison with GR. EOS Hence, our model may predict possible existence of supermassive compact stars with masses _EQN_ and radii _EQN_ km for realistic equation of state (we considered APR equation of state).	In General Relativity one can obtain neutron stars with such characteristics only for unrealistic, extremely stiff equations of state.
doc	The Asymptotic Efficiency of Improved Prediction Intervals EOS Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox (1994, p.319) modify an estimative prediction limit to obtain an improved prediction limit with better coverage properties. EOS Kabaila and Syuhada (2008) present a simulation-based approximation to this improved prediction limit, which avoids the extensive algebraic manipulations required for this modification. EOS We present a modification of an estimative prediction interval, analogous to the Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox modification, to obtain an improved prediction interval with better coverage properties. EOS We also present an analogue, for the prediction interval context, of this simulation-based approximation. EOS The parameter estimator on which the estimative and improved prediction limits and intervals are based is assumed to have the same asymptotic distribution as the (conditional) maximum likelihood estimator. EOS The improved prediction limit and interval depend on the asymptotic conditional bias of this estimator. EOS This bias can be very sensitive to very small changes in the estimator. EOS It may require considerable effort to find this bias. EOS We show, however, that the improved prediction limit and interval have asymptotic efficiencies that are functionally independent of this bias.	Thus, improved prediction limits and intervals obtained using the Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox type of methodology can conveniently be based on the (conditional) maximum likelihood estimator, whose asymptotic conditional bias is given by the formula of Vidoni (2004, p.144).

EOS Namely, let _EQN_ be a reduced irreducible root system of rank _EQN_, let _EQN_ be a commutative ring and let _EQN_ be two ideals of _EQN_.	We consider subgroups of the Chevalley group _EQN_ of type _EQN_ over _EQN_.

doc	Image-charge detection of the Rydberg states of surface electrons on liquid helium EOS We propose and experimentally demonstrate a new spectroscopic method, image-charge detection, for the Rydberg states of surface electrons on liquid helium. EOS The excitation of the Rydberg states of the electrons induces an image current in the circuit to which the electrons are capacitively coupled.	In contrast to the conventional microwave absorption measurement, this method makes it possible to resolve the transitions to high-lying Rydberg states of the surface electrons.
doc	Decomposition of conditional probability for high-order symbolic Markov chains EOS The main goal of the paper is to develop an estimate for the conditional probability function of random stationary ergodic symbolic sequences with elements belonging to a finite alphabet. EOS We elaborate a decomposition procedure for the conditional probability function of sequences considered as the high-order Markov chains. EOS We represent the conditional probability function as the sum of multi-linear memory function monomials of different orders (from zero up to the chain order). EOS This allows us to construct artificial sequences by method of successive iterations taking into account at each step of iterations increasingly more high correlations among random elements. EOS At weak correlations, the memory functions are uniquely expressed in terms of the high-order symbolic correlation functions.	The proposed method fills up the gap between two approaches: the likelihood estimation and the additive Markov chains.
doc	Searching for differences in Swift's intermediate GRBs EOS Gamma-ray bursts are usually classified through their high-energy emission into short-duration and long-duration bursts, which presumably reflect two different types of progenitors. EOS However, it has been shown on statistical grounds that a third, intermediate population is needed in this classification scheme, although an extensive study of the properties of this class has so far not been done. EOS The large amount of follow-up studies generated during the Swift era allows us to have a suficient sample to attempt a study of this third population through the properties of their prompt emission and their afterglows. EOS Our study is focused on a sample of GRBs observed by Swift during its first four years of operation. EOS The sample contains those bursts with measured redshift since this allows us to derive intrinsic properties. EOS Intermediate bursts are less energetic and have dimmer afterglows than long GRBs, especially when considering the X-ray light curves, which are on average one order of magnitude fainter than long bursts. EOS There is a less significant trend in the redshift distribution that places intermediate bursts closer than long bursts.	Except for this, intermediate bursts show similar properties to long bursts.
doc	Dynamics and stability of chimera states in two coupled populations of oscillators EOS We consider networks formed from two populations of identical oscillators, with uniform strength all-to-all coupling within populations, and also between populations, with a different strength. EOS Such systems are known to support chimera states in which oscillators within one population are perfectly synchronised while in the other the oscillators are incoherent, and have a different mean frequency from those in the synchronous population.	Assuming that the oscillators in the incoherent population always lie on a closed smooth curve _EQN_, we derive and analyse the dynamics of the shape of _EQN_ and the probability density on _EQN_, for four different types of oscillators.
doc	Rough solution for the Einstein Vacuum equations EOS This is the first in a series Of papers in which we initiate the study Of very rough solutions to the initial value problem for the Einstein Vacuum equations expressed relative to wave coordinates. EOS By very rough we mean solutions which cannot be constructed by the classical techniques Of energy estimates and Sobolev inequalities. EOS Following our previous work on quasilinear wave equations we develop new analytic methods based on Strichartz type inequalities which results in a gain of half a derivative relative to the classical result. EOS Thus our result requires only _EQN_ regularity for the data. EOS Our methods blend paradifferential techniques with a geometric approach to the derivation of decay estimates.	The latter allows us to take full advantage of the specific structure of the Einstein equations.

doc	Means and non-real Intersection Points of Taylor Polynomials EOS Suppose that f has continuous derivatives thru order r+1 for x>0, and let P_ c denote the Taylor polynomial to f of order r at x=c,c>0. EOS In a previous paper of the author, it was shown that if r is an odd whole number and the (r+1)st derivative of f is nonzero on [a,b], then there is a unique x_ 0,a<x_ 0 <b, such that P_ a (x_ 0)=P_ b (x_ 0). EOS This defines a mean, depending on f and r, given by m(a,b)=x_ 0. EOS In this paper we discuss the real parts of the pairs of complex conjugate non-real roots of P_ b -P_ a. EOS We prove some results for r in general, but our most significant results are for the case r=3. EOS We prove in that case that if f(z)=z^ p, where p is an integer, p not equal to 0,1,2, or 3, then P_ b -P_ a has non-real roots with real part strictly between a and b for any 0<a<b.	This defines a countable family of means.

doc	Influence of a magnetic guide field on wakefield acceleration EOS Enhancement of the trapping and optimization of the beam quality are two key issues of Laser Wake Field Acceleration (LWFA). EOS The influence of stochastic acceleration on the trapping of electrons is compared to the one of cold injection. EOS It is shown that when considering a high intensity wave perturbed by a low intensity counter-propagating wave, in the non-linear blowout regime, the influence of the colliding pulses polarizations (either parallel linear or positive circular) on the beam quality seems weak when the electron density is below _EQN_ critical density. EOS The effect of a homogenous constant magnetic field _EQN_, parallel to the direction of propagation of the pump pulse, is studied in the blowout regime.	Transverse currents are generated at the rim of the bubble, which results in the amplification of the _EQN_ field at the rear of the bubble.
doc	From harmonic maps to the nonlinear supersymmetric sigma model of quantum field theory. At the interface of theoretical physics, Riemannian geometry and nonlinear analysis EOS Harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces arise from a conformally invariant variational problem. EOS Therefore, on one hand, they are intimately connected with moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and on the other hand, because the conformal group is noncompact, constitute a prototype for the formation of singularities, the so-called bubbles, in geometric analysis. EOS In theoretical physics, they arise from the nonlinear _EQN_ -model of quantum field theory. EOS That model possesses a supersymmetric extension, coupling a harmonic map like field with a nonlinear spinor field.	In the physical model, that spinor field is anticommuting.

doc	Personalized PageRank to a Target Node, Revisited EOS Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a widely used node proximity measure in graph mining and network analysis. EOS Given a source node _EQN_ and a target node _EQN_, the PPR value _EQN_ represents the probability that a random walk from _EQN_ terminates at _EQN_, and thus indicates the bidirectional importance between _EQN_ and _EQN_.	The majority of the existing work focuses on the single-source queries, which asks for the PPR value of a given source node _EQN_ and every node _EQN_.

The results have implications for spin-coupled magnetoresistance in ferromagnet/superconductor contacts and for measuring spin polarization in ferromagnets.
doc	Recent Advances in Convolutional Neural Network Acceleration EOS In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great performance in various fields such as image classification, pattern recognition, and multi-media compression. EOS Two of the feature properties, local connectivity and weight sharing, can reduce the number of parameters and increase processing speed during training and inference. EOS However, as the dimension of data becomes higher and the CNN architecture becomes more complicated, the end-to-end approach or the combined manner of CNN is computationally intensive, which becomes limitation to CNN's further implementation. EOS Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to implement CNN in a faster way. EOS In this paper, we first summarize the acceleration methods that contribute to but not limited to CNN by reviewing a broad variety of research papers. EOS We propose a taxonomy in terms of three levels, i.e.~structure level, algorithm level, and implementation level, for acceleration methods. EOS We also analyze the acceleration methods in terms of CNN architecture compression, algorithm optimization, and hardware-based improvement.	At last, we give a discussion on different perspectives of these acceleration and optimization methods within each level.

EOS Our aim is to spatially resolve the stellar surface of HD 208472 and relate the photometric results to the true longitudinal and latitudinal spot appearance. EOS Furthermore, we investigate the surface differential rotation pattern of the star.

EOS In image classification, an adversarial example is a carefully modified image that is visually imperceptible to the original image but can cause DNN model to misclassify it. EOS Training the network with Gaussian noise is an effective technique to perform model regularization, thus improving model robustness against input variation. EOS Inspired by this classical method, we explore to utilize the regularization characteristic of noise injection to improve DNN's robustness against adversarial attack.	In this work, we propose Parametric-Noise-Injection (PNI) which involves trainable Gaussian noise injection at each layer on either activation or weights through solving the min-max optimization problem, embedded with adversarial training.
doc	Elliptical galaxies with rapidly decreasing velocity dispersion profiles: NMAGIC models and dark halo parameter estimates for NGC 4494 EOS NGC 4494 is one of several intermediate-luminosity elliptical galaxies inferred to have an unusually diffuse dark matter halo. EOS We use the chi^2-made-to-measure particle code NMAGIC to construct axisymmetric models of NGC 4494 from photometric and various kinematic data.	The extended kinematics include light spectra in multiple slitlets out to 3.5 R_e, and hundreds of planetary nebulae velocities out to ~7 R_e, thus allowing us to probe the dark matter content and orbital structure in the halo.
doc	The Formation Epoch of Early-Type Galaxies in the z ~ 0.9 CL1604 Supercluster EOS We analyse the cluster color-magnitude relation (CMR) for early-type galaxies in two of the richer clusters in the z ~ 0.9 supercluster system to derive average ages and formation redshifts for the early-type galaxy population. EOS Both clusters were observed with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope through the F606W and F814W filters, which brackets the rest-frame 4000 \AA break at the cluster redshifts of z\sim 0.9. EOS We fit the zeropoint and slope of the red cluster sequence, and model the scatter about this relation to estimate average galaxy ages and formation redshifts.	We find intrinsic scatters of 0.038-0.053 mag in (_EQN_) for the E and E+S0 populations, corresponding to average ages of 3.5-3.7 Gyr and formation redshifts z_ f =2.4-2.6.
doc	The effect of helicity on the correlation time of large scale turbulent flows EOS Solutions of the forced Navier-Stokes equation have been conjectured to thermalize at scales larger than the forcing scale, similar to an absolute equilibrium obtained for the spectrally-truncated Euler equation. EOS Using direct numeric simulations of Taylor-Green flows and general-periodic helical flows, we present results on the probability density function, energy spectrum, auto-correlation function and correlation time that compare the two systems. EOS In the case of highly helical flows, we derive an analytic expression describing the correlation time for the absolute equilibrium of helical flows that is different from the _EQN_ -scaling law of weakly helical flows. EOS This model predicts a new helicity-based scaling law for the correlation time as _EQN_. EOS This scaling law is verified in simulations of the truncated Euler equation.	In simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations the large scale modes of forced Taylor-Green symmetric flows (with zero total helicity and large separation of scales) follow the same properties as absolute equilibrium including a _EQN_ scaling for the correlation time.

doc	The course of the Orphan Stream in the Northern Galactic Hemisphere traced with Gaia DR2 EOS The Orphan Stream is one of the most prominent tidal streams in the Galactic halo. EOS Using data on red giants, RR Lyrae, and horizontal branch stars from Gaia and other surveys, we determine the proper motion of the Orphan Stream over a path of more than 90 degrees on the sky. EOS We also provide updated tracks for the sky position, distance, and radial velocity of the stream. EOS Our tracks in these latter dimensions mostly agree with previous results.	However, there are significant corrections to the earlier distance and latitude tracks as the stream approaches the Galactic disk.
doc	Ion acceleration during internal magnetic reconnection events in TST-2 EOS Characteristics of ion acceleration in the internal magnetic reconnection events (IRE) have been studied by means of a neutral particle energy analyzer (NPA) in Tokyo Spherical Tokamak (TST-2). EOS The major and minor radii are 0.38 m and 0.25m, respectively. EOS The magnetic field strength is 0.3T and the maximum plasma current is up to 140 kA. EOS The electron and ion temperatures are 0.4-0.5 keV and 0.1 keV, respectively and the electron density is ~1x1019 m-3. EOS The NPA can be scanned toroidally from q = 74&deg; EOS (cw) to q = 114&deg; EOS (ccw), where q = 90&deg; EOS corresponds to the perpendicular sightline. EOS The direction of the plasma current is cw. EOS The NPA signals are digitized at every 50 ms. EOS The NPA is calibrated in the energy range of 0.1 keV < E < 8.4 keV. EOS When the IRE occurs, it is observed that the plasma current increases by ~ 20% and the loop voltage drops from 0.6 V to-5 V for ~ 0.1 ms. EOS The enhanced charge exchange flux is observed by more than one order of magnitude at ~ 1 keV for this reconnection phase.	The ion temperature increases by 80 eV at IREs.
doc	Boolean Compressed Sensing and Noisy Group Testing EOS The fundamental task of group testing is to recover a small distinguished subset of items from a large population while efficiently reducing the total number of tests (measurements). EOS The key contribution of this paper is in adopting a new information-theoretic perspective on group testing problems. EOS We formulate the group testing problem as a channel coding/decoding problem and derive a single-letter characterization for the total number of tests used to identify the defective set. EOS Although the focus of this paper is primarily on group testing, our main result is generally applicable to other compressive sensing models.	The single letter characterization is shown to be order-wise tight for many interesting noisy group testing scenarios.
doc	A Spectroscopic Survey of X-ray Selected AGN in the Northern XMM-XXL Field EOS This paper presents a survey of X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) with optical spectroscopic follow-up in a _EQN_ area of the equatorial XMM-XXL north field. EOS A sample of 8445 point-like X-ray sources detected by XMM-Newton above a limiting flux of _EQN_ was matched to optical (SDSS) and infrared (WISE) counterparts. EOS We followed up 3042 sources brighter than _EQN_ mag with the SDSS BOSS spectrograph. EOS The spectra yielded a reliable redshift measurement for 2578 AGN in the redshift range _EQN_, with _EQN_ luminosities ranging from _EQN_. EOS This is currently the largest published spectroscopic sample of X-ray selected AGN in a contiguous area. EOS The BOSS spectra of AGN candidates show a bimodal distribution of optical line widths allowing a separation between broad- and narrow-emission line AGN. EOS The former dominate our sample (70 per cent) due to the relatively bright X-ray flux limit and the optical BOSS magnitude limit. EOS We classify the narrow emission line objects (22 per cent of full sample) using standard BPT diagnostics: the majority have line ratios indicating the dominant source of ionization is the AGN.	A small number (8 per cent of full sample) exhibit the typical narrow line ratios of star-forming galaxies, or only have absorption lines in their spectra.
doc	Concurrent and Adaptive Extreme Scale Binding Free Energy Calculations EOS The efficacy of drug treatments depends on how tightly small molecules bind to their target proteins. EOS The rapid and accurate quantification of the strength of these interactions (as measured by binding affinity) is a grand challenge of computational chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the platform for patient-specific medicine. EOS Recent evidence suggests that molecular dynamics (MD) can achieve useful predictive accuracy (< 1 kcal/mol). EOS For this predictive accuracy to impact clinical decision making, binding free energy computational campaigns must provide results rapidly and without loss of accuracy. EOS This demands advances in algorithms, scalable software systems, and efficient utilization of supercomputing resources. EOS We introduce a framework called HTBAC, designed to support accurate and scalable drug binding affinity calculations, while marshaling large simulation campaigns. EOS We show that HTBAC supports the specification and execution of free-energy protocols at scale. EOS This paper makes three main contributions: (1) shows the importance of adaptive execution for ensemble-based free energy protocols to improve binding affinity accuracy; EOS (2) presents and characterizes HTBAC -- a software system that enables the scalable and adaptive execution of binding affinity protocols at scale;	and (3) for a widely used free-energy protocol (TIES), shows improvements in the accuracy of simulations for a fixed amount of resource, or reduced resource consumption for a fixed accuracy as a consequence of adaptive execution.
doc	Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect and Anderson Chern Insulating Regime in Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic 3Q State EOS We investigate the emergence of both quantum anomalous Hall and disorder-induced Anderson Chern insulating phases in two dimensional hexagonal lattices, with antiferromagnetically ordered 3Q state and in the absence of spin-orbit coupling.	Using tight-binding modeling, we show that such systems display not only a spin-polarized edge-localized current, the chirality of which is energy dependent but also an impurity-induced transition from trivial metallic to topological insulating regimes, through one edge mode plateau.
doc	Lessons from a Large-Scale Assessment: Results from Conceptual Inventories EOS We report the conceptual inventory results of a large-scale assessment project at a large university. EOS We studied an attempt at introducing materials and instructional methods informed by physics education research (PER-informed materials) into a department where most instruction has been traditional and a significant number of faculty are hesitant, ambivalent or even resistant about the introduction of such reforms. EOS The changes were made in the laboratories and recitation sections of the introductory classes, both calculus-based and algebra-based, introducing PER-informed materials and training the teaching assistants in student-centered instructional methods. EOS In addition to the results found in the large lecture classes, we present the results of a small PER-informed, inquiry-based, laboratory-based class that has been taught as a special section of the algebra-based course for about 10 years. EOS The assessment reported in this paper was done using available PER-developed assessment instruments. EOS The results of other assessment instruments used in the project, such as free-response pre- and post-tests, are reported in subsequent papers. EOS The results in this paper inform researchers in PER of the use of PER-informed materials and instructional methods in a department not unified in the introduction and implementation of these materials and the results of the implementation as assessed by PER-based conceptual inventories. EOS We found that our conceptual inventory scores were lower than many results reported elsewhere in the literature.	However, we did see a statistically significant increase in the conceptual inventory scores with the implementation of PER-informed laboratories and the use of student-centered pedagogy in the labs and recitations.

EOS Zeroing neural networks (ZNN) were invented 20 years ago in China and almost all of their advances have been made in and still come from its birthplace.	ZNN methods have become a backbone for solving discretized sensor driven time-varying matrix problems in real-time, in theory and in on-chip applications for robots, in control theory and engineering in general.
doc	Universal intrinsic higher-rank spin Hall effect EOS Spin Hall effect (SHE), a fundamental transport phenomenon with non-zero spin current but vanishing charge current, has important applications in spintronics for the electrical control of spins. EOS Owing to the half-spin nature of electrons, the rank of spin current (determined by the rank of spin tensor) has been restricted to 0 and 1 for charge and spin Hall effects.	Motivated by recent studies of pseudospin-1 fermions in solid state and cold atomic systems, here we introduce and characterize higher-rank (_EQN_) SHEs in large spin (_EQN_) systems.
doc	On one-dimension semi-linear wave equations with null conditions EOS It is well-known that in dimensions at least three semilinear wave equations with null conditions admit global solutions for small initial data.

EOS The proofs are based on the decay mechanism of linear waves.	However, in one dimension, waves do not decay.
doc	Learning a Directional Soft Lane Affordance Model for Road Scenes Using Self-Supervision EOS Humans navigate complex environments in an organized yet flexible manner, adapting to the context and implicit social rules. EOS Understanding these naturally learned patterns of behavior is essential for applications such as autonomous vehicles. EOS However, algorithmically defining these implicit rules of human behavior remains difficult. EOS This work proposes a novel self-supervised method for training a probabilistic network model to estimate the regions humans are most likely to drive in as well as a multimodal representation of the inferred direction of travel at each point. EOS The model is trained on individual human trajectories conditioned on a representation of the driving environment.	The model is shown to successfully generalize to new road scenes, demonstrating potential for real-world application as a prior for socially acceptable driving behavior in challenging or ambiguous scenarios which are poorly handled by explicit traffic rules.
doc	A proof of the Kuramoto conjecture for a bifurcation structure of the infinite dimensional Kuramoto model EOS The Kuramoto model is a system of ordinary differential equations for describing synchronization phenomena defined as a coupled phase oscillators. EOS In this paper, a bifurcation structure of the infinite dimensional Kuramoto model is investigated. EOS For a certain non-selfadjoint linear operator, which defines a linear part of the Kuramoto model, the spectral theory on a space of generalized functions is developed with the aid of a rigged Hilbert space to avoid a continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. EOS Although the linear operator has an unbounded continuous spectrum on a Hilbert space, it is shown that it admits a spectral decomposition consisting of a countable number of eigenfunctions on a space of generalized functions. EOS The semigroup generated by the linear operator is calculated by using the spectral decomposition to prove the linear stability of a steady state of the system. EOS The center manifold theory is also developed on a space of generalized functions.	It is proved that there exists a finite dimensional center manifold on a space of generalized functions, while a center manifold on a Hilbert space is of infinite dimensional because of the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis.

They found a certain pattern of degeneracies and linked it to the sl(2)-loop symmetry present in the commensurable spin sector (N divides S^z).
doc	Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation of Organs at Risk on 3D Pelvic CT Images EOS Automated segmentation of organs-at-risk in pelvic computed tomography (CT) images can assist the radiotherapy treatment planning by saving time and effort of manual contouring and reducing intra-observer and inter-observer variation. EOS However, training high-performance deep-learning segmentation models usually requires broad labeled data, which are labor-intensive to collect. EOS Lack of annotated data presents a significant challenge for many medical imaging-related deep learning solutions. EOS This paper proposes a novel end-to-end convolutional neural network-based semi-supervised adversarial method that can segment multiple organs-at-risk, including prostate, bladder, rectum, left femur, and right femur.	New design schemes are introduced to enhance the baseline residual U-net architecture to improve performance.
doc	A Millimetre Survey of Starburst Dominated Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies at z~2 EOS We present millimetre observations of a sample of 12 high redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) in the Extended Growth Strip (EGS). EOS These objects were initially selected on the basis of their observed mid--IR colours (0.0 < [3.6]-[4.5] < 0.4 and -0.7 < [3.6]-[8.0] < 0.5) to lie at high redshift 1.5 < z < 3, and subsequent 20-38 micron mid-IR spectroscopy confirms that they lie in a narrow redshift window centered on z=2. EOS We detect 9/12 of the objects in our sample at high significance (>3 sigma) with a mean 1200\micron flux of <F_1200> = 1.6+/-0.1 mJy. EOS Our millimetre photometry, combined with existing far-IR photometry from the Far-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy (FIDEL) Survey and accurate spectroscopic redshifts, places constraints both sides of the thermal dust peak. EOS This allows us to estimate the dust properties, including the far--IR luminosity, dust temperature, and dust mass. EOS We find that our sample is similar to other high-z and intermediate-z ULIRGs, and local systems, but has a different dust selection function than submillimeter-selected galaxies.	Finally, we use existing 20cm radio continuum imaging to test the far-IR/radio correlation at high redshift.
doc	Feasibility of Direct Disposal of Salt Waste from Electochemical Processing of Spent Nuclear Fuel EOS The US Department of Energy decided in 2000 to treat its sodium-bonded spent nuclear fuel, produced for experiments on breeder reactors, with an electrochemical process. EOS The metallic waste produced is to be cast into ingots and the salt waste further processed to form a ceramic waste form for disposal in a mined repository.	However, alternative disposal pathways for metallic and salt waste streams are being investigated that may reduce the processing complexity.
doc	An Industrial Case Study on Shrinking Code Review Changesets through Remark Prediction EOS Change-based code review is used widely in industrial software development. EOS Thus, research on tools that help the reviewer to achieve better review performance can have a high impact. EOS We analyze one possibility to provide cognitive support for the reviewer: Determining the importance of change parts for review, specifically determining which parts of the code change can be left out from the review without harm.	To determine the importance of change parts, we extract data from software repositories and build prediction models for review remarks based on this data.
doc	The HI supershell GS061+00+51 and its neighbours EOS We describe HI observations of a 4 x 4 degrees field in the Milky Way centered on l=61 deg, b=0 deg made by the Effelsberg radiotelescope. EOS The field contains one previously identified HI supershell, GS061+00+51 (Heiles, 1979); EOS apart from it we find several new structures. EOS We also study the HI distribution in the vicinity of four HII regions, S86, S87, S88 and S89. EOS We confirm the existence of the shell GS061+00+51, and we find that it has two smaller neighbours, spherical shells with a radius around 30 pc.	We identify at least one more regular shell at v_LSR = -18 km/s;

doc	Two Growing Modes and the Morphology-Quiescence Relation in Galaxies EOS Quiescence in galaxies correlates strongly with the central density/morphology of the stellar distribution. EOS We investigate two possible explanations for this morphology-quiescence relation: 1) the central density results from a dissipative core-building event ("compaction") that feeds an AGN that quenches the galaxy and 2) the central density results from inside-out growth by galaxy-wide star formation that is quenched by processes unrelated to the central density.	We aim to distinguish these two scenarios using the MaNGA survey to determine profiles of stellar age, specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas phase metallicity (O/H) as a function of stellar mass surface density within 1 kpc (Sigma_1kpc) and total stellar mass (M*).
doc	Understanding Divergent Thermal Conductivity in Single Polythiophene Chains using Modal Analysis and Sonification EOS We used molecular dynamics simulations, the Green-Kubo Modal Analysis (GKMA) method and sonification to study the modal contributions to thermal conductivity in individual polythiophene chains. EOS The simulations suggest that it is possible to achieve divergent thermal conductivity and the GKMA method allowed for exact pinpointing of the modes responsible for the anomalous behavior. EOS The analysis showed that transverse vibrations in the plane of the aromatic rings at low frequencies ~ 0.05 THz are primarily responsible.	Further investigation showed that the divergence arises from persistent correlation between the three lowest frequency modes on chains.
doc	The _EQN_ infrared spectrograph survey of protoplanetary disks in Orion A: I. disk properties EOS We present our investigation of 319 Class II objects in Orion A observed by _EQN_ /IRS. EOS We also present the follow-up observation of 120 of these Class II objects in Orion A from IRTF/SpeX. EOS We measure continuum spectral indices, equivalent widths, and integrated fluxes that pertain to disk structure and dust composition from IRS spectra of Class II objects in Orion A. EOS We estimate mass accretion rates using hydrogen recombination lines in the SpeX spectra of our targets.	Utilizing these properties, we compare the distributions of the disk and dust properties of Orion A disks to those of Taurus disks with respect to position within Orion A (ONC and L1641) and to the sub-groups by the inferred radial structures, such as transitional disks vs.

EOS ANITA searches for impulsive coherent radio Cherenkov emission from 200 to 1200 MHz, arising from the Askaryan charge excess in ultra-high energy neutrino-induced cascades within Antarctic ice.	This flight included significant improvements over the first flight in the payload sensitivity, efficiency, and a flight trajectory over deeper ice.
doc	Jupiter's composition suggests its core assembled exterior to the N2 snowline EOS Jupiter's atmosphere is enriched in C, N, S, P, Ar, Kr and Xe with respect to solar abundances by a factor of ~3. EOS Gas Giant envelopes are mainly enriched through the dissolution of solids in the atmosphere, and this constant enrichment factor is puzzling since several of the above elements are not expected to have been in the solid phase in Jupiter's feeding zone; EOS most seriously, Ar and the main carrier of N, N2, only condense at the very low temperatures, 21-26 K, associated with the outer solar nebula.	We propose that a plausible solution to the enigma of Jupiter's uniform enrichment pattern is that Jupiter's core formed exterior to the N2 and Ar snowlines, beyond 30 au, resulting in a Solar composition core in all volatiles heavier than Ne.
doc	Curing Braess' Paradox by Secondary Control in Power Grids EOS Robust operation of power transmission grids is essential for most of today's technical infrastructure and our daily life. EOS Adding renewable generation to power grids requires grid extensions and sophisticated control actions on different time scales to cope with short-term fluctuations and long-term power imbalance. EOS Braess' paradox constitutes a counterintuitive collective phenomenon that occurs if adding new transmission line capacity to a network increases loads on other lines, effectively reducing the system's performance and potentially even entirely removing its operating state.	Combining simple analytical considerations with numerical investigations on a small sample network, we here study dynamical consequences of secondary control in AC power grid models.
doc	Fluctuation theory and exit systems for positive self-similar Markov processes EOS For a positive self-similar Markov process, X, we construct a local time for the random set, _EQN_, of times where the process reaches its past supremum. EOS Using this local time we describe an exit system for the excursions of X out of its past supremum. EOS Next, we define and study the ladder process (R,H) associated to a positive self-similar Markov process X, namely a bivariate Markov process with a scaling property whose coordinates are the right inverse of the local time of the random set _EQN_ and the process X sampled on the local time scale.	The process (R,H) is described in terms of a ladder process linked to the L\' e vy process associated to X via Lamperti's transformation.

Our proof involves finding an exact formula for the number of _EQN_ -rational points on _EQN_ for all _EQN_, and uses a result we proved elsewhere about the number of rational points on supersingular curves.

EOS The eastern filament (F1) first erupted toward the northeast.	During the eruption of F1, some plasma from F1 fell down and was injected to the North-East part of another filament (F2), and some plasma of F1 fell down to the northern region close to F2 and caused the plasma to brighten.

doc	Overview and Issues of Experimental Observation of Microbunching Instabilities EOS The generation of the ultra-bright beams required by modern accelerators and drivers of free-electron lasers (FELs) has generally relied on chicane-based bunch compressions that often result in the microbunching instability. EOS Following compression, spectral enhancements extend even into the visible wavelengths through the longitudinal space charge (LSC) impedances. EOS Optical transition radiation (OTR) screens have been extensively used for transverse electron beam size measurements for the bright beams, but the presence of such longitudinal microstructures (microbunching) in the electron beam or the leading edge spikes can result in strong, localized coherent enhancements (COTR) that mask the actual beam profile. EOS Generally, we have observed effects in rf photocathode (PC) injected linacs with chicane compressions since an R56 term is needed. EOS In the past COTR had been only reported in S-band and L-band photoinjected based linacs with single or double bunch compression. EOS Drive laser modulations and charge shot noise have been suspected of contributing to the cause. EOS We now have evidence for the effects in both rf PC-gun injected linacs and thermionic- cathode (TC)-gun injected linacs (the latter do not involve a drive laser). EOS Since the first observations, significant efforts have been made to characterize, model, and mitigate COTR effects on beam diagnostics.	An update on the state-of-the-art for diagnosing these effects will be given as illustrated by examples at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), Spring-8 Compact SASE Source (SCSS), Spring-8 Angstrom Compact Free Electron LAser (SACLA), Advanced Photon Source (APS), and the Next Linear Collider Test Accelerator (NLCTA).
doc	Vortices and Vermas EOS In three-dimensional gauge theories, monopole operators create and destroy vortices. EOS We explore this idea in the context of 3d N=4 gauge theories in the presence of an Omega-background. EOS In this case, monopole operators generate a non-commutative algebra that quantizes the Coulomb-branch chiral ring. EOS The monopole operators act naturally on a Hilbert space, which is realized concretely as the equivariant cohomology of a moduli space of vortices. EOS The action furnishes the space with the structure of a Verma module for the Coulomb-branch algebra. EOS This leads to a new mathematical definition of the Coulomb-branch algebra itself, related to that of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima.	By introducing additional boundary conditions, we find a construction of vortex partition functions of 2d N=(2,2) theories as overlaps of coherent states (Whittaker vectors) for Coulomb-branch algebras, generalizing work of Braverman-Feigin-Finkelberg-Rybnikov on a finite version of the AGT correspondence.
doc	Molecular Gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA): IX. The decoupled bars and gas inflow in NGC 2782 EOS We present CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) maps of the starburst/Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 2782, obtained with the IRAM interferometer. EOS The CO emission is aligned along the stellar nuclear bar of radius 1 kpc, configured in an elongated structure with two spiral arms at high pitch angle. EOS At the extremity of the nuclear bar, the CO changes direction to trace two more extended spiral features at a lower pitch angle. EOS These are the beginning of two straight dust lanes, which are aligned parallel to an oval distortion, reminiscent of a primary bar, almost perpendicular to the nuclear one.	The two embedded bars appear in Spitzer IRAC near-infrared images, and HST color images, although highly obscured by dust in the latter.

doc	Photon-momentum transfer in diatomic molecules: an ab initio study EOS For a molecule, the two-center interference and the molecular scattering phase of the electron are important for almost all the processes that may occur in a laser field. EOS In this study, we investigate their effects in the transfer of linear photon momentum to the ionized electron by absorbing a single photon. EOS The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation of H _EQN_ is numerically solved in the multipolar gauge in which the electric quadrupole term and the magnetic dipole term are explicitly expressed. EOS This allows us to separate the contributions of the two terms in the momentum transfer. EOS For different configurations of the molecular and the laser orientation, the transferred momentum to the electron is evaluated at different internuclear distances with various photon energies and two-center interferences are identified in the whole region. EOS At small electron energies and small internuclear distances, we find significant deviations from the prediction of the classical double-slit model due to the strong mediation of the Coulomb potential.	Finally, even for a large internuclear distance, our results show that a varying molecular scattering phase is important at all electron energies, which is beyond the simple prediction of the linear combination of the atomical orbitals.
doc	Supersymmetry of the 2+1 black holes EOS The supersymmetry properties of the asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes of Einstein theory in 2+1 dimensions are investigated. EOS It is shown that (i) the zero mass black hole has two exact super- symmetries; EOS (ii) extreme _EQN_ black holes with _EQN_ have only one; EOS and (iii) generic black holes do not have any.	It is also argued that the zero mass hole is the ground state of (1,1)-adS supergravity with periodic (``Ramond") boundary conditions on the spinor fields.

We describe a principled methodology to solicit dictionary features from a teacher, and present results showing that models built using these human-comprehensible features are competitive with models trained with Bag of Words features.
doc	Recursive regularization step for high-order lattice Boltzmann methods EOS A lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with enhanced stability and accuracy is presented for various Hermite tensor-based lattice structures. EOS The collision operator relies on a regularization step, which is here improved through a recursive computation of non-equilibrium Hermite polynomial coefficients. EOS In addition to the reduced computational cost of this procedure with respect to the standard one, the recursive step allows to considerably enhance the stability and accuracy of the numerical scheme by properly filtering out second (and higher) order non-hydrodynamic contributions in under-resolved conditions. EOS This is first shown in the isothermal case where the simulation of the doubly periodic shear layer is performed with a Reynolds number ranging from _EQN_ to _EQN_, and where a thorough analysis of the case at _EQN_ is conducted.	In the latter, results obtained using both regularization steps are compared against the BGK-LBM for standard (D2Q9) and high-order (D2V17 and D2V37) lattice structures, confirming the tremendous increase of stability range of the proposed approach.
doc	Gated-GAN: Adversarial Gated Networks for Multi-Collection Style Transfer EOS Style transfer describes the rendering of an image semantic content as different artistic styles. EOS Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have emerged as an effective approach in style transfer by adversarially training the generator to synthesize convincing counterfeits. EOS However, traditional GAN suffers from the mode collapse issue, resulting in unstable training and making style transfer quality difficult to guarantee. EOS In addition, the GAN generator is only compatible with one style, so a series of GANs must be trained to provide users with choices to transfer more than one kind of style. EOS In this paper, we focus on tackling these challenges and limitations to improve style transfer.	We propose adversarial gated networks (Gated GAN) to transfer multiple styles in a single model.
doc	Iwasawa theory for _EQN_, Bloch-Kato conjecture and Functional Equation EOS In this paper we develop a new method to study Iwasawa theory and Eisenstein families for unitary groups _EQN_ of general signature over a totally real field _EQN_. EOS As a consequence we prove that for a motive corresponding to a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representation _EQN_ on _EQN_ which is ordinary at _EQN_, twisted by a Hecke character, if its Selmer group has rank _EQN_, then the corresponding central _EQN_ -value is nonzero.	This generalizes a result of Skinner-Urban in their ICM 2006 report in the special case when _EQN_ and the motive is conjugate self-dual.
doc	Three-Dimensional Simulations of Mixing Instabilities in Supernova Explosions EOS We present the first three-dimensional (3D) simulations of the large-scale mixing that takes place in the shock-heated stellar layers ejected in the explosion of a 15.5 solar-mass blue supergiant star. EOS The outgoing supernova shock is followed from its launch by neutrino heating until it breaks out from the stellar surface more than two hours after the core collapse. EOS Violent convective overturn in the post-shock layer causes the explosion to start with significant asphericity, which triggers the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities at the composition interfaces of the exploding star. EOS Deep inward mixing of hydrogen (H) is found as well as fast-moving, metal-rich clumps penetrating with high velocities far into the H-envelope of the star as observed, e.g., in the case of SN 1987A.	Also individual clumps containing a sizeable fraction of the ejected iron-group elements (up to several 0.001 solar masses) are obtained in some models.

doc	Higher-order local and non-local correlations for 1D strongly interacting Bose gas EOS The correlation function is an important quantity in the physics of ultracold quantum gases because it provides information about the quantum many-body wave function beyond the simple density profile. EOS In this paper we first study the _EQN_ -body local correlation functions, _EQN_, of the one-dimensional (1D) strongly repulsive Bose gas within the Lieb-Liniger model using the analytical method proposed by Gangardt and Shlyapnikov [1,2]. EOS In the strong repulsion regime the 1D Bose gas at low temperatures is equivalent to a gas of ideal particles obeying the non-mutual generalized exclusion statistics (GES) with a statistical parameter _EQN_, i.e.	the quasimomenta of _EQN_ strongly interacting bosons map to the momenta of _EQN_ free fermions via _EQN_ with _EQN_.
doc	Evaluation of linear classifiers on articles containing pharmacokinetic evidence of drug-drug interactions EOS Background. EOS Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. EOS [...] Biomedical literature mining can aid DDI research by extracting relevant DDI signals from either the published literature or large clinical databases. EOS However, though drug interaction is an ideal area for translational research, the inclusion of literature mining methodologies in DDI workflows is still very preliminary. EOS One area that can benefit from literature mining is the automatic identification of a large number of potential DDIs, whose pharmacological mechanisms and clinical significance can then be studied via in vitro pharmacology and in populo pharmaco-epidemiology. EOS Experiments. EOS We implemented a set of classifiers for identifying published articles relevant to experimental pharmacokinetic DDI evidence.	These documents are important for identifying causal mechanisms behind putative drug-drug interactions, an important step in the extraction of large numbers of potential DDIs.
doc	Galactocentric variation of the gas-to-dust ratio and its relation with metallicity EOS (Abridged) Context: The assumption of a gas-to-dust mass ratio (\gamma) is a common approach to estimate the basic properties of molecular clouds, such as total mass and column density of molecular hydrogen, from (sub)mm continuum observations of the dust. EOS In the Milky Way a single value is used at all galactocentric radii, independently of the observed metallicity gradients. EOS Both models and extragalactic observations suggest that this quantity increases for decreasing metallicity Z, typical of the outer regions in disks, where fewer heavy elements are available to form dust grains. EOS Aims: We aim to investigate the variation of the gas-to-dust ratio as a function of galactocentric radius and metallicity, to allow a more accurate characterisation of the quantity of molecular gas across the galactic disk, as derived from observations of the dust. EOS Methods: Observations of the optically thin C\ _EQN_ O (2-1) transition were obtained with the APEX telescope for a sample of 23 massive and dense star-forming regions in the far outer Galaxy (galactocentric distance greater than 14 kpc). EOS From the modelling of this line and of the spectral energy distribution of the selected clumps we computed the gas-to-dust ratio and compared it to that of well-studied sources from the ATLASGAL TOP100 sample in the inner galactic disk.	Results: The gradient in gas-to-dust ratio is found to be 0.087 dex/kpc (or equivalently \gamma\ proportional to Z\ _EQN_).
doc	Pulsed-laser epitaxy of metallic delafossite PdCrO _EQN_ films EOS Alternate stacking of a highly conducting metallic layer with a magnetic triangular layer found in delafossite PdCrO2 provides an excellent platform for discovering intriguing correlated quantum phenomena. EOS Thin film growth of the material may enable not only tuning the basic physical properties beyond what bulk materials can exhibit, but also developing novel hybrid materials by interfacing with dissimilar materials, yet this has proven to be extremely challenging. EOS Here, we report the epitaxial growth of metallic delafossite PdCrO2 films by pulsed laser epitaxy (PLE). EOS The fundamental role of the PLE growth conditions, epitaxial strain, and chemical and structural characteristics of the substrate is investigated by growing under various growth conditions and on various types of substrates.	While strain plays a large role in improving the crystallinities, the direct growth of epitaxial PdCrO2 films without impurity phases was not successful.
doc	Cold Gas Kinematics in an L* Spiral Galaxy at z=0.437: The Nature of Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers EOS Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope observations of the redshifted 21cm line absorber against the z_em = 0.871 double lobed quasar 3C196 show that the intervening absorber is an L approximately equal L* spiral galaxy (3C196-G1) and that the absorbing layer of cold gas extends to radii of at least 30 h_50^-1 kpc.	The new data solve several long standing puzzles about this system by (1) discovering a second 21cm absorption feature, corresponding to absorption against the NE lobe of the background radio source and (2) spatially ``resolving'' the two absorption features to isolate the absorption along the two lines of sight to the opposing radio lobes.
doc	The number of openly generated Boolean algebras EOS This article is devoted to two different generalizations of projective Boolean algebras: openly generated Boolean algebras and tightly sigma-filtered Boolean algebras. EOS We show that for every uncountable regular cardinal kappa there are 2^kappa pairwise non-isomorphic openly generated Boolean algebras of size kappa > aleph_1 provided there is an almost free non-free abelian group of size kappa. EOS The openly generated Boolean algebras constructed here are almost free.	Moreover, for every infinite regular cardinal kappa we construct 2^kappa pairwise non-isomorphic Boolean algebras of size kappa that are tightly sigma-filtered and c.c.c.

EOS They contribute to the improvement of coherence time and qubit-phase accumulation due to a time-varying field and can thus achieve high-frequency-resolution spectroscopy. EOS Such behaviors find useful application in highly sensitive detection based on qubits for various external fields such as a magnetic field.	Hence, decoupling sequences are indispensable tools for quantum sensing.

EOS In epitaxial quantum dots formed on a substrate, band-edge diagrams sound to more complex than simple bulk materials because of the important role of strain. EOS Strain tensor is strongly dependent to lattice mismatch. EOS Various substrate indexes have been used in the laser devices, and a number of research groups elaborate to find the best substrate index. EOS In this research band edge, energy levels and strain effects of cubic In_0.4 Ga_0.6 As-GaAs quantum dots are studied by 6-band k.p model and their dependence to substrate index is investigated. EOS It is shown that change of substrate index affects the band gap and transition energy of electrons and holes. EOS Moreover, we show that components of strain tensor are strongly sensitive to surface index, and symmetry breaks along space.	Our results appear to be in very good consonance with represented formula and similar researches.
doc	Cancer classification and pathway discovery using non-negative matrix factorization EOS Extracting genetic information from a full range of sequencing data is important for understanding diseases. EOS We propose a novel method to effectively explore the landscape of genetic mutations and aggregate them to predict cancer type. EOS We used multinomial logistic regression, nonsmooth non-negative matrix factorization (nsNMF), and support vector machine (SVM) to utilize the full range of sequencing data, aiming at better aggregating genetic mutations and improving their power in predicting cancer types. EOS Specifically, we introduced a classifier to distinguish cancer types using somatic mutations obtained from whole-exome sequencing data. EOS Mutations were identified from multiple cancers and scored using SIFT, PP2, and CADD, and grouped at the individual gene level. EOS The nsNMF was then applied to reduce dimensionality and to obtain coefficient and basis matrices.	A feature matrix was derived from the obtained matrices to train a classifier for cancer type classification with the SVM model.
doc	Towards testing the unitarity of the 3X3 lepton flavor mixing matrix in a precision reactor antineutrino oscillation experiment EOS The 3X3 Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata-Pontecorvo (MNSP) lepton flavor mixing matrix may be slightly non-unitary if the three active neutrinos are coupled with sterile neutrinos. EOS We show that it is in principle possible to test whether the relation |V_ e1 |^2 + |V_ e2 |^2 + |V_ e3 |^2 = 1 holds or not in a precision reactor antineutrino oscillation experiment, such as the recently proposed Daya Bay II experiment. EOS We explore three categories of non-unitary effects on the 3X3 MNSP matrix: 1) the indirect effect in the (3+ 3) flavor mixing scenario where the three heavy sterile neutrinos do not take part in neutrino oscillations; EOS 2) the direct effect in the (3+\mathbbm 1) scenario where the light sterile neutrino can oscillate into the active ones;	and 3) the interplay of both of them in the (3+\mathbbm 1 + 2) scenario.

doc	Dynamics of compressional Mach cones in a strongly coupled complex plasma EOS Using a Generalised-Hydrodynamic (GH) fluid model we study the influence of strong coupling induced modification of the fluid compressibility on the dynamics of compressional Mach cones in a dusty plasma medium. EOS A significant structural change of lateral wakes for a given Mach number and Epstein drag force is found in the strongly coupled regime. EOS With the increase of fluid compressibility, the peak amplitude of the normalised perturbed dust density first increases and then decreases monotonically after reaching its maximum value.	It is also noticed that the opening angle of the cone structure decreases with the increase of the compressibility of the medium and the arm of the Mach cone breaks up into small structures in the velocity vector profile when the coupling between the dust particles increases.

Our approach is split into object localization, instance segmentation, learning and tracking stages.
doc	Diffusion Anomaly in a three dimensional lattice gas EOS We investigate the relation between thermodynamic and dynamic properties of an associating lattice gas (ALG) model. EOS The ALG combines a three dimensional lattice gas with particles interacting through a soft core potential and orientational degrees of freedom. EOS From the competition between the directional attractive forces and the soft core potential results two liquid phases, double criticality and density anomaly. EOS We study the mobility of the molecules in this model by calculating the diffusion constant at a constant temperature, _EQN_. EOS We show that _EQN_ has a maximum at a density _EQN_ and a minimum at a density _EQN_. EOS Between these densities the diffusivity differs from the one expected for normal liquids.	We also show that in the pressure-temperature phase-diagram the line of extrema in diffusivity is close to the liquid-liquid critical point and it is partially inside the temperature of maximum density (TMD) line.

EOS The variables a and b equal (C - A) and (C - B) respectively and are nonzero integer factors of 2M^2 where M is a non-zero integer. EOS C is greater than (a + b) since the square root of 2ab is an imaginary number when C is less than (a + b). EOS C is equal or greater than (a + b + 1) since we are only considering whole numbers. EOS The derivation of the solution set for n = 2 is applied to n = 3, n = 4, and generalized to n. EOS The solution set for n = n is [C - (a + b)]^n = ab([n:2]C^(n-2)*(2) - [n:3]C^(n-3)*(3a + 3b)+...

EOS ] is the coefficient of the x^r term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power (1 + x)^n and [n:r] = 0 if r > n. EOS Divide this equation by [C-(a + b)]^(n-2) to obtain [C-(a + b)]^2. EOS The solution set for [C - (a + b)]^2 equals 2ab. EOS The nth solution set equals 2ab only when n equals 2. EOS [C - (a + b)]^2 (I.e., [C - (a + b)]^n divided by [C - (a + b)]^(n-2)) is always greater than 2ab when n is greater than 2.	Non-zero integer solutions exist only for n = 2.

doc	Faraday Rotation of Microwave Background Polarization by a Primordial Magnetic Field EOS The existence of a primordial magnetic field at the last scattering surface may induce a measurable Faraday rotation in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background. EOS We calculate the magnitude of this effect by evolving the radiative transfer equations for the microwave background polarization through the epoch of last scatter, in the presence of a magnetic field.	For a primordial field amplitude corresponding to a present value of _EQN_ (which would account for the observed galactic field if it were frozen in the pre-galactic plasma), we find a rotation angle of around _EQN_ at a frequency of 30 GHz.

EOS In particular, we tried to find a hint of merger-induced recent star formation (RSF) in red sequence galaxies. EOS Using the NUV - r' colors of the galaxies, RSF fractions were derived based on various criteria for post-merger galaxies and normal galaxies. EOS Following k-correction, about 36% of the post-merger galaxies were classified as RSF galaxies with a conservative criterion (NUV - r' \leq 5), and that number was doubled (~ 72%) when using a generous criterion (NUV - r' \leq 5.4). EOS The trend was the same when we restricted the sample to galaxies within 0.5xR_ 200. EOS Post-merger galaxies with strong UV emission showed more violent, asymmetric features in the deep optical images. EOS The RSF fractions did not show any trend along the clustocentric distance within R_ 200. EOS We performed a Dressler-Shectman test to check whether the RSF galaxies had any correlation with the sub-structures in the galaxy clusters.	Within R_ 200 of each cluster, the RSF galaxies did not appear to be preferentially related to the clusters' sub-structures.
doc	Bayesian Model comparison of Higgs couplings EOS We investigate the possibility of contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) to the Higgs couplings, in the light of the LHC data. EOS The work is performed within an interim framework where the magnitude of the Higgs production and decay rates are rescaled though Higgs coupling scale factors. EOS We perform Bayesian parameter inference on these scale factors, concluding that there is good compatibility with the SM. EOS Furthermore, we carry out Bayesian model comparison on all models where any combination of scale factors can differ from their SM values and find that typically models with fewer free couplings are strongly favoured. EOS We consider the evidence that each coupling individually equals the SM value, making the minimal assumptions on the other couplings.	Finally, we make a comparison of the SM against a single "not-SM" model, and find that there is moderate to strong evidence for the SM.

doc	A Cloud-based Approach for Context Information Provisioning EOS As a result of the phenomenal proliferation of modern mobile Internet-enabled devices and the widespread utilization of wireless and cellular data networks, mobile users are increasingly requiring services tailored to their current context. EOS High-level context information is typically obtained from context services that aggregate raw context information sensed by various sensors and mobile devices. EOS Given the massive amount of sensed data, traditional context services are lacking the necessary resources to store and process these data, as well as to disseminate high-level context information to a variety of potential context consumers. EOS In this paper, we propose a novel framework for context information provisioning, which relies on deploying context services on the cloud and using context brokers to mediate between context consumers and context services using a publish/subscribe model.	Moreover, we describe a multi-attributes decision algorithm for the selection of potential context services that can fulfill context consumers' requests for context information.

EOS (in the quadratic case) and the relative trace formula of Jacquet and Lai. EOS Certain matching statements relating this twisted relative trace formula to a relative trace formula are also proven (including the relevant undamental lemma in the "biquadratic case"). EOS Using recent work of Jacquet, Lapid and their collaborators and the Rankin-Selberg integral representation of the Asai _EQN_ -function (obtained by Flicker using the theory of Jacquet, Piatetskii-Shapiro, and Shalika), we give the following application: Let _EQN_ be a totally real quadratic extension with _EQN_, let _EQN_ be a quasi-split unitary group with respect to a CM extension _EQN_, and let _EQN_. EOS Under suitable local hypotheses, we show that a cuspidal cohomological automorphic representation _EQN_ of _EQN_ whose Asai _EQN_ -function has a pole at the edge of the critical strip is nearly equivalent to a cuspidal cohomological automorphic representation _EQN_ of _EQN_ that is _EQN_ -distinguished in the sense that there is a form in the space of _EQN_ admitting a nonzero period over _EQN_.

EOS Non-normal distributions combine the risk in the left tail with the opportunities in the right tail -- unifying the "risk premium" with the possible loss.	Risk and reward must be part of the same picture and expected returns must include possible losses due to risks.

doc	Snapping of Bistable, Prestressed Cylindrical Shells EOS Bistable shells can reversibly change between two stable configurations with very little energetic input. EOS Understanding what governs the shape and snap-through criteria of these structures is crucial for designing devices that utilize instability for functionality. EOS Bistable cylindrical shells fabricated by stretching and bonding multiple layers of elastic plates will contain residual stress that will impact the shell's shape and the magnitude of stimulus necessary to induce snapping. EOS Using the framework of non-Euclidean shell theory, we first predict the mean curvature of a nearly cylindrical shell formed by arbitrarily prestretching one layer of a bilayer plate with respect to another. EOS Then, beginning with a residually stressed cylinder, we determine the amount of the stimuli needed to trigger the snapping between two configurations through a combination of numerical simulations and theory.	We demonstrate the role of prestress on the snap-through criteria, and highlight the important role that the Gaussian curvature in the boundary layer of the shell plays in dictating shell stability.

We found the ratio of compressible mode increases not only with the Alfv\'en Mach number but with the background magnetization, which indicates a strong coupling between the fast and Alfv\'en modes and appearance of a new regime of RMHD turbulence in Poynting-dominated plasmas where the fast and Alfv\'en modes strongly couples and cannot be separated, different from the non-relativistic MHD case.

Its primary mission is to study the composition, formation and evolution of our Galaxy.
doc	Non-equilibrium fluctuations in a driven stochastic Lorentz gas EOS We study the stationary state of a one-dimensional kinetic model where a probe particle is driven by an external field E and collides, elastically or inelastically, with a bath of particles at temperature T. EOS We focus on the stationary distribution of the velocity of the particle, and of two estimates of the total entropy production \Delta s_tot. EOS One is the entropy production of the medium \Delta s_m, which is equal to the energy exchanged with the scatterers, divided by a parameter \theta, coinciding with the particle temperature at E=0. EOS The other is the work W done by the external field, again rescaled by \theta. EOS At small E, a good collapse of the two distributions is found: in this case the two quantities also verify the Fluctuation Relation (FR), indicating that both are good approximations of \Delta s_tot.	Differently, for large values of E, the fluctuations of W violate the FR, while \Delta s_m still verifies it.
doc	Extended finite-size scaling of synchronized coupled oscillators EOS We present a systematic analysis of dynamic scaling in the time evolution of the phase order parameter for coupled oscillators with non-identical natural frequencies in terms of the Kuramoto model. EOS This provides a comprehensive view of phase synchronization.	In particular, we extend finite-size scaling (FSS) in the steady state to dynamics, determine critical exponents, and find the critical coupling strength.

doc	SAP: an Architecture for Selectively Approximate Wireless Communication EOS Integrity checking is ubiquitous in data networks, but not all network traffic needs integrity protection. EOS Many applications can tolerate slightly damaged data while still working acceptably, trading accuracy versus efficiency to save time and energy. EOS Such applications should be able to receive damaged data if they so desire. EOS In today's network stacks, lower-layer integrity checks discard damaged data regardless of the application's wishes, violating the End-to-End Principle. EOS This paper argues for optional integrity checking and gently redesigns a commodity network architecture to support integrity-unprotected data. EOS Our scheme, called Selective Approximate Protocol (SAP), allows applications to coordinate multiple network layers to accept potentially damaged data. EOS Unlike previous schemes that targeted video or media streaming, SAP is generic. EOS SAP's improved throughput and decreased retransmission rate is a good match for applications in the domain of approximate computing. EOS Implemented atop WiFi as a case study, SAP works with existing physical layers and requires no hardware changes. EOS SAP's benefits increase as channel conditions degrade.	In tests of an error-tolerant file-transfer application over WiFi, SAP sped up transmission by about 30% on average.

doc	Saliency difference based objective evaluation method for a superimposed screen of the HUD with various background EOS The head-up display (HUD) is an emerging device which can project information on a transparent screen. EOS The HUD has been used in airplanes and vehicles, and it is usually placed in front of the operator's view. EOS In the case of the vehicle, the driver can see not only various information on the HUD but also the backgrounds (driving environment) through the HUD. EOS However, the projected information on the HUD may interfere with the colors in the background because the HUD is transparent. EOS For example, a red message on the HUD will be less noticeable when there is an overlap between it and the red brake light from the front vehicle. EOS As the first step to solve this issue, how to evaluate the mutual interference between the information on the HUD and backgrounds is important.	Therefore, this paper proposes a method to evaluate the mutual interference based on saliency.
doc	Bloch sphere model for two-qubit pure states EOS The two-qubit pure state is explicitly parameterized by three unit 2-spheres and a phase factor. EOS For separable states, two of the three unit spheres are the Bloch spheres of each qubit. EOS The third sphere parameterizes the degree and phase of concurrence, an entanglement measure. EOS This sphere may be considered a variable complex imaginary unit where the stereographic projection maps the qubit-A Bloch sphere to a complex plane with this variable imaginary unit. EOS This Bloch sphere model gives a consistent description of the two-qubit pure states for both separable and entangled states. EOS We argue that the third sphere (entanglement sphere) parameterizes the nonlocal properties, entanglement and a nonlocal relative phase, while the local relative phases are parameterized by the azimuth angles of the two quasi-Bloch spheres.	On these three unit spheres and a phase factor, the two-qubit pure states and unitary gates can be geometrically represented.
doc	KK Parity in Warped Extra Dimension EOS We construct models with a Kaluza-Klein (KK) parity in a five- dimensional warped geometry, in an attempt to address the little hierarchy problem present in setups with bulk Standard Model fields. EOS The lightest KK particle (LKP) is stable and can play the role of dark matter. EOS We consider the possibilities of gluing two identical slices of 5D AdS in either the UV (IR-UV-IR model) or the IR region (UV-IR-UV model) and discuss the model-building issues as well as phenomenological properties in both cases. EOS In particular, we find that the UV-IR-UV model is not gravitationally stable and that additional mechanisms might be required in the IR-UV-IR model in order to address flavor issues.	Collider signals of the warped KK parity are different from either the conventional warped extra dimension without KK parity, in which the new particles are not necessarily pair-produced, or the KK parity in flat universal extra dimensions, where each KK level is nearly degenerate in mass.

doc	Core Decomposition in Multilayer Networks: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications EOS Multilayer networks are a powerful paradigm to model complex systems, where multiple relations occur between the same entities. EOS Despite the keen interest in a variety of tasks, algorithms, and analyses in this type of network, the problem of extracting dense subgraphs has remained largely unexplored so far. EOS In this work we study the problem of core decomposition of a multilayer network. EOS The multilayer context is much challenging as no total order exists among multilayer cores; EOS rather, they form a lattice whose size is exponential in the number of layers.	In this setting we devise three algorithms which differ in the way they visit the core lattice and in their pruning techniques.
doc	Symmetric single-impurity Kondo model on a tight-binding chain: a comparison of analytical and numerical ground-state approaches EOS We analyze the ground-state energy, local spin correlation, impurity spin polarization, impurity-induced magnetization, and corresponding zero-field susceptibilities of the symmetric single-impurity Kondo model on a tight-binding chain with bandwidth _EQN_ and coupling strength _EQN_. EOS We compare perturbative results and variational upper bounds from Yosida, Gutzwiller, and first-order Lanczos wave functions to the numerically exact data obtained from the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and from the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) methods. EOS The Gutzwiller variational approach becomes exact in the strong-coupling limit and reproduces the ground-state properties from DMRG and NRG for large couplings.	We calculate the impurity spin polarization and its susceptibility in the presence of magnetic fields that are applied globally/locally to the impurity spin.
doc	Intelligent Traffic Light Control Using Distributed Multi-agent Q Learning EOS The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things (IoT), which is denoted as AI-powered Internet-of-Things (AIoT), is capable of processing huge amount of data generated from a large number of devices and handling complex problems in social infrastructures. EOS As AI and IoT technologies are becoming mature, in this paper, we propose to apply AIoT technologies for traffic light control, which is an essential component for intelligent transportation system, to improve the efficiency of smart city's road system. EOS Specifically, various sensors such as surveillance cameras provide real-time information for intelligent traffic light control system to observe the states of both motorized traffic and non-motorized traffic. EOS In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic light control solution by using distributed multi-agent Q learning, considering the traffic information at the neighboring intersections as well as local motorized and non-motorized traffic, to improve the overall performance of the entire control system.	By using the proposed multi-agent Q learning algorithm, our solution is targeting to optimize both the motorized and non-motorized traffic.

doc	The History and Present Status of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime EOS Quantum field theory in curved spacetime is a theory wherein matter is treated fully in accord with the principles of quantum field theory, but gravity is treated classically in accord with general relativity. EOS It is not expected to be an exact theory of nature, but it should provide a good approximate description when the quantum effects of gravity itself do not play a dominant role. EOS A major impetus to the theory was provided by Hawking's calculation of particle creation by black holes, showing that black holes radiate as perfect black bodies. EOS During the past 30 years, considerable progress has been made in giving a mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.	Major issues of principle with regard to the formulation of the theory arise from the lack of Poincare symmetry and the absence of a preferred vacuum state or preferred notion of ``particles''.
doc	Structure, spectra and variability of some GPS radio sources EOS We report the results of multifrequency-VLBI observations of GHz-Peaked-Spectrum (GPS) radio sources. EOS The VLBI structure and component spectra of some GPS sources are presented. EOS Our VLBI results show that about 80% of the GPS galaxies exhibit a compact double or CSO-like structure, while the GPS quasars tend to show a core-jet.	The component spectra of the GPS galaxies are often steep/convex, and the core has a flat spectrum but it is usually hidden or weak.

doc	Stable Camera Motion Estimation Using Convex Programming EOS We study the inverse problem of estimating n locations _EQN_ (up to global scale, translation and negation) in _EQN_ from noisy measurements of a subset of the (unsigned) pairwise lines that connect them, that is, from noisy measurements of _EQN_ for some pairs (i,j) (where the signs are unknown). EOS This problem is at the core of the structure from motion (SfM) problem in computer vision, where the _EQN_ 's represent camera locations in _EQN_. EOS The noiseless version of the problem, with exact line measurements, has been considered previously under the general title of parallel rigidity theory, mainly in order to characterize the conditions for unique realization of locations. EOS For noisy pairwise line measurements, current methods tend to produce spurious solutions that are clustered around a few locations.	This sensitivity of the location estimates is a well-known problem in SfM, especially for large, irregular collections of images.
doc	Information and fundamental elements of the structure of quantum theory EOS Niels Bohr wrote: "There is no quantum world. EOS There is only an abstract quantum physical description. EOS It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. EOS Physics concerns what we can say about Nature." In an analogous way, von Weizsaecker suggested that the notion of the elementary alternative, the "Ur", should play a pivotal role when constructing physics. EOS Both approaches suggest that the concept of information should play an essential role in the foundations of any scientific description of Nature. EOS We show that if, in our description of Nature, we use one definite proposition per elementary constituent of Nature, some of the essential characteristics of quantum physics, such as the irreducible randomness of individual events, quantum complementary and quantum entanglement, arise in a natural way.	Then quantum physics is an elementary theory of information.
doc	Interacting Neural Networks EOS Several scenarios of interacting neural networks which are trained either in an identical or in a competitive way are solved analytically. EOS In the case of identical training each perceptron receives the output of its neighbour.	The symmetry of the stationary state as well as the sensitivity to the used training algorithm are investigated.
doc	Expectile based measures of skewness EOS In the literature, quite a few measures have been proposed for quantifying the deviation of a probability distribution from symmetry. EOS The most popular of these skewness measures are based on the third centralized moment and on quantiles. EOS However, there are major drawbacks in using these quantities. EOS These include a strong emphasis on the distributional tails and a poor asymptotic behaviour for the (empirical) moment based measure as well as difficult statistical inference and strange behaviour for discrete distributions for quantile based measures. EOS Therefore, in this paper, we introduce skewness measures based on or connected with expectiles.	Since expectiles can be seen as smoothed versions of quantiles, they preserve the advantages over the moment based measure while not exhibiting most of the disadvantages of quantile based measures.
doc	StreamChain: Rethinking Blockchain for Datacenters EOS Permissioned blockchains promise secure decentralized data management in business-to-business use-cases. EOS In contrast to Bitcoin and similar public blockchains which rely on Proof-of-Work for consensus and are deployed on thousands of geo-distributed nodes, business-to-business use-cases (such as supply chain management and banking) require significantly fewer nodes, cheaper consensus, and are often deployed in datacenter-like environments with fast networking. EOS However, permissioned blockchains often follow the architectural thinkining behind their WAN-oriented public relatives, which results in end-to-end latencies several orders of magnitude higher than necessary. EOS In this work, we propose StreamChain, a permissioned blockchain design that eliminates blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion.	This results in a drastically lower latency without reducing throughput or forfeiting reliability and security guarantees.
doc	Phonon Resonant Cavities as a Promising Building Blocks of Hand-Made Nanocrystalline Matter EOS The nanocrystallite have the finite number of the oscillation modes. EOS Their number increases proportionally to a cube of the characteristic size. EOS Thus the oscillation spectrum of nanocrystal becomes discrete, and the separate modes of oscillations does not interact with each other, that considerably strengthens all phonon modulated processes in a crystal. EOS Covering of such a nanocrystallite with the shielding surface of a material with the higher nuclear weight will allow to create the phonon resonant cavity whose oscillation modes will represent the standing waves and, will be amplified by the resonant manner.	The composites made of phonon resonant cavities will allow to produce a perspective functional material for the electronics with adjustable structure and properties.
doc	Impact of medium effects on the cooling of non-superfluid and superfluid neutron stars EOS Neutrino emission from the dense hadronic component in neutron stars is subject to strong modifications due to collective effects in the nuclear medium. EOS We implement new estimates of the neutrino emissivities of two processes operating in the nuclear medium into numerical cooling simulations of neutron stars. EOS The first process is the modified Urca process, for which the softening of the pion exchange mode and other polarization effects as well as the neutrino emission arising from the intermediate reaction states are taken into account.	The second process concerns neutrino emission through superfluid pair breaking and formation processes.

doc	The spread of epidemic disease on networks EOS The study of social networks, and in particular the spread of disease on networks, has attracted considerable recent attention in the physics community. EOS In this paper, we show that a large class of standard epidemiological models, the so-called susceptible/infective/removed (SIR) models can be solved exactly on a wide variety of networks. EOS In addition to the standard but unrealistic case of fixed infectiveness time and fixed and uncorrelated probability of transmission between all pairs of individuals, we solve cases in which times and probabilities are non-uniform and correlated. EOS We also consider one simple case of an epidemic in a structured population, that of a sexually transmitted disease in a population divided into men and women.	We confirm the correctness of our exact solutions with numerical simulations of SIR epidemics on networks.
doc	Phase behavior of charged colloids at a fluid interface EOS We study the phase behavior of a system of charged colloidal particles that are electrostatically bound to an almost flat interface between two fluids. EOS We show that, despite the fact that our experimental system consists of only _EQN_ - _EQN_ particles, the phase behavior is consistent with the theory of melting due to Kosterlitz, Thouless, Halperin, Nelson and Young (KTHNY).	Using spatial and temporal correlations of the bond-orientational order parameter, we classify our samples into solid, isotropic fluid, and hexatic phases.
doc	Evaluating Voice Conversion-based Privacy Protection against Informed Attackers EOS Speech data conveys sensitive speaker attributes like identity or accent. EOS With a small amount of found data, such attributes can be inferred and exploited for malicious purposes: voice cloning, spoofing, etc. EOS Anonymization aims to make the data unlinkable, i.e., ensure that no utterance can be linked to its original speaker. EOS In this paper, we investigate anonymization methods based on voice conversion.	In contrast to prior work, we argue that various linkage attacks can be designed depending on the attackers' knowledge about the anonymization scheme.
doc	Extension of _EQN_ MSM model and possible explanations of recent astronomical and collider observations EOS Here I present the extension to _EQN_ MSM model by adding a _EQN_ gauge symmetry under which right-handed fermions including sterile neutrinos and exotic Higgs scalar are charged. EOS This model explains 3.5 keV line observed by XMM-Newton telescope as well as Galactic Center Excess(GCE) detected by Fermi-LAT satellite. EOS The proposed model also accounts for recent diphoton excess of mass around 750 GeV produced in ATLAS and CMS detectors.	Cosmological inconsistencies such as baryon asymmetry can also be explained.

doc	Modelling the Structure and Dynamics of Science Using Books EOS Scientific research is a major driving force in a knowledge based economy. EOS Income, health and wellbeing depend on scientific progress. EOS The better we understand the inner workings of the scientific enterprise, the better we can prompt, manage, steer, and utilize scientific progress. EOS Diverse indicators and approaches exist to evaluate and monitor research activities, from calculating the reputation of a researcher, institution, or country to analyzing and visualizing global brain circulation. EOS However, there are very few predictive models of science that are used by key decision makers in academia, industry, or government interested to improve the quality and impact of scholarly efforts. EOS We present a novel 'bibliographic bibliometric' analysis which we apply to a large collection of books relevant for the modelling of science. EOS We explain the data collection together with the results of the data analyses and visualizations.	In the final section we discuss how the analysis of books that describe different modelling approaches can inform the design of new models of science.
doc	A hybrid finite volume -- finite element method for bulk--surface coupled problems EOS The paper develops a hybrid method for solving a system of advection--diffusion equations in a bulk domain coupled to advection--diffusion equations on an embedded surface. EOS A monotone nonlinear finite volume method for equations posed in the bulk is combined with a trace finite element method for equations posed on the surface. EOS In our approach, the surface is not fitted by the mesh and is allowed to cut through the background mesh in an arbitrary way. EOS Moreover, a triangulation of the surface into regular shaped elements is not required. EOS The background mesh is an octree grid with cubic cells. EOS As an example of an application, we consider the modeling of contaminant transport in fractured porous media. EOS One standard model leads to a coupled system of advection--diffusion equations in a bulk (matrix) and along a surface (fracture).	A series of numerical experiments with both steady and unsteady problems and different embedded geometries illustrate the numerical properties of the hybrid approach.

doc	Deterministic Designs with Deterministic Guarantees: Toeplitz Compressed Sensing Matrices, Sequence Designs and System Identification EOS In this paper we present a new family of discrete sequences having "random like" uniformly decaying auto-correlation properties. EOS The new class of infinite length sequences are higher order chirps constructed using irrational numbers. EOS Exploiting results from the theory of continued fractions and diophantine approximations, we show that the class of sequences so formed has the property that the worst-case auto-correlation coefficients for every finite length sequence decays at a polynomial rate. EOS These sequences display doppler immunity as well. EOS We also show that Toeplitz matrices formed from such sequences satisfy restricted-isometry-property (RIP), a concept that has played a central role recently in Compressed Sensing applications. EOS Compressed sensing has conventionally dealt with sensing matrices with arbitrary components.	Nevertheless, such arbitrary sensing matrices are not appropriate for linear system identification and one must employ Toeplitz structured sensing matrices.
doc	An Alternative Proof for the Capacity Region of the Degraded Gaussian MIMO Broadcast Channel EOS We provide an alternative proof for the capacity region of the degraded Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel.

doc	Get my pizza right: Repairing missing is-a relations in ALC ontologies (extended version) EOS With the increased use of ontologies in semantically-enabled applications, the issue of debugging defects in ontologies has become increasingly important. EOS These defects can lead to wrong or incomplete results for the applications. EOS Debugging consists of the phases of detection and repairing. EOS In this paper we focus on the repairing phase of a particular kind of defects, i.e. EOS the missing relations in the is-a hierarchy. EOS Previous work has dealt with the case of taxonomies.	In this work we extend the scope to deal with ALC ontologies that can be represented using acyclic terminologies.

doc	Image Projective Invariants EOS In this paper, we propose relative projective differential invariants (RPDIs) which are invariant to general projective transformations. EOS By using RPDIs and the structural frame of integral invariant, projective weighted moment invariants (PIs) can be constructed very easily. EOS It is first proved that a kind of projective invariants exists in terms of weighted integration of images, with relative differential invariants as the weight functions. EOS Then, some simple instances of PIs are given. EOS In order to ensure the stability and discriminability of PIs, we discuss how to calculate partial derivatives of discrete images more accurately. EOS Since the number of pixels in discrete images before and after the geometric transformation may be different, we design the method to normalize the number of pixels. EOS These ways enhance the performance of PIs.	Finally, we carry out some experiments based on synthetic and real image datasets.
doc	Differentiable model-based adaptive optics with transmitted and reflected light EOS Aberrations limit optical systems in many situations, for example when imaging in biological tissue. EOS Machine learning offers novel ways to improve imaging under such conditions by learning inverse models of aberrations. EOS Learning requires datasets that cover a wide range of possible aberrations, which however becomes limiting for more strongly scattering samples, and does not take advantage of prior information about the imaging process. EOS Here, we show that combining model-based adaptive optics with the optimization techniques of machine learning frameworks can find aberration corrections with a small number of measurements.	Corrections are determined in a transmission configuration through a single aberrating layer and in a reflection configuration through two different layers at the same time.
doc	Direct Construction of a Dividing Surface of Minimal Flux for Multi-Degree-of-Freedom Systems: The Equivalence of Conventional and Variational Transition State Theory EOS The fundamental assumption of conventional transition state theory is the existence of a dividing surface having the property that trajectories originating in reactants must cross the surface only once and then proceed to products.	Recently it has been shown how to construct a dividing surface in phase space for Hamiltonian systems with an arbitrary (but finite) number of degrees of freedom having the property that trajectories only cross once locally.

doc	Seamless Integration of Global Dirichlet-to-Neumann Boundary Condition and Spectral Elements for Transformation Electromagnetics EOS In this paper, we present an efficient spectral-element method (SEM) for solving general two-dimensional Helmholtz equations in anisotropic media, with particular applications in accurate simulation of polygonal invisibility cloaks, concentrators and circular rotators arisen from the field of transformation electromagnetics (TE). EOS In practice, we adopt a transparent boundary condition (TBC) characterized by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map to reduce wave propagation in an unbounded domain to a bounded domain. EOS We then introduce a semi-analytic technique to integrate the global TBC with local curvilinear elements seamlessly, which is accomplished by using a novel elemental mapping and analytic formulas for evaluating global Fourier coefficients on spectral-element grids exactly.	From the perspective of TE, an invisibility cloak is devised by a singular coordinate transformation of Maxwell's equations that leads to anisotropic materials coating the cloaked region to render any object inside invisible to observers outside.
doc	Flat ORAM: A Simplified Write-Only Oblivious RAM Construction for Secure Processors EOS Oblivious RAM (ORAM) is a cryptographic primitive which obfuscates the access patterns to a storage thereby preventing privacy leakage. EOS So far in the current literature, only `fully functional' ORAMs are widely studied which can protect, at a cost of considerable performance penalty, against the strong adversaries who can monitor all read and write operations. EOS However, recent research has shown that information can still be leaked even if only the write access pattern (not reads) is visible to the adversary. EOS For such weaker adversaries, a fully functional ORAM turns out to be an overkill causing unnecessary overheads.	Instead, a simple `write-only' ORAM is sufficient, and, more interestingly, is preferred as it can offer far more performance and energy efficiency than a fully functional ORAM.
doc	Tri-Maximal vs Bi-Maximal Neutrino Mixing EOS It is argued that data from atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments point strongly to tri-maximal or bi-maximal lepton mixing.	While (`optimised') bi-maximal mixing gives an excellent a posteriori fit to the data, tri-maximal mixing is an a priori hypothesis, which is not excluded, taking account of terrestrial matter effects.
doc	Between Discord and Deadlock: Consensus Under a Deadline EOS Committee decisions are complicated by a deadline, e.g., the next start of a budget, or the beginning of a semester.

doc	Probing the Intra-Component Correlations within Fisher Vector for Material Classification EOS Fisher vector (FV) has become a popular image representation. EOS One notable underlying assumption of the FV framework is that local descriptors are well decorrelated within each cluster so that the covariance matrix for each Gaussian can be simplified to be diagonal. EOS Though the FV usually relies on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to decorrelate local features, the PCA is applied to the entire training data and hence it only diagonalizes the \textit universal covariance matrix, rather than those w.r.t. EOS the local components. EOS As a result, the local decorrelation assumption is usually not supported in practice. EOS To relax this assumption, this paper proposes a completed model of the Fisher vector, which is termed as the Completed Fisher vector (CFV). EOS The CFV is a more general framework of the FV, since it encodes not only the variances but also the correlations of the whitened local descriptors. EOS The CFV thus leads to improved discriminative power.	We take the task of material categorization as an example and experimentally show that: 1) the CFV outperforms the FV under all parameter settings;
doc	A substructure analysis of the A3558 cluster complex EOS The "algorithm driven by the density estimate for the identification of clusters" (DEDICA, Pisani 1993, 1996) is applied to the A3558 cluster complex in order to find substructures. EOS This complex, located at the center of the Shapley Concentration supercluster, is a chain formed by the ACO clusters A3556, A3558 and A3562 and the two poor clusters SC 1327-312 and SC 1329-313. EOS We find a large number of clumps, indicating that strong dynamical processes are active. EOS In particular, it is necessary to use a fully three-dimensional sample(i.e. EOS using the galaxy velocity as third coordinate) in order to recover also the clumps superimposed along the line of sight. EOS Even if a great number of detected substructures were already found in a previous analysis (Bardelli et al 1998), this method is more efficient and faster when compared with the use of a wide battery of tests and permits the direct estimate of the detection significance. EOS Almost all subclusters previously detected by the wavelet analyses found in the literature are recognized by DEDICA. EOS On the basis of the substructure analysis, we also briefly discuss the origin of the A3558 complex by comparing two hypotheses: 1) the structure is a cluster-cluster collision seen just after the first core-core encounter;	2) this complex is the result of a series of incoherent group-group and cluster-group mergings, focused in that region by the presence of the surrounding supercluster.
doc	Is gravity getting weaker at low z? Observational evidence and theoretical implications EOS Dynamical observational probes of the growth of density perturbations indicate that gravity may be getting weaker at low redshifts _EQN_. EOS This evidence is at about _EQN_ level and comes mainly from weak lensing data that measure the parameter _EQN_ and redshift space distortion data that measure the growth rate times the amplitude of the linear power spectrum parameter _EQN_. EOS The measured _EQN_ appears to be lower than the prediction of General Relativity (GR) in the context of the standard _EQN_ CDM model as defined by the Planck best fit parameter values. EOS This is the well known _EQN_ tension of _EQN_ CDM, which constitutes one of the two main large scale challenges of the model along with the _EQN_ tension. EOS We review the observational evidence that leads to the _EQN_ tension and discuss some theoretical implications. EOS If this tension is not a systematic effect it may be an early hint of modified gravity with an evolving effective Newton's constant _EQN_ and gravitational slip parameter _EQN_. EOS We discuss such best fit parametrizations of _EQN_ and point out that they can not be reproduced by simple scalar-tensor and _EQN_ modified gravity theories because these theories generically predict stronger gravity than General Relativity (GR) at low _EQN_ in the context of a _EQN_ CDM background _EQN_.	Finally, we show weak evidence for an evolving reduced absolute magnitude of the SnIa of the Pantheon dataset at low redshifts (_EQN_) which may also be explained by a reduced strength of gravity and may help resolve the _EQN_ tension.

doc	Optimality of constant inflow for a linear system with a bottleneck entrance EOS Sadeghi et al considered a bottleneck system with periodic inflow rate, and proved that a constant-rate input maximizes the time-averaged output rate among all periodic inflow rates. EOS Here we provide a short and elementary proof of this result, without use of optimal control theory.	The new approach developed here allows us to prove an extension of the result to the case of a general non-periodic inflow rate.
doc	Content-based Propagation of User Markings for Interactive Segmentation of Patterned Images EOS Efficient and easy segmentation of images and volumes is of great practical importance. EOS Segmentation problems that motivate our approach originate from microscopy imaging commonly used in materials science, medicine, and biology. EOS We formulate image segmentation as a probabilistic pixel classification problem, and we apply segmentation as a step towards characterising image content. EOS Our method allows the user to define structures of interest by interactively marking a subset of pixels. EOS Thanks to the real-time feedback, the user can place new markings strategically, depending on the current outcome. EOS The final pixel classification may be obtained from a very modest user input. EOS An important ingredient of our method is a graph that encodes image content. EOS This graph is built in an unsupervised manner during initialisation and is based on clustering of image features.	Since we combine a limited amount of user-labelled data with the clustering information obtained from the unlabelled parts of the image, our method fits in the general framework of semi-supervised learning.
doc	Radial motions in disk stars: ellipticity or secular flows? EOS Average stellar orbits of the Galactic disk may have some small intrinsic ellipticity which breaks the exact axisymmetry and there may also be some migration of stars inwards or outwards. EOS Both phenomena can be detected through kinematic analyses.

doc	Prediction and description of a chiral pseudogap phase EOS We point out that a system which supports chiral superconductivity should also support a chiral pseudogap phase: a finite temperature phase wherein superconductivity is lost but time reversal symmetry is still broken. EOS This chiral pseudogap phase can be viewed as a state with phase incoherent Cooper pairs of a definite angular momentum. EOS This physical picture suggests that the chiral pseudogap phase should have definite magnetization, should exhibit a (non-quantized) charge Hall effect, and should possess protected edge states that lead to a quantized thermal Hall response.	We explain how these phenomena are realized in a Ginzburg-Landau description, and comment on the experimental signatures of the chiral pseudogap phase.
doc	Discretized kinetic theory on scale-free networks EOS The network of interpersonal connections is one of the possible heterogeneous factors which affect the income distribution emerging from micro-to-macro economic models. EOS In this paper we equip our model discussed in [1,2] with a network structure. EOS The model is based on a system of _EQN_ differential equations of the kinetic discretized-Boltzmann kind. EOS The network structure is incorporated in a probabilistic way, through the introduction of a link density _EQN_ and of correlation coefficients _EQN_, which give the conditioned probability that an individual with _EQN_ links is connected to one with _EQN_ links. EOS We study the properties of the equations and give analytical results concerning the existence, normalization and positivity of the solutions. EOS For a fixed network with _EQN_, we investigate numerically the dependence of the detailed and marginal equilibrium distributions on the initial conditions and on the exponent _EQN_.	Our results are compatible with those obtained from the Bouchaud-Mezard model and from agent-based simulations, and provide additional information about the dependence of the individual income on the level of connectivity.
doc	Zeeman-splitting-induced Topological Nodal Structure and Anomalous Hall Conductivity in ZrTe _EQN_ EOS We investigate the topological nodal structure of three-dimensional (3D) ZrTe _EQN_ driven by Zeeman splitting as a function of the direction of external magnetic (B) field by using a Wannier-function-based tight-binding (WFTB) model obtained from first-principles calculations. EOS It is known that small external stimuli can drive 3D ZrTe _EQN_ into different topological phases including Dirac semimetal. EOS In order to emphasize the effect of Zeeman splitting, we consider 3D ZrTe _EQN_ in a strong TI phase with a small band gap. EOS With Zeeman splitting greater than the band gap, the WFTB model suggests that a type-I nodal ring protected by (glide) mirror symmetry is formed when the B field aligns with the crystal _EQN_ or _EQN_ axes, and that a pair of type-I Weyl nodes are formed otherwise, when conduction and valence bands touch.	We show that a pair of Weyl nodes can disappear through formation of a nodal ring, rather than requiring two Weyl nodes with opposite chirality to come together.

Then, we introduce Janus, a tool for building an ontology from various XML schemas in a given domain.
doc	Expressing Algorithms As Concise As Possible via Computability Logic EOS This paper proposes a new approach to defining and expressing algorithms: the notion of task logical algorithms. EOS This notion allows the user to define an algorithm for a task _EQN_ as a set of agents who can collectively perform _EQN_. EOS This notion considerably simplifies the algorithm development process and can be seen as an integration of the sequential pseudocode and logical algorithms. EOS This observation requires some changes to algorithm development process.	We propose a two-step approach: the first step is to define an algorithm for a task _EQN_ via a set of agents that can collectively perform _EQN_.
doc	A multi-country dynamic factor model with stochastic volatility for euro area business cycle analysis EOS This paper develops a dynamic factor model that uses euro area (EA) country-specific information on output and inflation to estimate an area-wide measure of the output gap. EOS Our model assumes that output and inflation can be decomposed into country-specific stochastic trends and a common cyclical component. EOS Comovement in the trends is introduced by imposing a factor structure on the shocks to the latent states.	We moreover introduce flexible stochastic volatility specifications to control for heteroscedasticity in the measurement errors and innovations to the latent states.
doc	Spectral Density-Based and Measure-Preserving ABC for partially observed diffusion processes. An illustration on Hamiltonian SDEs EOS Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) has become one of the major tools of likelihood-free statistical inference in complex mathematical models. EOS Simultaneously, stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have developed to an established tool for modelling time dependent, real world phenomena with underlying random effects. EOS When applying ABC to stochastic models, two major difficulties arise.	First, the derivation of effective summary statistics and proper distances is particularly challenging, since simulations from the stochastic process under the same parameter configuration result in different trajectories.
doc	Quantum scissors: teleportation of single-mode optical states by means of a nonlocal single photon EOS We employ the quantum state of a single photon entangled with the vacuum (|1,0>-|0,1>), generated by a photon incident upon a symmetric beam splitter, to teleport single-mode quantum states of light by means of the Bennett protocol. EOS Teleportation of coherent states results in truncation of their Fock expansion to the first two terms. EOS We analyze the teleported ensembles by means of homodyne tomography and obtain fidelities of up to 99 per cent for low source state amplitudes. EOS This work is an experimental realization of the quantum scissors device proposed by Pegg, Phillips and Barnett (Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett.	81, 1604 (1998))
doc	Unsupervised Image Captioning EOS Deep neural networks have achieved great successes on the image captioning task. EOS However, most of the existing models depend heavily on paired image-sentence datasets, which are very expensive to acquire. EOS In this paper, we make the first attempt to train an image captioning model in an unsupervised manner. EOS Instead of relying on manually labeled image-sentence pairs, our proposed model merely requires an image set, a sentence corpus, and an existing visual concept detector. EOS The sentence corpus is used to teach the captioning model how to generate plausible sentences. EOS Meanwhile, the knowledge in the visual concept detector is distilled into the captioning model to guide the model to recognize the visual concepts in an image.	In order to further encourage the generated captions to be semantically consistent with the image, the image and caption are projected into a common latent space so that they can reconstruct each other.

The recent observation of the binary NS (BNS) merger event GW170817 associated with GRB 170817A brought a great deal of additional information and provided further support to the above connection, even though the identification of this burst as a canonical short GRB (SGRB) remains uncertain.
doc	Simultaneous intensive photometry and high resolution spectroscopy of delta Scuti stars IV. An improved picture of the pulsational behaviour of X Caeli EOS The delta Scuti star X Caeli has been the target of a simultaneous photometric (14 consecutive nights) and spectroscopic campaign (8 consecutive nigths). EOS From the analysis of light curves we were able to pick up 17 frequency components, most of which were already detected in two previous campaigns. EOS The comparison with the results of the previous campaigns shows that while some terms are rather stable (in particular the dominant mode at 7.39 c/d) others have conspicuous amplitude variations. EOS 14 photometric terms have been also detected in the radial velocity curve or in the analysis of the line profile variations. EOS There are no spectroscopic terms without photometric counterparts, and this means that there are no high--degree modes as observed in other delta Scuti stars. EOS The simultaneous fit of light and line profile variations has allowed the estimation of the inclination of rotational axis (about 70 deg.) and the l,m identification for many modes.	In particular there is clear evidence that the two shortest period modes are retrograde.

doc	Generalized susceptibilities for a perfect quantum gas EOS The system we consider here is a charged fermions gas in the effective mass approximation, and in grand-canonical conditions. EOS We assume that the particles are confined in a three dimensional cubic box _EQN_ with side _EQN_, and subjected to a constant magnetic field of intensity _EQN_. EOS Define the grand canonical generalized susceptibilities _EQN_, _EQN_, as successive partial derivatives with respect to _EQN_ of the grand canonical pressure _EQN_. EOS Denote by _EQN_ the thermodynamic limit of _EQN_. EOS Our main result is that _EQN_ admit as thermodynamic limit the corresponding partial derivatives with respect to _EQN_ of _EQN_.	In this paper we only give the main steps of the proofs, technical details will be given elsewhere.

doc	Quantum Fluctuations in the Superfluid State of the BCS-BEC Crossover EOS We determine the effects of quantum fluctuations about the T=0 mean field solution of the BCS-BEC crossover in a dilute Fermi gas using the functional integral method. EOS These fluctuations are described in terms of the zero point motion of collective modes and the virtual scattering of gapped quasiparticles. EOS We calculate their effects on various measurable properties, including chemical potential, ground state energy, the gap, the speed of sound and the Landau critical velocity. EOS At unitarity, we find excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo and experimental results. EOS In the BCS limit, we show analytically that we obtain Fermi liquid interaction corrections to thermodynamics including the Hartree shift.	In the BEC limit, we show that the theory leads to an approximate description of the reduction of the scattering length for bosonic molecules and also obtain quantum depletion of the Lee-Yang form.
doc	Squeezing and feedback EOS Electro-optical feedback has many features in common with optical nonlinearities and hence is relevant to the generation of squeezing. EOS First, I discuss theoretical and experimental results for traveling-wave feedback, emphasizing how the ``in-loop'' squeezing (also known as ``squashing'') differs from free squeezing. EOS Although such feedback, based on ordinary (demolition) photodetection cannot create free squeezing, it can be used to manipulate it.	Then I treat feedback based on nonlinear quantum optical measurements (of which non-demolition measurements are one example).
doc	A PCA-based approach for subtracting thermal background emission in high-contrast imaging data EOS Ground-based observations at thermal infrared wavelengths suffer from large background radiation due to the sky, telescope and warm surfaces in the instrument. EOS This significantly limits the sensitivity of ground-based observations at wavelengths longer than 3 microns. EOS We analyzed this background emission in infrared high contrast imaging data, show how it can be modelled and subtracted and demonstrate that it can improve the detection of faint sources, such as exoplanets. EOS We applied principal component analysis to model and subtract the thermal background emission in three archival high contrast angular differential imaging datasets in the M and L filter. EOS We describe how the algorithm works and explain how it can be applied. EOS The results of the background subtraction are compared to the results from a conventional mean background subtraction scheme. EOS Finally, both methods for background subtraction are also compared by performing complete data reductions. EOS We analyze the results from the M dataset of HD100546 qualitatively. EOS For the M band dataset of beta Pic and the L band dataset of HD169142, which was obtained with an annular groove phase mask vortex vector coronagraph, we also calculate and analyze the achieved signal to noise (S/N). EOS We show that applying PCA is an effective way to remove spatially and temporarily varying thermal background emission down to close to the background limit. EOS The procedure also proves to be very successful at reconstructing the background that is hidden behind the PSF.	In the complete data reductions, we find at least qualitative improvements for HD100546 and HD169142, however, we fail to find a significant increase in S/N of beta Pic b.
doc	Experimental demonstration of phase-remapping attack in a practical quantum key distribution system EOS Unconditional security proofs of various quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols are built on idealized assumptions. EOS One key assumption is: the sender (Alice) can prepare the required quantum states without errors. EOS However, such an assumption may be violated in a practical QKD system. EOS In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a technically feasible "intercept-and-resend" attack that exploits such a security loophole in a commercial "plug & play" QKD system. EOS The resulting quantum bit error rate is 19.7%, which is below the proven secure bound of 20.0% for the BB84 protocol. EOS The attack we utilize is the phase-remapping attack (C.-H.	F.

doc	Structure and evolution of the photospheric magnetic field in 2010 - 2017: comparison of SOLIS/VSM vector field and _EQN_ potential field EOS The line-of-sight (LOS) component of the large-scale photospheric magnetic field has been observed since the 1950s, but the daily full-disk observations of the full vector magnetic field started only in 2010 using the SOLIS Vector Stokes Magnetograph (VSM) and the SDO helioseismic and magnetic imager (HMI). EOS Traditionally, potential field extrapolations are based on the assumption that the magnetic field in the photosphere is approximately radial. EOS The validity of this assumption has not been tested yet. EOS We investigate here the structure and evolution of the three components of the solar large-scale magnetic field in 2010 - 2017, covering the ascending to mid-declining phase of solar cycle 24, using SOLIS/VSM vector synoptic maps of the photospheric magnetic field. EOS We compare the observed VSM vector magnetic field to the potential vector field derived using the VSM LOS magnetic field observations as an input. EOS The new vector field data allow us to derive the meridional inclination and the azimuth angle of the magnetic field and to investigate their solar cycle evolution and latitudinal profile of these quantities.	SOLIS/VSM vector data show that the photospheric magnetic field is in general fairly non-radial.

EOS The Larmor rotation of a test particle in a magnetic field is taken into account. EOS The analysis is based on the assumption that the energy variation of the test particle is much less than its kinetic energy.	The obtained general expression for stopping power is analyzed for three cases: (i) the particle moves through a collisionless plasma in a strong homogeneous magnetic field;
doc	The Abundance of Interstellar Boron EOS We use new Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and archival Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) observations to study interstellar B II 1362 and O I 1355 absorption along seven sightlines. EOS Our new column density measurements, combined with measurements of four sightlines from the literature, allow us to study the relative B/O abundances over a wide range of interstellar environments. EOS We measure sightline-integrated relative gas-phase abundances in the range [B/O] = -1.00 to -0.17, and our data show the B/O abundances are anticorrelated with average sightline densities over the range log <n_H> ~ -1.3 to +0.7. EOS Detailed comparisons of the B II and O I line shapes show that the B/O ratio is significantly higher in warm interstellar clouds than in cool clouds.	These results are consistent with the incorporation of boron into dust grains in the diffuse ISM.
doc	New _EQN_ Spanners and Hopsets EOS An _EQN_ -spanner of an unweighted _EQN_ -vertex graph _EQN_ is a subgraph _EQN_ satisfying that _EQN_ is at most _EQN_ for every _EQN_. EOS We present new spanner constructions that achieve a nearly optimal stretch of _EQN_ for any distance value _EQN_, and _EQN_. EOS We show the following: 1. EOS There exists an _EQN_ -spanner _EQN_ with _EQN_ for any _EQN_ with expected size _EQN_. EOS This in particular gives _EQN_ spanners with _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS 2. EOS For any _EQN_, there exists an _EQN_ -spanner with _EQN_, _EQN_ and of expected size _EQN_. EOS This implies a stretch of _EQN_ for any _EQN_, and for every _EQN_. EOS In particular, it provides a constant stretch already for vertex pairs at distance _EQN_ (improving upon _EQN_ that was known before). EOS Up to the _EQN_ factor in the exponent, and the constant factor in the stretch, this is the best possible by the girth argument. EOS 3. EOS For any _EQN_ and integer _EQN_, there is a _EQN_ -spanner with _EQN_ and _EQN_ edges. EOS We also consider the related graph concept of hopsets introduced by [Cohen, J. EOS ACM '00]. EOS We present a new family of _EQN_ hopsets with _EQN_ edges and _EQN_.	Most notably, we show a construction of _EQN_ hopset with _EQN_ edges and hop-bound of _EQN_, improving upon the state-of-the-art hop-bound of _EQN_ by [Elkin-Neiman, '17] and [Huang-Pettie, '17].

EOS A variety of shorter and longer segments of zinc-blende or wurtzite crystal phases are observed by transmission electron microscopy in the nanowires. EOS Sharp photoluminescence lines are observed with emission energies tuned from 1.515 eV down to 1.43 eV when the percentage of wurtzite is increased.	The downward shift of the emission peaks can be understood by carrier confinement at the interfaces, in quantum wells and in random short period superlattices existent in these nanowires, assuming a staggered band-offset between wurtzite and zinc-blende GaAs.
doc	Quantum Logspace Algorithm for Powering Matrices with Bounded Norm EOS We give a quantum logspace algorithm for powering contraction matrices, that is, matrices with spectral norm at most~1. EOS The algorithm gets as an input an arbitrary _EQN_ contraction matrix _EQN_, and a parameter _EQN_ and outputs the entries of _EQN_, up to (arbitrary) polynomially small additive error. EOS The algorithm applies only unitary operators, without intermediate measurements. EOS We show various implications and applications of this result: First, we use this algorithm to show that the class of quantum logspace algorithms with only quantum memory and with intermediate measurements is equivalent to the class of quantum logspace algorithms with only quantum memory without intermediate measurements. EOS This shows that the deferred-measurement principle, a fundamental principle of quantum computing, applies also for quantum logspace algorithms (without classical memory). EOS More generally, we give a quantum algorithm with space _EQN_ that takes as an input the description of a quantum algorithm with quantum space _EQN_ and time _EQN_, with intermediate measurements (without classical memory), and simulates it unitarily with polynomially small error, without intermediate measurements.	Since unitary transformations are reversible (while measurements are irreversible) an interesting aspect of this result is that it shows that any quantum logspace algorithm (without classical memory) can be simulated by a reversible quantum logspace algorithm.

doc	Effect of electron-nuclear spin interactions on electron-spin qubits localized in self-assembled quantum dots EOS The effect of electron-nuclear spin interactions on qubit operations is investigated for a qubit represented by the spin of an electron localized in a self-assembled quantum dot. EOS The localized electron wave function is evaluated within the atomistic tight-binding model. EOS The magnetic field generated by the nuclear spins is estimated in the presence of an inhomogeneous environment characterized by a random nuclear spin configuration, by the dot-size distribution, by alloy disorder, and by interface disorder. EOS Due to these inhomogeneities, the magnitude of the nuclear magnetic field varies from one qubit to another by the order of 100 G, 100 G, 10 G, and 0.1 G, respectively. EOS The fluctuation of the magnetic field causes errors in exchange operations due to the inequality of the Zeeman splitting between two qubits.	We show that the errors can be made lower than the quantum error threshold if an exchange energy larger than 0.1 meV is used for the operation.
doc	A unified theory of chaos linking nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics EOS A fundamental issue in nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics is how to distinguish chaotic from stochastic fluctuations in short experimental recordings. EOS This dilemma underlies many complex systems models from stochastic gene expression or stock exchange to quantum chaos. EOS Traditionally, deterministic chaos is characterized by "sensitive dependence on initial conditions" as indicated by a positive Lyapunov exponent. EOS However, ambiguity arises when applying this criterion to real-world data that are corrupted by measurement noise or perturbed nonautonomously by exogenous deterministic or stochastic inputs.	Here, we show that a positive Lyapunov exponent is surprisingly neither necessary nor sufficient proof of deterministic chaos, and that a nonlinear dynamical system under deterministic or stochastic forcing may exhibit multiple forms of nonautonomous chaos assessable by a noise titration assay.

doc	Deep morphological and spectral study of the SNR RCW 86 with Fermi-LAT EOS RCW 86 is a young supernova remnant (SNR) showing a shell-type structure at several wavelengths and is thought to be an efficient cosmic-ray (CR) accelerator. EOS Earlier \textit Fermi Large Area Telescope results reported the detection of _EQN_ -ray emission coincident with the position of RCW 86 but its origin (leptonic or hadronic) remained unclear due to the poor statistics. EOS Thanks to 6.5 years of data acquired by the \textit Fermi -LAT and the new event reconstruction Pass 8, we report the significant detection of spatially extended emission coming from RCW 86. EOS The spectrum is described by a power-law function with a very hard photon index (_EQN_) in the 0.1--500 GeV range and an energy flux above 100 MeV of (_EQN_ _EQN_ _EQN_ _EQN_ _EQN_) _EQN_ _EQN_ erg cm _EQN_ s _EQN_. EOS Gathering all the available multiwavelength (MWL) data, we perform a broadband modeling of the nonthermal emission of RCW 86 to constrain parameters of the nearby medium and bring new hints about the origin of the _EQN_ -ray emission.	For the whole SNR, the modeling favors a leptonic scenario in the framework of a two-zone model with an average magnetic field of 10.2 _EQN_ 0.7 _EQN_ G and a limit on the maximum energy injected into protons of 2 _EQN_ 10 _EQN_ erg for a density of 1 cm _EQN_.
doc	Structure of X-ray emitting jets close to the launching site: from embedded to disk-bearing sources EOS Several observations of stellar jets show evidence of X-ray emitting shocks close to the launching site. EOS In some cases, the shocked features appear to be stationary, also for YSOs at different stages of evolution. EOS We study the case of HH 154, the jet originating from the embedded binary Class 0/I protostar IRS 5, and the case of the jet associated to DG Tau, a more evolved Class II disk-bearing source or Classical T Tauri star (CTTS), both located in the Taurus star-forming region. EOS We aim at investigating the effect of perturbations in X-ray emitting stationary shocks in stellar jets; EOS the stability and detectability in X-rays of these shocks; EOS and explore the differences in jets from Class 0 to Class II sources. EOS We performed a set of 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations that modelled supersonic jets ramming into a magnetized medium. EOS The jet is formed by two components: a continously driven component that forms a quasi-stationary shock at the base of the jet; EOS and a pulsed component constituted by blobs perturbing the shock. EOS We explored different parameters for both components. EOS We studied two cases: a jet less dense than the ambient medium (light jet), representing the case of HH 154; EOS and a jet denser than the ambient (heavy jet), associated with DG Tau. EOS We synthesized the count rate from the simulations and compared with available Chandra observations. EOS Our model explains the formation of X-ray emitting quasi-stationary shocks observed at the base of jets in a natural way, being able to reproduce the observed jet properties at different evolutionary phases (in particular, for HH 154 and DG Tau).	The jet is collimated by the magnetic field forming a quasi-stationary shock at the base which emits in X-rays even when perturbations formed by a train of blobs are present.

doc	The Price of Political Uncertainty: Evidence from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the U.S. Stock Markets EOS There is bountiful evidence that political uncertainty stemming from presidential elections or doubt about the direction of future policy make financial markets significantly volatile, especially in proximity to close elections or elections that may prompt radical policy changes. EOS Although several studies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock returns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and election induced uncertainty on stock markets. EOS This paper explores, at sectoral level, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the reaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. EOS This hypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the elections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of the elections is determined (relative to post-election period). EOS To this end, we adopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around the election date. EOS We show that collapsing stock returns around the election result is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some cases where we note negative responses following the vote count. EOS Although Trump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal return are found.	Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.

EOS We say that a prime p divides X_a if p divides at least one term of the sequence. EOS It is easy to see that every prime p divides X_1, the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. EOS Lagarias, using a technique involving the computation of degrees of various Kummerian extensions first employed by Hasse, showed in 1985 that X_2, the set of primes dividing some Lucas number has natural density 2/3 and posed as a challenge finding the density of prime divisors of X_3.	In this paper we resolve this challenge, assuming GRH, by showing that the density of X_3 equals 1573727S/1569610, with S the so called Stephens constant.

doc	Observation of geometric parametric instability induced by the periodic spatial self-imaging of multimode waves EOS Spatio-temporal mode coupling in highly multimode physical systems permits new routes for exploring complex instabilities and forming coherent wave structures. EOS We present here the first experimental demonstration of multiple geometric parametric instability sidebands, generated in the frequency domain through resonant space-time coupling, owing to the natural periodic spatial self-imaging of a multimode quasi-continuous-wave beam in a standard graded-index multimode fiber. EOS The input beam was launched in the fiber by means of an amplified microchip laser emitting sub-nanosecond pulses at 1064 nm. EOS The experimentally observed frequency spacing among sidebands agrees well with analytical predictions and numerical simulations.	The first order peaks are located at the considerably large detuning of 123.5 THz from the pump.

doc	Distinguishing quantum features in classical propagation EOS The strictly classical propagation of an initial Wigner function, referred to as TWA or LSC-IVR, is considered to provide approximate averages, despite not being a true Wigner function: it does not represent a positive operator. EOS We here show that its symplectic Fourier transform, the truncated chord approximation (TCA), coincides with the full semiclassical approximation to the evolved quantum characteristic function (or chord function) in a narrow neighbourhood of the origin of the dual chord phase space.	Surprisingly, this small region accounts for purely quantum features, such as blind spots and local wave function correlations, as well as the expectation of observables with a close classical correspondence.

EOS Compared with our last review, there are numerous improvements: First, we have added 27 recently published measurements and eliminated 9 references; EOS of particular importance, the new data include a number of high-precision Penning-trap measurements of decay energies. EOS Second, we have used the recently improved isospin symmetry-breaking corrections. EOS Third, our calculation of the statistical rate function now accounts for possible excitation in the daughter atom.	Finally, we have re-examined the systematic uncertainty associated with the isospin symmetry-breaking corrections by evaluating the radial-overlap correction using Hartree-Fock radial wave functions and comparing the results with our earlier calculations, which used Saxon-Woods wave functions;
doc	CNN: Single-label to Multi-label EOS Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has demonstrated promising performance in single-label image classification tasks. EOS However, how CNN best copes with multi-label images still remains an open problem, mainly due to the complex underlying object layouts and insufficient multi-label training images. EOS In this work, we propose a flexible deep CNN infrastructure, called Hypotheses-CNN-Pooling (HCP), where an arbitrary number of object segment hypotheses are taken as the inputs, then a shared CNN is connected with each hypothesis, and finally the CNN output results from different hypotheses are aggregated with max pooling to produce the ultimate multi-label predictions. EOS Some unique characteristics of this flexible deep CNN infrastructure include: 1) no ground truth bounding box information is required for training;	2) the whole HCP infrastructure is robust to possibly noisy and/or redundant hypotheses;
doc	Accurate Identification of Galaxy Mergers with Imaging EOS Merging galaxies play a key role in galaxy evolution, and progress in our understanding of galaxy evolution is slowed by the difficulty of making accurate galaxy merger identifications. EOS We use GADGET-3 hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxies with the dust radiative transfer code SUNRISE to produce a suite of merging galaxies that span a range of initial conditions. EOS This includes simulated mergers that are gas poor and gas rich and that have a range of mass ratios (minor and major). EOS We adapt the simulated images to the specifications of the SDSS imaging survey and develop a merging galaxy classification scheme that is based on this imaging. EOS We leverage the strengths of seven individual imaging predictors (_EQN_, _EQN_, concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness, S\'ersic index, and shape asymmetry) by combining them into one classifier that utilizes Linear Discriminant Analysis. EOS It outperforms individual imaging predictors in accuracy, precision, and merger observability timescale (>2 Gyr for all merger simulations).	We find that the classification depends strongly on mass ratio and depends weakly on the gas fraction of the simulated mergers;

doc	Developing the Covariant Batalin-Vilkovisky approach to String Theory EOS We investigate the variation of the string field action under changes of the string field vertices giving rise to different decompositions of the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. EOS We establish that any such change in the string action arises from a field transformation canonical with respect to the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) antibracket, and find the explicit form of the generator of the infinitesimal transformations.	Two theories using different decompositions of moduli space are shown to yield the same gauge fixed action upon use of different gauge fixing conditions.

doc	A study of Schwinger-Dyson Equations for Yukawa and Wess-Zumino Models EOS We study Schwinger-Dyson equation for fermions in Yukawa and Wess-Zumino models, in terms of dynamical mass generation and the wavefunction renormalization function. EOS In the Yukawa model with _EQN_ -type interaction between scalars and fermions, we find a critical coupling in the quenched approximation above which fermions acquire dynamical mass. EOS This is shown to be true beyond the bare 3-point vertex approximation. EOS In the Wess-Zumino model, there is a neat cancellation of terms leading to no dynamical mass for fermions. EOS We comment on the conditions under which these results are general beyond the rainbow approximation and also on the ones under which supersymmetry is preserved and the scalars as well do not acquire mass.	The results are in accordance with the non-renormalization theorem at least to order _EQN_ in perturbation theory.

EOS It validates a diffusive model of osmosis that is distinct from the traditional convective flow model of osmosis. EOS Osmotic equilibrium occurs when the fraction of water molecules in solution matches the fraction of pure water molecules that have enough energy to overcome the pressure difference.	Solute-blocking also provides a kinetic explanation for why Raoult's law and the other colligative properties depend on the mole fraction (but not the size) of the solute particles, resulting in a novel kinetic explanation for the entropy of mixing and chemical potential of ideal solutions.

Configuration-interaction many-body perturbation theory (CI-MBPT) can treat efficiently valence-core correlations and relativistic effects, but because the formalism was developed for Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) starting potential that does not contain valence electrons, quite large CI space is needed to compensate for +6 charge of such a potential.

doc	Learning Deep Convolutional Features for MRI Based Alzheimer's Disease Classification EOS Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be critical for early treatment and thus has attracted more and more attention nowadays. EOS Since first introduced, machine learning methods have been gaining increasing popularity for AD related research. EOS Among the various identified biomarkers, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used for the prediction of AD or MCI. EOS However, before a machine learning algorithm can be applied, image features need to be extracted to represent the MRI images. EOS While good representations can be pivotal to the classification performance, almost all the previous studies typically rely on human labelling to find the regions of interest (ROI) which may be correlated to AD, such as hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus, etc. EOS This procedure requires domain knowledge and is costly and tedious.	Instead of relying on extraction of ROI features, it is more promising to remove manual ROI labelling from the pipeline and directly work on the raw MRI images.
doc	Theoretical Aspects of a Design Method for Programmable NMR Voters EOS Almost all dependable systems use some form of redundancy in order to increase fault-tolerance. EOS Very popular are the _EQN_ -Modular Redundant (NMR) systems in which a majority voter chooses the voting output. EOS However, elaborate systems require fault-tolerant voters which further give additional information besides the voting output, e.g., how many module outputs agree. EOS Dynamically defining which set of inputs should be considered for voting is also crucial. EOS Earlier we showed a practical implementation of programmable NMR voters that self-report the voting outcome and do self-checks. EOS Our voter design method uses a binary matrix with specific properties that enable easy scaling of the design regarding the number of voter inputs N. EOS Thus, an automated construction of NMR systems is possible, given the basic module and arbitrary redundancy _EQN_. EOS In this paper we present the mathematical aspects of the method, i.e., we analyze the properties of the matrix that characterizes the method. EOS We give the characteristic polynomials of the properly and erroneously built matrices in their explicit forms. EOS We further give their eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors, which reveal a lot of useful information about the system.	At the end, we give relations between the voter outputs and eigenpairs.
doc	Dilepton production and reaction dynamics in heavy-ion collisions at SIS energies from coarse-grained transport simulations EOS Dilepton invariant-mass spectra for heavy-ion collisions at SIS 18 and BEVALAC energies are calculated using a coarse-grained time evolution from the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model. EOS The coarse-graining of the microscopic simulations enables to calculate thermal dilepton emission rates by application of in-medium spectral functions from equilibrium quantum-field theoretical calculations. EOS The results show that extremely high baryon chemical potentials dominate the evolution of the created hot and dense fireball.	Consequently, a significant modification of the _EQN_ spectral shape becomes visible in the dilepton invariant-mass spectrum, resulting in an enhancement in the low-mass region _EQN_ to 600 MeV/ _EQN_.
doc	Automatic continuity, unique Polish topologies, and Zariski topologies (part I, monoids) EOS In this paper we explore the extent to which the algebraic structure of a monoid _EQN_ determines the topologies on _EQN_ that are compatible with its multiplication. EOS Specifically we study the notions of automatic continuity; EOS minimal Hausdorff or Polish semigroup topologies; EOS and we formulate a notion of the Zariski topology for monoids. EOS If _EQN_ is a topological monoid such that every homomorphism from _EQN_ to a second countable topological monoid _EQN_ is continuous, then we say that _EQN_ has ph automatic continuity. EOS We show that many well-known monoids have automatic continuity with respect to a natural semigroup topology, namely: the full transformation monoid _EQN_ ; EOS the full binary relation monoid _EQN_ ;	the partial transformation monoid _EQN_ ;

EOS Appearance of weak random magnetism over entire crystal volume has been revealed by a slow exponential relaxation.	The absence of _EQN_ -dependence for the random magnetism and the multiplet pattern of muon Knight shift at higher fields strongly suggest that the random moments are associated with excited Pr _EQN_ ions under crystal electric field.

doc	Drifting of the line-tied footpoints of CME flux-ropes EOS Existing 3D extensions to the standard model show that flux-rope footpoints are surrounded by curved-shaped QSL-footprints that can be related with hook-shaped flare-ribbons. EOS We build upon this finding and further address the joint questions of their time-evolution, and of the formation of flare loops at the ends of flaring PILs of the erupting bipole, which are both relevant for flare understanding in general and for ICME studies in particular. EOS We calculate QSLs and relevant field lines in an MHD simulation of a torus-unstable flux-rope. EOS The evolving QSL footprints are used to define the outer edge of the flux rope at different times, and to identify and characterize new 3D reconnection geometries and sequences that occur above the ends of the flaring PIL. EOS We also analyse flare-ribbons as observed in EUV by SDO/AIA and IRIS during two X-class flares. EOS The flux-rope footpoints are drifting during the eruption, which is unexpected due to line-tying. EOS This drifting is due to a series of coronal reconnections that erode the flux rope on one side and enlarge it on the other side. EOS Other changes in the flux-rope footpoint-area are due to multiple reconnections of individual field lines whose topology can evolve sequentially from arcade to flux rope and finally to flare loop. EOS These are associated with deformations and displacements of QSL footprints, which resemble those of the studied flare ribbons. EOS Our model predicts continuous deformations and a drifting of ICME flux-rope footpoints whose areas are surrounded by equally-evolving hooked-shaped flare-ribbons, as well as the formation of flare loops at the ends of flaring PILs which originate from the flux-rope itself, both of which being due to purely three-dimensional reconnection geometries.	The observed evolution of flare-ribbons in two events supports the model, but more observations are required to test all its predictions.

doc	Trust transitivity in social networks EOS Non-centralized recommendation-based decision making is a central feature of several social and technological processes, such as market dynamics, peer-to-peer file-sharing and the web of trust of digital certification. EOS We investigate the properties of trust propagation on networks, based on a simple metric of trust transitivity. EOS We investigate analytically the percolation properties of trust transitivity in random networks with arbitrary degree distribution, and compare with numerical realizations. EOS We find that the existence of a non-zero fraction of absolute trust (i.e. EOS entirely confident trust) is a requirement for the viability of global trust propagation in large systems: The average pair-wise trust is marked by a discontinuous transition at a specific fraction of absolute trust, below which it vanishes. EOS Furthermore, we perform an extensive analysis of the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) web of trust, in view of the concepts introduced. EOS We compare different scenarios of trust distribution: community- and authority-centered.	We find that these scenarios lead to sharply different patterns of trust propagation, due to the segregation of authority hubs and densely-connected communities.

doc	Black hole entropy from entanglement: A review EOS We review aspects of the thermodynamics of black holes and in particular take into account the fact that the quantum entanglement between the degrees of freedom of a scalar field, traced inside the event horizon, can be the origin of black hole entropy.	The main reason behind such a plausibility is that the well-known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area proportionality -- the so-called `area law' of black hole physics -- holds for entanglement entropy as well, provided the scalar field is in its ground state, or in other minimum uncertainty states, such as a generic coherent state or squeezed state.

doc	Unwinding motion of a twisted active-region filament EOS To better understand the structures of active-region filaments and the eruption process, we study an active-region filament eruption in active region NOAA 11082 in detail on June 22, 2010. EOS Before the filament eruption, the opposite unidirectional material flows appeared in succession along the spine of the filament. EOS The rising of the filament triggered two B-class flares at the upper part of the filament. EOS As the bright material was injected into the filament from the sites of the flares, the filament exhibited a rapid uplift accompanying the counterclockwise rotation of the filament body. EOS From the expansion of the filament, we can see that the filament is consisted of twisted magnetic field lines. EOS The total twist of the filament is at least 5 _EQN_ obtained by using time slice method. EOS According to the morphology change during the filament eruption, it is found that the active-region filament was a twisted flux rope and its unwinding motion was like a solar tornado. EOS We also find that there was a continuous magnetic helicity injection before and during the filament eruption.	It is confirmed that magnetic helicity can be transferred from the photosphere to the filament.

doc	Multi-pomeron exchange model for _EQN_ and _EQN_ collisions at ultra-high energy EOS A new variant of the effective pomeron exchange model is proposed for the description of the correlation, observed in _EQN_ and _EQN_ collisions at center-of-mass energy from SPS to LHC, between mean transverse momentum and charged particles multiplicity. EOS The model is based on the Regge-Gribov approach. EOS Smooth logarithmic growth with the collision energy was established for the parameter k, the mean rapidity density of charged particles produced by a single string. EOS It was obtained in the model by the fitting of the available experimental data on charged particles rapidity density in _EQN_ and _EQN_ collisions.	The main effect of the model, a gradual onset of string collectivity with the growth of collision energy, is accounted by a free parameter \beta that is responsible in an effective way for the string fusion phenomenon.

doc	B(H) lattices, density and arithmetic mean ideals EOS This part of a multi-paper project studies the lattice properties of the arithmetic mean ideals of B(H) introduced by Dykema, Figiel, Weiss, and Wodzicki. EOS We prove: the lattices of all principal ideals, of arithmetic mean or arithmetic mean at infinity stable principal ideals or of principal ideals with a generator that satisfies the Delta_1/2 condition, are all both upper and lower dense in the lattice of general ideals. EOS That is, between any ideal and an ideal (nested above or below respectively) in one of these sublattices, lies another ideal in that sublattice.	Among the applications: a principal ideal I is am-stable (I = I_a) if and only if any of its first order arithmetic mean ideals are am-stable if and only if the ideal satisfies the first order equality cancellation property: J_a = I_a implies J = I.
doc	Perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB multilayers with tunable interlayer exchange for synthetic ferrimagnets EOS A study of the multilayer system MgO/CoFeB(1.1nm)/Ta(_EQN_)/CoFeB(0.8nm)/MgO is presented, where the two CoFeB layers are separated by a Ta interlayer of varying thickness _EQN_. EOS The magnetization properties deduced from complementary techniques such as superconducting quantum interference magnetometry, ferromagnetic resonance frequency measurements and Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy can be tuned by changing the Ta thickness between _EQN_ =0.25 nm, 0.5 nm and 0.75 nm. EOS For _EQN_ =0.5 nm, a ferromagnetic coupling is observed, whereas for t=0.75 nm, the antiferromagnetic coupling needed to construct a synthetic ferrimagnet is realized. EOS In the later case, the shape of magnetic domain walls between two ferrimagnetic alignments or between a ferro- and a ferrimagnetic alignment is very different.	This behavior can be interpreted as a result of the change in dipolar as well as interlayer exchange energy and domain wall pinning, which is an important conclusion for the realization of data storage devices based on synthetic ferri- and antiferromagnets.

doc	Collective flow in (anti)proton-proton collision at Tevatron and LHC EOS Collective flow as a consequence of hydrodynamical evolution in heavy ion collisions is intensively studied by theorists and experimentalists to understand the behavior of hot quark matter. EOS Due to their large mass, heavy ions suffer collective effects even at low (SPS) or intermediate energies (RHIC). EOS In case of light systems such as (anti)proton-proton interactions, collective effects was not expected. EOS Within a global model such as EPOS, where light and heavy systems are treated using the same physics, it appears that Tevatron data are better described if a flow is introduced.	Then the extrapolation to LHC can easily be done and we can compare to first data from ATLAS experiment.
doc	Collisional Growth of Icy Dust Aggregates in Disk Formation Stage: Difficulties for Planetesimal Formation via Direct Collisional Growth outside the Snowline EOS Highly porous dust aggregates can break through the radial drift barrier, but previous studies assumed disks in their later stage, where the disks have a very small mass and low temperature.	In contrast, dust coagulation should begin in the very early stage such as the disk formation stage because the growth timescale of dust is shorter than the disk formation timescale if there is no process to suppress the collisional growth of dust.
doc	Noncommutative rational P\'olya series EOS A (noncommutative) P\'olya series over a field _EQN_ is a formal power series whose nonzero coefficients are contained in a finitely generated subgroup of _EQN_. EOS We show that rational P\'olya series are unambiguous rational series, proving a 40 year old conjecture of Reutenauer. EOS The proof combines methods from noncommutative algebra, automata theory, and number theory (specifically, unit equations). EOS As a corollary, a rational series is a P\'olya series if and only if it is Hadamard sub-invertible.	Phrased differently, we show that every weighted finite automaton taking values in a finitely generated subgroup of a field (and zero) is equivalent to an unambiguous weighted finite automaton.
doc	Asymptotic properties of functionals of increments of a continuous semimartingale with stochastic sampling times EOS This paper is concerned with asymptotic behavior of a variety of functionals of increments of continuous semimartingales. EOS Sampling times are assumed to follow a rather general discretization scheme. EOS If an underlying semimartingale is thought of as a financial asset price process, a general sampling scheme like the one employed in this paper is capable of reflecting what happens whenever the financial trading data are recorded in a tick-by-tick fashion.	A law of large numbers and a central limit theorem are proved after an appropriate normalization.
doc	Stability of superfluid phases in the 2D Spin-Polarized Attractive Hubbard Model EOS We study the evolution from the weak coupling (BCS-like limit) to the strong coupling limit of tightly bound local pairs (LP's) with increasing attraction, in the presence of the Zeeman magnetic field (_EQN_) for _EQN_, within the spin-polarized attractive Hubbard model. EOS The broken symmetry Hartree approximation as well as the strong coupling expansion are used. EOS We also apply the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) scenario to determine the phase coherence temperatures. EOS For spin independent hopping integrals (_EQN_), we find no stable homogeneous polarized superfluid (SC _EQN_) state in the ground state for the strong attraction and obtain that for a two-component Fermi system on a 2D lattice with population imbalance, phase separation (PS) is favoured for a fixed particle concentration, even on the LP (BEC) side. EOS We also examine the influence of spin dependent hopping integrals (mass imbalance) on the stability of the SC _EQN_ phase. EOS We find a topological quantum phase transition (Lifshitz type) from the unpolarized superfluid phase (SC _EQN_) to SC _EQN_ and tricritical points in the (_EQN_) and (_EQN_) ground state phase diagrams.	We also construct the finite temperature phase diagrams for both _EQN_ and _EQN_ and analyze the possibility of occurrence of a spin polarized KT superfluid.

EOS We explain why no sources of divergence are built into the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) Laplacian, whence there is no need to postulate any ad hoc conventions such as " _EQN_ " and " _EQN_ " within BV-approach to quantisation of gauge systems. EOS Remarkably, the geometry of iterated variations does not refer at all to the construction of Dirac's _EQN_ -function as a limit of smooth kernels.	We illustrate the reasoning by re-deriving - but not just "formally postulating" - the standard properties of BV-Laplacian and Schouten bracket and by verifying their basic inter-relations (e.g., cohomology preservation by gauge symmetries of the quantum master-equation).
doc	Pyroelectric Response in LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 to Temperature Changes EOS Measurements of the polarization charge accumulated at the -z and the +z bases of the pyroelectric crystals of LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 during changes in temperature are described. EOS An electrometer in the charge mode with its probe attached to the base under study was used. EOS A reference for the electrometer was established by grounding the electrometer probe at a specific crystal temperature, i.e., zeroing the electrometer. EOS When the ground is broken an induced charge, held captive by the polarization charge at the base of the crystal, remains in the probe circuit. EOS Then as the temperature of the crystal is changed the electrometer reads the change in the polarization charge with respect to the polarization charge at the zeroing temperature.	Data was obtained for each type of crystal and at the -z and +z bases for three different grounding conditions.

doc	Efficient Checking of Individual Rewards Properties in Markov Population Models EOS In recent years fluid approaches to the analysis of Markov populations models have been demonstrated to have great pragmatic value. EOS Initially developed to estimate the behaviour of the system in terms of the expected values of population counts, the fluid approach has subsequently been extended to more sophisticated interrogations of models through its embedding within model checking procedures.	In this paper we extend recent work on checking CSL properties of individual agents within a Markovian population model, to consider the checking of properties which incorporate rewards.
doc	On couplings to matter in massive (bi-)gravity EOS We investigate the coupling to matter in ghost-free massive (bi-)gravity. EOS When species in the matter sector couple covariantly to only one metric, we show that at one--loop these couplings do not spoil the special structure of the graviton potential. EOS When the same species couples directly to both metrics we show that a ghost is present at the classical level and that loops destroy the special structure of the potential at an unacceptably low scale. EOS We then propose a new `composite' effective metric built out of both metrics. EOS When matter fields couple covariantly to this effective metric, the would be Boulware--Deser ghost is absent in different representative limits. EOS At one--loop such couplings do not detune the special structure of the potential. EOS We conjecture that matter can couple covariantly to that effective metric in all generality without introducing any Boulware--Deser ghost below a cut-off scale parametrically larger than the strong coupling scale. EOS We also discuss alternative couplings to matter where the kinetic and potential terms of the matter field couple to different metrics.	In both cases we discuss preliminary implications for cosmology.

doc	Modelling Temporal Information Using Discrete Fourier Transform for Recognizing Emotions in User-generated Videos EOS With the widespread of user-generated Internet videos, emotion recognition in those videos attracts increasing research efforts. EOS However, most existing works are based on framelevel visual features and/or audio features, which might fail to model the temporal information, e.g. EOS characteristics accumulated along time. EOS In order to capture video temporal information, in this paper, we propose to analyse features in frequency domain transformed by discrete Fourier transform (DFT features). EOS Frame-level features are firstly extract by a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN). EOS Then, time domain features are transferred and interpolated into DFT features. EOS CNN and DFT features are further encoded and fused for emotion classification.	By this way, static image features extracted from a pre-trained deep CNN and temporal information represented by DFT features are jointly considered for video emotion recognition.

doc	Fourier Power Function Shapelets (FPFS) Shear Estimator: Performance on Image Simulations EOS We reinterpret the shear estimator developed by Zhang & Komatsu (2011) within the framework of Shapelets and propose the Fourier Power Function Shapelets (FPFS) shear estimator. EOS Four shapelet modes are calculated from the power function of every galaxy's Fourier transform after deconvolving the Point Spread Function (PSF) in Fourier space. EOS We propose a novel normalization scheme to construct dimensionless ellipticity and its corresponding shear responsivity using these shapelet modes.	Shear is measured in a conventional way by averaging the ellipticities and responsivities over a large ensemble of galaxies.
doc	Accurate mass and velocity functions of dark matter halos EOS _EQN_ -body cosmological simulations are an essential tool to understand the observed distribution of galaxies. EOS We use the MultiDark simulation suite, run with the Planck cosmological parameters, to revisit the mass and velocity functions. EOS At redshift _EQN_, the simulations cover four orders of magnitude in halo mass from _EQN_ with 8,783,874 distinct halos and 532,533 subhalos. EOS The total volume used is _EQN_ 515 Gpc _EQN_, more than 8 times larger than in previous studies. EOS We measure and model the halo mass function, its covariance matrix w.r.t halo mass and the large scale halo bias. EOS With the formalism of the excursion-set mass function, we explicit the tight interconnection between the covariance matrix, bias and halo mass function. EOS We obtain a very accurate (_EQN_ level) model of the distinct halo mass function. EOS We also model the subhalo mass function and its relation to the distinct halo mass function. EOS The set of models obtained provides a complete and precise framework for the description of halos in the concordance Planck cosmology.	Finally, we provide precise analytical fits of the _EQN_ maximum velocity function up to redshift _EQN_ to push for the development of halo occupation distribution using _EQN_.
doc	Accelerated Expansion as Predicted by an Ether Theory of Gravitation EOS Cosmology is investigated within a new, scalar theory of gravitation, which is a preferred-frame bimetric theory with flat background metric. EOS Before coming to cosmology, the motivation for an " ether theory " is exposed at length; EOS the investigated concept of ether is presented: it is a compressible fluid, and gravity is seen as Archimedes' thrust due to the pressure gradient in that fluid. EOS The construction of the theory is explained and the current status of the experimental confrontation is analysed, both in some detail. EOS An analytical cosmological solution is obtained for a general form of the energy-momentum tensor. EOS According to that theory, expansion is necessarily accelerated, both by vacuum and even by matter. EOS In one case, the theory predicts expansion, the density increasing without limit as time goes back to infinity. EOS High density is thus obtained in the past, without a big-bang singularity. EOS In the other case, the Universe follows a sequence of (non-identical) contraction-expansion cycles, each with finite maximum energy density; EOS the current expansion phase will end by infinite dilution in some six billions of years.	The density ratio of the present cycle (ratio of the maximum to current densities) is not determined by the current density and the current Hubble constant H0, unless a special assumption is made.
doc	Modeling quasi-dark states with Temporal Coupled-Mode Theory EOS Coupled resonators are commonly used to achieve tailored spectral responses and allow novel functionalities in a broad range of applications, from optical modulation and filtering in integrated photonic circuits to the study of nonlinear dynamics in arrays of resonators. EOS The Temporal Coupled-Mode Theory (TCMT) provides a simple and general tool that is widely used to model these devices and has proved to yield very good results in many different systems of low-loss, weakly coupled resonators.	Relying on TCMT to model coupled resonators might however be misleading in some circumstances due to the lumped-element nature of the model.
doc	Constraints on the velocity dispersion of Dark Matter from Cosmology and new bounds on scattering from the Cosmic Dawn EOS The observational value of the velocity dispersion, _EQN_, is missing in the Dark Matter (DM) puzzle. EOS Non-zero or non-thermal DM velocities can drastically influence Large Scale Structure and the 21-cm temperature at the epoch of the Cosmic Dawn, as well as the estimation of DM physical parameters, such as the mass and the interaction couplings. EOS To study the phenomenology of _EQN_ we model the evolution of DM in terms of a simplistic and generic Boltzmann-like momentum distribution. EOS Using cosmological data from the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and Red Luminous Galaxies, we constrain the DM velocity dispersion for a broad range of masses _EQN_, finding _EQN_ 0.33 km/s (99% CL). EOS Including the EDGES _EQN_ -measurements, we extend our study to constrain the baryon-DM interaction in the range of DM velocities allowed by our analysis. EOS As a consequence, we present new bounds on two electromagnetic models of DM, namely minicharged particles (MCPs) and electric dipole moment (EDM). EOS For MCPs, the parameter region that is consistent with EDGES and independent bounds on cosmological and stellar physics is very small, pointing to the sub-eV mass regime of DM.	A window in the MeV-GeV may still be compatible with these bounds for MCP models without a hidden photon.
doc	Deep Encoder, Shallow Decoder: Reevaluating the Speed-Quality Tradeoff in Machine Translation EOS State-of-the-art neural machine translation models generate outputs autoregressively, where every step conditions on the previously generated tokens. EOS This sequential nature causes inherent decoding latency. EOS Non-autoregressive translation techniques, on the other hand, parallelize generation across positions and speed up inference at the expense of translation quality. EOS Much recent effort has been devoted to non-autoregressive methods, aiming for a better balance between speed and quality. EOS In this work, we re-examine the trade-off and argue that transformer-based autoregressive models can be substantially sped up without loss in accuracy. EOS Specifically, we study autoregressive models with encoders and decoders of varied depths.	Our extensive experiments show that given a sufficiently deep encoder, a one-layer autoregressive decoder yields state-of-the-art accuracy with comparable latency to strong non-autoregressive models.

doc	Restoration of the Derivative Discontinuity in Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory: An Efficient Scheme for Energy Gap Correction EOS From the perspective of perturbation theory, we propose a systematic procedure for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity (DD) of the exchange-correlation energy functional in Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), wherein the exact DD can in principle be obtained by summing up all the perturbation corrections to infinite order. EOS Truncation of the perturbation series at low order yields an efficient scheme for obtaining the approximate DD.	While the zeroth-order theory yields a vanishing DD, the first-order correction to the DD can be expressed as an explicit universal functional of the ground-state density and the KS lowest unoccupied molecular orbital density, allowing the direct evaluation of the DD in the standard KS method without extra computational cost.

doc	SU(2N_F) hidden symmetry of QCD EOS Recently a global SU(4) \supset SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_A symmetry of the confining Coulombic part of the QCD Hamiltonian has been discovered with N_F=2. EOS This global symmetry includes both independent rotations of the left- and right-handed quarks in the isospin space as well as the chiralspin rotations that mix the left- and right-handed components of the quark fields.	It has been suggested by lattice simulations, however, that a symmetry of mesons in the light quark sector upon the quasi-zero mode truncation from the quark propagators is actually higher than SU(4), because the states from a singlet and a 15-plet irreducible representations of SU(4) are also degenerate.

EOS In this paper, the thermal expansion behavior of metal indium has been studied by using the in-situ XRD technique with the Mythen detector. EOS The indium film was heated from 30 to 160 \deg C with a heating rate of 2 \deg C/min. EOS The in-situ XRD full-profiles were collected with a rate of one profile per 10 seconds.	Rietveld refinement was used to extract the structural parameters.

EOS The Kugo-Ojima criterion of colour confinement in the BRS formulation of the continuum gauge theory is given by _EQN_, where _EQN_ is defined by the two point function of the Faddeev-Popov ghost fields _EQN_ and the gauge field _EQN_. EOS We measured the lattice version of _EQN_ in use of _EQN_ where _EQN_ is a lattice covariant derivative in the new definition of the gauge fields as _EQN_.

doc	Calorimetric glass transition explained by hierarchical dynamic facilitation EOS The glass transition refers to the non-equilibrium process by which an equilibrium liquid is transformed to a non-equilibrium disordered solid, or vice versa. EOS Associated response functions, such as heat capacities, are markedly different on cooling than on heating, and the response to melting a glass depends markedly on the cooling protocol by which the glass was formed. EOS This paper shows how this irreversible behavior can be interpreted quantitatively in terms of an East-model picture of localized excitations (or soft spots) in which molecules can move with a specific direction, and from which excitations with the same directionality of motion can appear or disappear in adjacent regions. EOS As a result of this facilitated dynamics, excitations become correlated in a hierarchical fashion. EOS These correlations are manifested in the dynamic heterogeneity of the supercooled liquid phase.	While equilibrium thermodynamics is virtually featureless, a non-equilibrium glass phase emerges when the model is driven out of equilibrium with a finite cooling rate.

EOS The methods include, in addition to Hurewicz's game theoretic characterization of Menger's property, extensions of the classic idempotent theory in the Stone--Czech compactification of semigroups, and of the more recent theory of selection principles. EOS This provides strong versions of the mentioned celebrated theorems, where the monochromatic substructures are large, beyond infinitude, in an analytic sense. EOS Reducing the main theorems to the purely combinatorial setting, we obtain nontrivial consequences concerning uncountable cardinal characteristics of the continuum. EOS The main results, modulo technical refinements, are of the following type (definitions provided in the main text): Let _EQN_ be a Menger space, and _EQN_ be an infinite open cover of _EQN_. EOS Consider the complete graph, whose vertices are the open sets in _EQN_. EOS For each finite coloring of the vertices and edges of this graph, there are disjoint finite subsets _EQN_ of the cover _EQN_ whose unions _EQN_ have the following properties: 1. EOS The sets _EQN_ and _EQN_ are distinct for all nonempty finite sets _EQN_. EOS 2.	All vertices _EQN_, for nonempty finite sets _EQN_, are of the same color.

We propose an approximate solution based on our theoretical findings that would borrow techniques from approximate dynamic programming.

doc	Pattern Matching and Classification of Clusters in Collision Cascades EOS The structure of defect clusters formed in a displacement cascade plays a significant role in the micro-structural evolution during irradiation. EOS Molecular dynamics simulations have been widely used to study collision cascades and subsequent clustering of defects. EOS We present a novel method to pattern match and classify defect clusters. EOS A cluster is characterized by the geometrical and topological histograms of its angles and distances which can then be used as similarity metrics. EOS The technique is demonstrated by matching similar clusters for different cluster shapes like ring, crowdions etc. EOS in a database of cascade damage configurations in Fe and W at different energies. EOS We further use graph based dimensionality reduction techniques and unsupervised machine learning on the features of all the clusters present in the database to find classes of clusters. EOS The classification successfully separates out many already known categories of clusters such as crowdions, planar crowdion pairs, rings and perpendicular crowdions. EOS The dimensionality and size of different classes provides a broad categorization of classes. EOS The distribution of different classes of shapes among cascades of different elements and energies shows the exclusivity of shapes to elements and energies. EOS We discuss the key points and computational efficiency of the algorithms along with the various prominent results of their application. EOS We discuss the motivation for using machine learning and statistics for the problems and compare different techniques.	The algorithms along with the supporting analysis and visualizations give an unsupervised approach for classification and study of defect clusters in cascades.

EOS An existing single-resonance model with S11, P11 and P13 Breit-Wiegner resonances in the s-channel has been applied. EOS It has been shown that the standard set of resonant parameters fails to reproduce the shape of the differential cross section. EOS The new resonance parameter determination has been performed keeping in mind the most recent knowledge about nucleon resonances.

EOS Fast-moving knots (FMK) in the Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A consist mainly of metals and allow to study element production in supernovae and shock physics in great detail. EOS Aims. EOS We work out theoretically and suggest to observe previously unexplored class of spectral lines -- metal recombination lines in optical and near-infrared bands -- emitted by the cold ionized and cooling plasma in the fast-moving knots. EOS Methods. EOS By tracing ion radiative and dielectronic recombination, collisional _EQN_ -redistribution and radiative cascade processes, we compute resulting oxygen, silicon and sulphur recombination line emissivities. EOS It allows us to determine the oxygen recombination line fluxes, based on the fast-moving knot model of Sutherland and Dopita (1995b), that predicts existence of highly-ionized ions from moderate to very low plasma temperatures. EOS Results. EOS The calculations predict oxygen ion recombination line fluxes detectable on modern optical telescopes in the wavelength range from 0.5 to 3 microns.	Line ratios to collisionally-excited lines will allow to probe in detail the process of rapid cloud cooling after passage of a shock front, to test high abundances of O V and O VI ions at low temperatures and measure them, to test existing theoretical models of a FMK and to build more precise ones.
doc	Optical approximation in the theory of geometric impedance EOS In this paper we introduce an optical approximation into the theory of impedance calculation, one valid in the limit of high frequencies. EOS This approximation neglects diffraction effects in the radiation process, and is conceptually equivalent to the approximation of geometric optics in electromagnetic theory. EOS Using this approximation, we derive equations for the longitudinal impedance for arbitrary offsets, with respect to a reference orbit, of source and test particles. EOS With the help of the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem we also obtain expressions for the transverse impedance (also for arbitrary offsets). EOS We further simplify these expressions for the case of the small offsets that are typical for practical applications.	Our final expressions for the impedance, in the general case, involve two dimensional integrals over various cross-sections of the transition.
doc	Testing the nature of the supermassive black hole candidate in SgrA* with light curves and images of hot spots EOS General relativity makes clear predictions about the spacetime geometry around black holes. EOS In the near future, new facilities will have the capability to explore the metric around SgrA _EQN_, the supermassive black hole candidate at the Center of our Galaxy, and open a new window to test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. EOS In this paper, we compute light curves and images associated with compact emission regions (hot spots) orbiting around Kerr and non-Kerr black holes. EOS We study how the analysis of the properties of the radiation emitted by a hot spot can be used to test the Kerr nature of SgrA _EQN_. EOS We find that the sole observation of the hot spot light curve can at most constrain a combination of the black hole spin and of possible deviations from the Kerr solution. EOS This happens because the same orbital frequency around a Kerr black hole can be found for a non-Kerr object with a different spin parameter. EOS Second order corrections in the light curve due to the background geometry are typically too small to be identified.	While the observation of the hot spot centroid track can potentially bound possible deviations from the Kerr solution, that is out of reach for the near future VLTI instrument GRAVITY.

Depending on the deepness of the social contacts, which will be characterized by a parameter _EQN_, a stable distribution of party members emerges.
doc	Variable Smoothing Lengths and Energy Conservation in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics EOS We present a new formulation of the equations of motion used in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). EOS The spatial resolution in SPH is determined by the smoothing length, _EQN_, and it has become common practice for each particle to be given its own adaptive smoothing length, _EQN_. EOS Consequently, the dynamic range that may be spatially resolved is greatly increased, but additional (_EQN_) terms, which account for the variability of the smoothing lengths, should appear in the equations of motion in order to satisy conservation requirements.	Previous implementations of SPH have neglected these additional terms, whereas we have included them.

EOS Such types of conditions are for example considered in the Spanish and Portuguese day-ahead markets. EOS This helps describing the recovery of start-up costs of a power plant, or analogously for a large consumer, utility reduced by a constant term. EOS A new market model is proposed with a corresponding MILP formulation for uniform locational price day-ahead auctions, handling bids with a minimum profit or maximum payment condition in a uniform and computationally-efficient way.	An exact decomposition procedure with sparse strengthened Benders cuts derived from the MILP formulation is also proposed.

EOS We study the forward shock in the oxygen-rich young supernova remnant (SNR) 1E0102.2-7219 (1E0102 in short) via optical coronal emission from [Fe XIV] and [Fe XI]: emission lines which offer an alternative method to X-rays to do so. EOS Methods. EOS We have used the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) optical integral field spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on Cerro Paranal to obtain deep observations of SNR 1E0102 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. EOS Our observations cover the entire extent of the remnant with a seeing limited spatial resolution of 0.7" = 0.2 pc at the distance of 1E 0102. EOS Results. EOS Our MUSE observations unambiguously reveal the presence of [Fe XIV] and [Fe XI] emission in 1E0102. EOS The emission largely arises from a thin, partial ring of filaments surrounding the fast moving O-rich ejecta in the system. EOS The brightest [Fe XIV] and [Fe XI] emission is found along the eastern and north-western sides of 1E0102, where shocks are driven into denser ISM material, while fainter emission along the northern edge reveals the location of the forward shock in lower density gas, possibly the relic stellar wind cavity.	Modeling of the eastern shocks and the photoionization precursor surrounding 1E0102, we derive a pre-shock density _EQN_ = (7.4 +-1.5) cm _EQN_, and a shock velocity 330 km/s < _EQN_ < 350 km/s.
doc	Hill stability in the AMD framework EOS In a two-planet system, due to Sundman (1912) inequality, a topological boundary can forbid close encounters between the two planets for infinite time. EOS A system is said Hill stable if it verifies this topological condition. EOS Hill stability is widely used in the study of extra solar planets dynamics. EOS However people often use the coplanar and circular orbits approximation. EOS In this paper, we explain how the Hill stability can be understood in the framework of Angular Momentum Deficit (AMD).	In the secular approximation, the AMD allows to discriminate between a priori stable systems and systems for which a more in depth dynamical analysis is required.
doc	Simulation of longitudinal dynamics of laser-cooled and RF-bunched C _EQN_ ion beams at heavy ion storage ring CSRe EOS Laser cooling of relativistic heavy ion beams of Li-like C _EQN_ and O _EQN_ is being in preparation at the experimental Cooler Storage Ring (CSRe). EOS Recently, a preparatory experiment to test important prerequisites for laser cooling of relativistic _EQN_ C _EQN_ ion beams using a pulsed laser system has been performed at the CSRe.	Unfortunately, the interaction between the ions and the pulsed laser cannot be detected.
doc	S-PASS/ATCA: a window on the magnetic universe in the southern hemisphere EOS We present S-PASS/ATCA, the first wide-band radio polarimetry survey of compact sources in the southern sky. EOS We describe how we selected targets for observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in the 16 cm band (1.3 - 3.1 GHz), our observing and calibration strategy, how we analysed the data, and how we tested the quality of the data. EOS The data are made publicly available. EOS The survey contains on average one source per five square degrees and has an angular resolution at 2.2 GHz of ~ 2'x1'. EOS Sources with |RM|s > 150 rad m-2 are seen towards the Galactic plane and bright Hii regions, but are rare elsewhere on the sky. EOS Sightlines that are separated by up to 3' show very similar RMs. EOS Based on this observation, we argue that the Galactic foreground is the dominant contributor to RM, confirming previous results, and that the sources must have very simple distributions of Faraday-rotating and synchrotron-emitting media. EOS Many sources that emit at a single RM have a spectral index in linear polarization that is (very) different from the spectral index in Stokes I.	Analysing ratios of flux densities Q/I and U/I (to correct for spectral index effects) then leads to erroneous results.

doc	Implications of the mass _EQN_ M _EQN_ of PSR~J0740+6620 on the Equation of State of Super-Dense Neutron-Rich Nuclear Matter EOS We study implications of the very recently reported mass _EQN_ M _EQN_ of PSR~J0740+6620 on the Equation of State (EOS) of super-dense neutron-rich nuclear matter with respect to existing constraints on the EOS based on the mass _EQN_ M _EQN_ of PSR~J0348+0432, the maximum tidal deformability of GW170817 and earlier results of various terrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments.	The lower limit of the skewness _EQN_ measuring the stiffness of super-dense isospin-symmetric nuclear matter is raised raised from about -220 MeV to -150 MeV, reducing significantly its current uncertainty range.
doc	Unconventional Ideas for Ionization Cooling of Muons EOS Small muon beams increase the luminosity of a muon collider. EOS Reducing the momentum and position spreads of muons reduces emittance and leads to small, cool beams. EOS Ionization cooling has been observed at the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment. EOS 6D emittance reduction by a factor of 100, 000 has been achieved in simulation. EOS Another factor of 5 in cooling would meet the basic requirements of a high luminosity muon collider. EOS In this paper we compare, for the first time, the amount of RF needed in a cooling channel to previous linacs.	We also outline three methods aimed to help achieve a final factor of 5 in 6D cooling.
doc	Estimates of Active Region Area Coverage through Simultaneous Measurements of He I _EQN_ 5876 and 10830 Lines EOS Simultaneous, high-quality measurements of the neutral helium triplet features at 5876~\AA\ and 10830~\AA, respectively, in a sample of solar-type stars are presented. EOS The observations were made with ESO telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under program ID 088.D-0028(A) and MPG Utility Run for FEROS 088.A-9029(A). EOS The equivalent widths of these features combined with chromospheric models are utilized to infer the fractional area coverage, or filling factor, of magnetic regions outside of spots. EOS We find that the majority of the sample is characterized by filling factors less than unity. EOS However, discrepancies occur among the coolest K-type and warmest and most rapidly rotating F-type dwarf stars. EOS We discuss these apparently anomalous results and find that in the case of K-type stars they are an artifact of the application of chromospheric models best suited to the Sun than to stars with significantly lower _EQN_. EOS The case of the F-type rapid rotators can be explained with the measurement uncertainties of the equivalent widths, but they may also be due to a non-magnetic heating component in their atmospheres. EOS With the exceptions noted above, preliminary results suggest that the average heating rates in the active regions are the same from one star to the other, differing in the spatially integrated, observed level of activity due to the area coverage.	Hence, differences in activity in this sample are mainly due to the filling factor of active regions.
doc	On conformal supergravity and projective superspace EOS The projective superspace formulation for four-dimensional N = 2 matter-coupled supergravity presented in arXiv:0805.4683 makes use of the variant superspace realization for the N = 2 Weyl multiplet in which the structure group is SL(2,C) x SU(2) and the super-Weyl transformations are generated by a covariantly chiral parameter. EOS An extension to Howe's realization of N = 2 conformal supergravity in which the tangent space group is SL(2,C) x U(2) and the super-Weyl transformations are generated by a real unconstrained parameter was briefly sketched.	Here we give the explicit details of the extension.
doc	Blurring the Line Between Structure and Learning to Optimize and Adapt Receptive Fields EOS The visual world is vast and varied, but its variations divide into structured and unstructured factors. EOS We compose free-form filters and structured Gaussian filters, optimized end-to-end, to factorize deep representations and learn both local features and their degree of locality. EOS Our semi-structured composition is strictly more expressive than free-form filtering, and changes in its structured parameters would require changes in free-form architecture. EOS In effect this optimizes over receptive field size and shape, tuning locality to the data and task. EOS Dynamic inference, in which the Gaussian structure varies with the input, adapts receptive field size to compensate for local scale variation. EOS Optimizing receptive field size improves semantic segmentation accuracy on Cityscapes by 1-2 points for strong dilated and skip architectures and by up to 10 points for suboptimal designs.	Adapting receptive fields by dynamic Gaussian structure further improves results, equaling the accuracy of free-form deformation while improving efficiency.
doc	Sampling Almost Periodic and related Functions EOS We consider certain finite sets of circle-valued functions defined on intervals of real numbers and estimate how large the intervals must be for the values of these functions to be uniformly distributed in an approximate way. EOS This is used to establish some general conditions under which a random construction introduced by Katznelson for the integers yields sets that are dense in the Bohr group.	We obtain in this way very sparse sets of real numbers (and of integers) on which two different almost periodic functions cannot agree, what makes them amenable to be used in sampling theorems for these functions.
doc	Naked Singularities in Spherically Symmetric, Self-Similar Spacetimes EOS We show that all known naked singularities in spherically symmetric self-similar spacetimes arise as a result of singular initial matter distribution.	This is a result of the peculiarity of the coordinate transformation that takes these spacetimes into a separable form.
doc	Topology and Sizes of HII Regions during Cosmic Reionization EOS We use the results of large-scale simulations of reionization to explore methods for characterizing the topology and sizes of HII regions during reionization. EOS We use four independent methods for characterizing the sizes of ionized regions. EOS Three of them give us a full size distribution: the friends-of-friends (FOF) method, the spherical average method (SPA) and the power spectrum (PS) of the ionized fraction. EOS These latter three methods are complementary: While the FOF method captures the size distribution of the small scale H II regions, which contribute only a small amount to the total ionization fraction, the spherical average method provides a smoothed measure for the average size of the H II regions constituting the main contribution to the ionized fraction, and the power spectrum does the same while retaining more details on the size distribution. EOS Our fourth method for characterizing the sizes of the H II regions is the average size which results if we divide the total volume of the H II regions by their total surface area, (i.e. EOS 3V/A), computed in terms of the ratio of the corresponding Minkowski functionals of the ionized fraction field. EOS To characterize the topology of the ionized regions, we calculate the evolution of the Euler Characteristic. EOS We find that the evolution of the topology during the first half of reionization is consistent with inside-out reionization of a Gaussian density field.	We use these techniques to investigate the dependence of size and topology on some basic source properties, such as the halo mass-to-light ratio, susceptibility of haloes to negative feedback from reionization, and the minimum halo mass for sources to form.
doc	Rooting out the Rumor Culprit from Suspects EOS Suppose that a rumor originating from a single source among a set of suspects spreads in a network, how to root out this rumor source?	With the a priori knowledge of suspect nodes and an observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the susceptible-infected (SI) model.
doc	The Dynamical Evolution of the Asteroid Belt EOS The asteroid belt is the leftover of the original planetesimal population in the inner solar system. EOS However, currently the asteroids have orbits with all possible values of eccentricities and inclinations compatible with long-term dynamical stability, whereas the initial planetesimal orbits should have been quasi-circular and almost co-planar.	The total mass in the asteroid population is a small fraction of that existing primordially.
doc	Extracting dark matter signatures from atomic clock stability measurements EOS We analyze possible effects of the dark matter environment on the atomic clock stability measurements. EOS The dark matter is assumed to exist in a form of waves of ultralight scalar fields or in a form of topological defects (monopoles and strings). EOS We identify dark matter signal signatures in clock Allan deviation plots that can be used to constrain the dark matter coupling to the Standard Model fields.	The existing data on the Al+/Hg+ clock comparison are used to put new limits on the dilaton dark matter in the region of masses m > 10^ -15 eV.
doc	The Universal Composable Security of Quantum Message Authentication with Key Recyling EOS Barnum, Crepeau, Gottesman, Tapp, and Smith (quant-ph/0205128) proposed methods for authentication of quantum messages. EOS The first method is an interactive protocol (TQA') based on teleportation. EOS The second method is a noninteractive protocol (QA) in which the sender first encrypts the message using a protocol QEnc and then encodes the quantum ciphertext with an error correcting code chosen secretly from a set (a purity test code (PTC)). EOS Encryption was shown to be necessary for authentication. EOS We augment the protocol QA with an extra step which recycles the entire encryption key provided QA accepts the message. EOS We analyze the resulting integrated protocol for quantum authentication and key generation, which we call QA+KG. EOS Our main result is a proof that QA+KG is universal composably (UC) secure in the Ben-Or-Mayers model (quant-ph/0409062). EOS More specifically, this implies the UC-security of (a) QA, (b) recycling of the encryption key in QA, and (c) key-recycling of the encryption scheme QEnc by appending PTC. EOS For an m-qubit message, encryption requires 2m bits of key;	but PTC can be performed using only O(log m) + O(log e) bits of key for probability of failure e.
doc	Linear Parameter Varying Representation of a class of MIMO Nonlinear Systems EOS Linear parameter-varying (LPV) models form a powerful model class to analyze and control a (nonlinear) system of interest. EOS Identifying an LPV model of a nonlinear system can be challenging due to the difficulty of selecting the scheduling variable(s) a priori, especially if a first principles based understanding of the system is unavailable. EOS Converting a nonlinear model to an LPV form is also non-trivial and requires systematic methods to automate the process. EOS Inspired by these challenges, a systematic LPV embedding approach starting from multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) linear fractional representations with a nonlinear feedback block (NLFR) is proposed. EOS This NLFR model class is embedded into the LPV model class by an automated factorization of the (possibly MIMO) static nonlinear block present in the model. EOS As a result of the factorization, an LPV-LFR or an LPV state-space model with affine dependency on the scheduling is obtained. EOS This approach facilitates the selection of the scheduling variable and the connected mapping of system variables. EOS Such a conversion method enables to use nonlinear identification tools to estimate LPV models.	The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated on a 2-DOF nonlinear mass-spring-damper example.
doc	Kinematics of AGN and Quasar Jets EOS The major multi-epoch VLBA programs are described and discussed in terms of relativistic beaming models. EOS Broadly speaking the observed kinematics are consistent with models having a parent population which is only mildly relativistic but with Lorentz factors extending up to about 30. EOS While the collimation and acceleration appears to mainly occur close to the central engine, there is evidence of accelerations up to 1 kpc downstream. EOS Generally the motion appears to be linear, but in some sources the motion follows a curved trajectory. EOS In other sources, successive features appear to be ejected in different directions possibly the result of a precessing nozzle.	The launch of GLAST in 2008 will offer new opportunities to study the relation between radio and gamma-ray activity, and possibly to locate the source of the gamma-ray emission.

doc	Gradient-Induced Co-Saliency Detection EOS Co-saliency detection (Co-SOD) aims to segment the common salient foreground in a group of relevant images. EOS In this paper, inspired by human behavior, we propose a gradient-induced co-saliency detection (GICD) method. EOS We first abstract a consensus representation for the grouped images in the embedding space; EOS then, by comparing the single image with consensus representation, we utilize the feedback gradient information to induce more attention to the discriminative co-salient features.	In addition, due to the lack of Co-SOD training data, we design a jigsaw training strategy, with which Co-SOD networks can be trained on general saliency datasets without extra pixel-level annotations.

EOS This work develops image reconstruction methods with deep learning (DL) regularization for LDCT. EOS Our methods are based on unrolling of proximal forward-backward splitting (PFBS) framework with data-driven image regularization via deep neural networks.	In contrast with PFBS-IR that utilizes standard data fidelity updates via iterative reconstruction (IR) method, PFBS-AIR involves preconditioned data fidelity updates that fuse analytical reconstruction (AR) method and IR in a synergistic way, I.e.

doc	Tunable degree of localization in random lasers with controlled interaction EOS We show that the degree of localization for the modes of a random laser (RL) is affected by the inter mode interaction that is controlled by shaping the spot of the pump laser. EOS By experimentally investigating the spatial properties of the lasing emission we infer that strongly localized modes are activated in the low interacting regime while in the strongly interacting one extended modes are found lasing.	Thus we demonstrate that the degree o localization may be finely tuned at the micrometer level.

EOS We use _EQN_ _EQN_ -pairs accumulated on the \upsfs resonance at PEP-II. EOS In this analysis we use the decay mode _EQN_ and its charge conjugate.	The _EQN_ is reconstructed in the channel _EQN_ and the _EQN_ in the channel _EQN_.

The masses and charges are also explicitly shown to satisfy the non-threshold bound of 1/2 BPS objects.

doc	Colloidal gels assembled via a temporary interfacial scaffold EOS The liquid-liquid phase separation of a binary solvent can be arrested by colloidal particles trapped at the interface [K. EOS Stratford et al, Science 309, 5744 (2005)]. EOS We show experimentally that the colloidal network so formed can remain stable after fully remixing the liquids, creating a new type of gel in which colloids in a single-phase solvent have locally planar coordination. EOS We argue that this structure is likely maintained by primary-minimum DLVO bonding of our charged colloids, created under strong compression by capillary forces.	We present simulation evidence that the combination of a short-ranged attraction with a repulsive barrier can strongly stabilize such locally planar gels.

doc	The Magnetic Classification of Solar Active Regions 1992 - 2015 EOS The purpose of this letter is to address a blind-spot in our knowledge of solar active region statistics. EOS To the best of our knowledge there are no published results showing the variation of the Mount Wilson magnetic classifications as a function of solar cycle based on modern observations. EOS We show statistics for all active regions reported in the daily Solar Region Summary from 1992 January 1 to 2015 December 31. EOS We find that the _EQN_ and _EQN_ class active regions (including all sub-groups e.g. EOS _EQN_, _EQN_) make up fractions of approximately 20% and 80% of the sample respectively.	This fraction is relatively constant during high levels of activity, however, an increase in the _EQN_ fraction to about 35% and and a decrease in the _EQN_ fraction to about 65% can be seen near each solar minimum and is statistically significant at the 2- _EQN_ level.

doc	More than just halo mass: Modelling how the red galaxy fraction depends on multiscale density in a HOD framework EOS The fraction of galaxies with red colours depends sensitively on environment, and on the way in which environment is measured. EOS To distinguish competing theories for the quenching of star formation, a robust and complete description of environment is required, to be applied to a large sample of galaxies. EOS The environment of galaxies can be described using the density field of neighbours on multiple scales - the multiscale density field. EOS We are using the Millennium simulation and a simple HOD prescription which describes the multiscale density field of Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 galaxies to investigate the dependence of the fraction of red galaxies on the environment. EOS Using a volume limited sample where we have sufficient galaxies in narrow density bins, we have more dynamic range in halo mass and density for satellite galaxies than for central galaxies. EOS Therefore we model the red fraction of central galaxies as a constant while we use a functional form to describe the red fraction of satellites as a function of halo mass which allows us to distinguish a sharp from a gradual transition. EOS While it is clear that the data can only be explained by a gradual transition, an analysis of the multiscale density field on different scales suggests that colour segregation within the haloes is needed to explain the results.	We also rule out a sharp transition for central galaxies, within the halo mass range sampled.

EOS We have done numeric integration of orbits of pair with only planet perturbations and include Ceres and Vesta effect. EOS We have confirmed results of previous studying, obtained with different integrators.	And we confirm significant effect of Ceres and Vesta perturbation on dynamic of this pair.
doc	First quintuplet frequency solution of a Blazhko variable: light curve analysis of RV UMa EOS RV UMa is one of the RRab stars showing regular large amplitude light curve modulation. EOS Extended photoelectric observations of RV UMa obtained at the Konkoly Observatory were published by Kanyo (1976). EOS The analysis of the data was published by Kovacs (1995). EOS After detecting an error in the reduction procedure of the published Konkoly data, corrected photometric data are presented with additional, previously unpublished measurements.	The reanalysis of the combination of the corrected Konkoly data supplemented with Preston & Spinrad's (1967) observations has led to the discovery that the adequate mathematical model of the light curve is, in fact, a quintuplet, instead of a triplet frequency solution.
doc	Quantifying Structural Dynamic Heterogeneity in a Dense Two-dimensional Equilibrium Liquid EOS We investigate the local structural fluctuations of a model equilibrium fluid with an aim of better understanding the structural basis of locally heterogeneous dynamics identified in recent simulations and experimental studies of glass-forming liquids and other strongly interacting particle systems, such as, lipid membranes, dusty plasmas, interfacial dynamics of crystals, internal dynamics of proteins, etc. EOS In particular, we study a two-dimensional single component Lennard-Jones over a range of densities and constant temperature covering both the liquid and crystalline phase by molecular dynamics simulation. EOS We identify three distinct structural classes of particles by examining the immediate neighborhood of individual particles based on a solid-angle based tessellation technique.	In particular, the area distribution of the neighborhoods reveals cages having hexagonal, pentagonal and square symmetries.
doc	Mining Representative Unsubstituted Graph Patterns Using Prior Similarity Matrix EOS One of the most powerful techniques to study protein structures is to look for recurrent fragments (also called substructures or spatial motifs), then use them as patterns to characterize the proteins under study. EOS An emergent trend consists in parsing proteins three-dimensional (3D) structures into graphs of amino acids. EOS Hence, the search of recurrent spatial motifs is formulated as a process of frequent subgraph discovery where each subgraph represents a spatial motif.	In this scope, several efficient approaches for frequent subgraph discovery have been proposed in the literature.
doc	Study of the B^0 Semileptonic Decay Spectrum at the Upsilon(4S) Resonance EOS We have made a first measurement of the lepton momentum spectrum in a sample of events enriched in neutral B's through a partial reconstruction of B0 --> D*- l+ nu. EOS This spectrum, measured with 2.38 fb**-1 of data collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance by the CLEO II detector, is compared directly to the inclusive lepton spectrum from all Upsilon(4S) events in the same data set. EOS These two spectra are consistent with having the same shape above 1.5 GeV/c. EOS From the two spectra and two other CLEO measurements, we obtain the B0 and B+ semileptonic branching fractions, b0 and b+, their ratio, and the production ratio f+-/f00 of B+ and B0 pairs at the Upsilon(4S).	We report b+/b0=0.950 (+0.117-0.080) +- 0.091, b0 = (10.78 +- 0.60 +- 0.69)%, and b+ = (10.25 +- 0.57 +- 0.65)%.
doc	Boundary modeling in model-based calibration for automotive engines via the vertex representation of the convex hulls EOS When using the convex hull approach in the boundary modeling process, Model-Based Calibration (MBC) software suites -- such as Model-Based Calibration Toolbox from MathWorks -- can be computationally intensive depending on the amount of data modeled. EOS The reason for this is that the half-space representation of the convex hull is used. EOS We discuss here another representation of the convex hull, the vertex representation, which proves capable to reduce the computational cost.	Numerical comparisons in this article are executed in MATLAB by using MBC Toolbox commands, and show that for certain conditions, the vertex representation outperforms the half-space representation.

doc	Novel curved solitons of integrable (2 +1) dimensional KMN equation EOS In this letter, the unique exact lump and topological soliton solutions of integrable (2+1) dimensional Kundu Mukherjee Naskar (KMN) equation are obtained. EOS These solutions have an unusual property that they can get curved in the plane arbitrarily due to the presence of an arbitrary function of space(x) and time(t) in their analytic forms. EOS Due to this special feature, the solutions can be used to model the bending of optical solitonic beam, different types of wave structures in real physical experimental conditions.	This novel feature, which is a rare property for a constant coefficient completely integrable equation, arises due to the Galilean co-variance property and current like nonlinearity present in the KMN equation.
doc	TOFEC: Achieving Optimal Throughput-Delay Trade-off of Cloud Storage Using Erasure Codes EOS Our paper presents solutions using erasure coding, parallel connections to storage cloud and limited chunking (i.e., dividing the object into a few smaller segments) together to significantly improve the delay performance of uploading and downloading data in and out of cloud storage. EOS TOFEC is a strategy that helps front-end proxy adapt to level of workload by treating scalable cloud storage (e.g. EOS Amazon S3) as a shared resource requiring admission control. EOS Under light workloads, TOFEC creates more smaller chunks and uses more parallel connections per file, minimizing service delay. EOS Under heavy workloads, TOFEC automatically reduces the level of chunking (fewer chunks with increased size) and uses fewer parallel connections to reduce overhead, resulting in higher throughput and preventing queueing delay. EOS Our trace-driven simulation results show that TOFEC's adaptation mechanism converges to an appropriate code that provides the optimal delay-throughput trade-off without reducing system capacity.	Compared to a non-adaptive strategy optimized for throughput, TOFEC delivers 2.5x lower latency under light workloads;
doc	A single server queue with batch arrivals and semi-Markov services EOS We investigate the transient and stationary queue-length distributions of a class of service systems with correlated service times. EOS The classical _EQN_ queue with semi-Markov service times is the most prominent example in this class and serves as a vehicle to display our results. EOS The sequence of service times is governed by a modulating process _EQN_. EOS The state of _EQN_ at a service initiation time determines the joint distribution of the subsequent service duration and the state of _EQN_ at the next service initiation. EOS Several earlier works have imposed technical conditions, on the zeros of a matrix determinant arising in the analysis, that are required in the computation of the stationary queue length probabilities. EOS The imposed conditions in several of these articles are difficult or impossible to verify. EOS Without such assumptions, we determine both the transient and the steady-state joint distribution of the number of customers immediately after a departure and the state of the process _EQN_ at the start of the next service. EOS We numerically investigate how the mean queue length is affected by variability in the number of customers that arrive during a single service time.	Our main observations here are that increasing variability may reduce the mean queue length, and that the Markovian dependence of service times can lead to large queue lengths, even if the system is not in heavy traffic.

That is to say _EQN_ and _EQN_) where _EQN_ is the non trivial _EQN_ -automorphism of _EQN_.
doc	Far-IR and radio thermal continua in solar flares EOS With the invention of new far-infrared (FIR) and radio mm and sub-mm instruments (DESIR on SMESE satellite, ESO-ALMA), there is a growing interest in observations and analysis of solar flares in this so far unexplored wavelength region. EOS Two principal radiation mechanisms play a role: the synchrotron emission due to accelerated particle beams moving in the magnetic field and the thermal emission due to the energy deposit in the lower atmospheric layers. EOS In this contribution we explore the time-dependent effects of beams on thermal FIR and radio continua.	We show how and where these continua are formed in the presence of time dependent beam heating and non-thermal excitation/ionisation of the chromospheric hydrogen plasma.
doc	The complexity of parsec-scaled dusty tori in AGN EOS Warm gas and dust surround the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei (AGN). EOS They provide the material for accretion onto the super-massive black hole and they are held responsible for the orientation-dependent obscuration of the central engine. EOS The AGN-heated dust distributions turn out to be very compact with sizes on scales of about a parsec in the mid-infrared. EOS Only infrared interferometry currently provides the necessary angular resolution to directly study the physical properties of this dust. EOS Size estimates for the dust distributions derived from interferometric observations can be used to construct a size--luminosity relation for the dust distributions. EOS The large scatter about this relation suggests significant differences between the dust tori in the individual galaxies, even for nuclei of the same class of objects and with similar luminosities. EOS This questions the simple picture of the same dusty doughnut in all AGN. EOS The Circinus galaxy is the closest Seyfert 2 galaxy.	Because its mid-infrared emission is well resolved interferometrically, it is a prime target for detailed studies of its nuclear dust distribution.

These include: (i) a treatment based on the spin coherent state path-integral formulation of quantum ferrimagnets by taking into account the leading order quantum and thermal fluctuations (ii) a field-theoretical (non-linear _EQN_ -model type) formulation of the special case of one-dimensional quantum ferrimagnets at zero temperature (iii) an effective description in terms of dimers and quantum rotors, and (iv) a quantum renormalization group study of ferrimagnetic Heisenberg chains.
doc	A general purpose algorithm for counting simple cycles and simple paths of any length EOS We describe a general purpose algorithm for counting simple cycles and simple paths of any length _EQN_ on a (weighted di)graph on _EQN_ vertices and _EQN_ edges, achieving a time complexity of _EQN_. EOS In this expression, _EQN_ is the number of (weakly) connected induced subgraphs of _EQN_ on at most _EQN_ vertices, _EQN_ is the maximum degree of any vertex and _EQN_ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. EOS We compare the algorithm complexity both theoretically and experimentally with most of the existing algorithms for the same task. EOS These comparisons show that the algorithm described here is the best general purpose algorithm for the class of graphs where _EQN_, with _EQN_ the total number of simple cycles of length at most _EQN_, including backtracks and self-loops. EOS On Erd\H o s-R\'enyi random graphs, we find empirically that this happens when the edge probability is larger than circa _EQN_. EOS In addition, we show that some real-world networks also belong to this class. EOS Finally, the algorithm permits the enumeration of simple cycles and simple paths on networks where vertices are labeled from an alphabet on _EQN_ letters with a time complexity of _EQN_.	A Matlab implementation of the algorithm proposed here is available for download.

doc	Spontaneous emission from a two--level atom tunneling in a double--well potential EOS We study a two-level atom in a double--well potential coupled to a continuum of electromagnetic modes (black body radiation in three dimensions at zero absolute temperature). EOS Internal and external degrees of the atom couple due to recoil during emission of a photon. EOS We provide a full analysis of the problem in the long wavelengths limit up to the border of the Lamb-Dicke regime, including a study of the internal dynamics of the atom (spontaneous emission), the tunneling motion, and the electric field of the emitted photon. EOS The tunneling process itself may or may not decohere depending on the wavelength corresponding to the internal transition compared to the distance between the two wells of the external potential, as well as on the spontaneous emission rate compared to the tunneling frequency.	Interference fringes appear in the emitted light from a tunneling atom, or an atom in a stationary coherent superposition of its center--of--mass motion, if the wavelength is comparable to the well separation, but only if the external state of the atom is post-selected.
doc	Quantifying the effect of interannual ocean variability on the attribution of extreme climate events to human influence EOS In recent years, the climate change research community has become highly interested in describing the anthropogenic influence on extreme weather events, commonly termed "event attribution." Limitations in the observational record and in computational resources motivate the use of uncoupled, atmosphere/land-only climate models with prescribed ocean conditions run over a short period, leading up to and including an event of interest. EOS In this approach, large ensembles of high-resolution simulations can be generated under factual observed conditions and counterfactual conditions that might have been observed in the absence of human interference; EOS these can be used to estimate the change in probability of the given event due to anthropogenic influence. EOS However, using a prescribed ocean state ignores the possibility that estimates of attributable risk might be a function of the ocean state. EOS Thus, the uncertainty in attributable risk is likely underestimated, implying an over-confidence in anthropogenic influence. EOS In this work, we estimate the year-to-year variability in calculations of the anthropogenic contribution to extreme weather based on large ensembles of atmospheric model simulations. EOS Our results both quantify the magnitude of year-to-year variability and categorize the degree to which conclusions of attributable risk are qualitatively affected. EOS The methodology is illustrated by exploring extreme temperature and precipitation events for the northwest coast of South America and northern-central Siberia;	we also provides results for regions around the globe.
doc	Heuristic algorithms for the Longest Filled Common Subsequence Problem EOS At CPM 2017, Castelli et al define and study a new variant of the Longest Common Subsequence Problem, termed the Longest Filled Common Subsequence Problem (LFCS). EOS For the LFCS problem, the input consists of two strings _EQN_ and _EQN_ and a multiset of characters _EQN_. EOS The goal is to insert the characters from _EQN_ into the string _EQN_, thus obtaining a new string _EQN_, such that the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between _EQN_ and _EQN_ is maximized. EOS Casteli et al show that the problem is NP-hard and provide a 3/5-approximation algorithm for the problem.	In this paper we study the problem from the experimental point of view.

During this stage, Transmission Electron Microscopy showed fine precipitates of average size 4 nm, dispersed throughout the sample and from EDS analysis they are found to be Cr-enriched.
doc	Atomic-scale structure analysis of a molecule at a (6-nanometer) _EQN_ ice crystal EOS Water is the most important solvent in nature. EOS It is a crucial issue to study interactions among water molecules. EOS Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools to detect magnetic interactions for the structure analysis of a molecule with broad applications. EOS But conventional NMR spectroscopy requires macroscopic sample quantities with hampers in investigating nanoscale structures. EOS Through quantum control of a single spin quantum sensor, magnetic resonance spectroscopy of nanoscale organic molecules and single molecules has been achieved. EOS However, the measurement of the dipolar interaction of nuclear spins within a molecule at nanoscale and the analysis of its structure remain a big challenge. EOS Here we succeed in detecting the NMR spectrum from an ice crystal with (6-nanometer) _EQN_ detection volume. EOS More importantly, the magnetic dipolar coupling between two proton nuclear spins of a water molecule was recorded. EOS The resolved intra-molecule magnetic dipolar interactions are about 15 kHz and 33 kHz with spectral resolution at a few kHz.	Analysis of the interaction-resolved NMR spectroscopy provides a spatial view of nanoscale ice crystal, from which the orientation of a water-molecule bond is derived and further the length of the bond can be got.
doc	How reliable and useful is Cabell's Blacklist? A data-driven analysis EOS In scholarly publishing, blacklists aim to register fraudulent or deceptive journals and publishers, also known as "predatory", to minimise the spread of unreliable research and the growing of fake publishing outlets. EOS However, blacklisting remains a very controversial activity for several reasons: there is no consensus regarding the criteria used to determine fraudulent journals, the criteria used may not always be transparent or relevant, and blacklists are rarely updated regularly. EOS Cabell's paywalled blacklist service attempts to overcome some of these issues in reviewing fraudulent journals on the basis of transparent criteria and in providing allegedly up-to-date information at the journal entry level. EOS We tested Cabell's blacklist to analyse whether or not it could be adopted as a reliable tool by stakeholders in scholarly communication, including our own academic library. EOS To do so, we used a copy of Walt Crawford's Gray Open Access dataset (2012-2016) to assess the coverage of Cabell's blacklist and get insights on their methodology.	Out of the 10,123 journals that we tested, 4,681 are included in Cabell's blacklist.
doc	Microscopic theory for electron hydrodynamics in monolayer and bilayer graphene EOS Electrons behave like a classical fluid with a momentum distribution function that varies slowly in space and time when the quantum mechanical carrier-carrier scattering dominates over all other scattering processes. EOS Recent experiments in monolayer and bilayer graphene have reported signatures of such hydrodynamic electron behavior in ultra-clean devices. EOS In this theoretical work, starting from a microscopic treatment of electron-electron, electron-phonon and electron-impurity interactions within the Random Phase Approximation, we demonstrate that monolayer and bilayer graphene both host two different hydrodynamic regimes. EOS We predict that the hydrodynamic window in bilayer graphene is stronger than in monolayer graphene, and has a characteristic `v-shape' as opposed to a `lung-shape'.	Finally, we collapse experimental data onto a universal disorder-limited theory, thereby proving that the observed violation of Wiedemann-Franz law in monolayers occurs in a regime dominated by impurity-induced electron-hole puddles.

doc	Charm meson production from meson-nucleon scattering EOS Using an effective hadronic Lagrangian with physical hadron masses and coupling constants determined either empirically or from SU(4) flavor symmetry, we study the production cross sections of charm mesons from pion and rho meson interactions with nucleons. EOS With a cutoff parameter of 1 GeV at interaction vertices as usually used in studying the cross sections for _EQN_ absorption and charm meson scattering by hadrons, we find that the cross sections for charm meson production have values of a few tenth of mb and are dominated by the s channel nucleon pole diagram.	Relevance of these reactions to charm meson production in relativistic heavy ion collisions is discussed.
doc	Nonlinear Evolution of Very Small Scale Cosmological Baryon Perturbations at Recombination EOS The evolution of baryon density perturbations on very small scales is investigated. EOS In particular, the nonlinear growth induced by the radiation drag force from the shear velocity field on larger scales during the recombination epoch, which is originally proposed by Shaviv in 1998, is studied in detail. EOS It is found that inclusion of the diffusion term which Shaviv neglected in his analysis results in rather mild growth whose growth rate is _EQN_ instead of enormous amplification _EQN_ of Shaviv's original claim since the diffusion suppresses the growth. EOS The growth factor strongly depends on the amplitude of the large scale velocity field. EOS The nonlinear growth mechanism is applied to density perturbations of general adiabatic cold dark matter (CDM) models. EOS In these models, it has been found in the previous works that the baryon density perturbations are not completely erased by diffusion damping if there exists gravitational potential of CDM. EOS With employing the perturbed rate equation which is derived in this paper, the nonlinear evolution of baryon density perturbations is investigated.	It is found that: (1) The nonlinear growth is larger for smaller scales.

doc	CVC: The Contourlet Video Compression algorithm for real-time applications EOS Nowadays, real-time video communication over the internet through video conferencing applications has become an invaluable tool in everyone's professional and personal life. EOS This trend underlines the need for video coding algorithms that provide acceptable quality on low bitrates and can support various resolutions inside the same stream in order to cope with limitations on computational resources and network bandwidth. EOS In this work, a novel scalable video coding algorithm based on the contourlet transform is presented. EOS The algorithm utilizes both lossy and lossless methods in order to achieve compression.	One of its most notable features is that due to the transform utilised, it does not suffer from blocking artifacts that occur with many widely adopted compression algorithms.

We measured the rotational velocity (v sin i = 26.5+/-2.0 km/s), which, coupled with the constraints on the white dwarf mass from the X-ray spectroscopy, leads to the conclusion that the donor star barely fills 70% of its corresponding Roche lobe radius.

doc	Growth of beam-plasma instabilities in the presence of background inhomogeneity EOS We explore how inhomogeneity in the background plasma number density alters the growth of electrostatic unstable wavemodes of beam plasma systems. EOS This is particularly interesting for blazar-driven beam-plasma instabilities, which may be suppressed by inhomogeneities in the intergalactic medium as was recently claimed in the literature.	Using high resolution Particle-In-Cell simulations with the SHARP code, we show that the growth of the instability is local, i.e., regions with almost homogeneous background density will support the growth of the Langmuir waves, even when they are separated by strongly inhomogeneous regions, resulting in an overall slower growth of the instability.
doc	Anisotropic Magnification Distortion of the 3D Galaxy Correlation: II. Fourier and Redshift Space EOS In paper I of this series we discuss how magnification bias distorts the 3D correlation function by enhancing the observed correlation in the line-of-sight (LOS) orientation, especially on large scales. EOS This lensing anisotropy is distinctive, making it possible to separately measure the galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-magnification and magnification-magnification correlations. EOS Here we extend the discussion to the power spectrum and also to redshift space. EOS In real space, pairs oriented close to the LOS direction are not protected against nonlinearity even if the pair separation is large;	this is because nonlinear fluctuations can enter through gravitational lensing at a small transverse separation (or i.e.

doc	Interstellar Medium Oxygen Abundances of Dwarf Irregular Galaxies in Centaurus A and Nearby Groups EOS We present results of optical spectroscopy of 35 H II regions from eight dwarf galaxies in the Centaurus A group. EOS [O III]4363 A is detected in ESO272-G025 and ESO324-G024, and direct oxygen abundances of 12+log(O/H) = 7.76 +/- 0.09 and 7.94 +/- 0.11 are derived, respectively. EOS For the remaining galaxies, abundances are derived using common bright-line methods. EOS To compare the influence of group environments on dwarf galaxies, we have also gathered data for additional dwarf irregular galaxies from the Cen A and the Sculptor groups from the literature. EOS We have examined possible relationships between oxygen abundance, gas fraction, effective chemical yield, and tidal indices. EOS Despite large positive tidal indices for a number of Cen A dwarfs in the present sample, there is no clear separation between galaxies with positive tidal indices and galaxies with negative tidal indices in the luminosity-metallicity, metallicity-gas fraction, and metallicity-tidal index diagrams. EOS The H I surface mass density decreases with increasing positive tidal index, which is expected in strong tidal encounters. EOS There are no strong trends between oxygen abundances or yields and projected distances of galaxies within their respective groups.	We also present spectra for 13 H II regions in three nearby dwarf irregular galaxies: DDO 47, NGC 3109, and Sextans B.

doc	Tracking down R Coronae Borealis stars from their mid-infrared WISE colours EOS R Coronae Borealis stars (RCBs) are hydrogen-deficient and carbon-rich supergiant stars. EOS They are very rare, as only _EQN_ are actually known in our Galaxy. EOS Interestingly, RCBs are strongly suspected to be the evolved merger product of two white dwarfs and could therefore be an important tool to understand Supernovae type Ia in the double degenerate scenario. EOS Constraints on the spatial distribution and the formation rate of such stars are needed to picture their origin and test it in the context of actual population synthesis results. EOS To do so, it is crucial to increase significantly the number of known RCBs. EOS With an absolute magnitude _EQN_ and a bright/hot circumstellar shell made of amorphous carbon grains, RCBs are really distinctive stars.	Mono-epoch mid-infrared data can help us to discriminate RCBs among other dust-producing stars.
doc	The Interacting Dwarf Galaxy NGC 3077: The Interplay of Atomic and Molecular Gas with Violent Star Formation EOS We present a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of the nearby interacting dwarf galaxy NGC3077 (member of the M81 triplet). EOS High resolution VLA HI observations show that most of the atomic gas (~90%) around NGC3077 is situated in a prominent tidal arm with a complex velocity structure. EOS Little HI (~5 x 10^7 M_sun) is associated with NGC3077 itself. EOS High resolution OVRO observations of the molecular component (CO) reveal the presence of 16 molecular complexes near the center of NGC3077 (total mass: ~1.6 x 10^6 M_sun). EOS A virial mass analysis of the individual complexes yields a lower CO-to-H_2 conversion factor in NGC3077 than the Galactic value - a surprising result for a dwarf galaxy. EOS The total (atomic and molecular) gas content in the centre of NGC3077 is displaced from the stellar component of NGC3077 -- this implies that not only the gas at large galactocentric radii is affected by the interaction within the triplet but also the center. EOS We speculate that the starburst activity of NGC3077 was triggered by this redistribution of gas in the center. EOS Some of these supershells are surrounded by neutral hydrogen. EOS In a few cases, the rims of the ionized supershells are associated with dust absorption. EOS The most prominent star forming region in NGC3077 as probed by Pa-alpha observations is hidden behind a dust cloud which is traced by the molecular complexes. EOS Correcting for extinction we derive a star forming rate of 0.05 M_sun year^-1, i.e.	given the reservoir in atomic and molecular gas in NGC3077, star formation may proceed at a similar rate for a few 10^8 years.

doc	Kupka-Smale diffeomorphisms at the boundary of uniform hyperbolicity: a model EOS We construct an explicit example of family of non-uniformly hyperbolic diffeomorphisms, at the boundary of the set of uniformly hyperbolic systems, with one orbit of cubic heteroclinic tangency. EOS One of the leaves involved in this heteroclinic tangency is periodic, and there is a certain degree of freedom for the choice of the second one.	For a non-countable set of choices, this leaf is not periodic and the diffeomorphism is Kupka-Smale: every periodic point is hyperbolic and the intersections of stable and unstable leaves of periodic points are transverse.

doc	Fiber and Crystals Dual Readout calorimeters EOS The RD52 (DREAM) collaboration is performing R\&D on dual readout calorimetry techniques with the aim of improving hadronic energy resolution for future high energy physics experiments. EOS The simultaneous detection of Cherenkov and scintillation light enables us to measure the electromagnetic fraction of hadron shower event-by-event. EOS As a result, we could eliminate the main fluctuation which prevented from achieving precision energy measurement for hadrons. EOS We have tested the performance of the lead and copper fiber prototypes calorimeters with various energies of electromagnetic particles and hadrons. EOS During the beam test, we investigated the energy resolutions for electrons and pions as well as the identification of those particles in a longitudinally unsegmented calorimeter. EOS Measurements were also performed on pure and doped PbWO _EQN_ crystals, as well as BGO and BSO, with the aim of realising a crystal based dual readout detector.	We will describe our results, focusing on the more promising properties of homogeneous media for the technique.

EOS It is shown that the slope of the average N/Z ratio of emitted nucleons vs impact parameters for these reactions is very sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy.	Our study also shows that the yields of _EQN_ and _EQN_ decrease with impact parameters and slope of the yield of _EQN_ vs impact parameters as well as the ratio of Y(_EQN_)/Y(_EQN_) depend on the symmetry potential strongly for peripheral heavy-ion collisions.
doc	Rare Z Decays and Neutrino Flavor Universality EOS We study rare four-body decays of the Z-boson involving at least one neutrino and one charged lepton. EOS Large destructive interferences make these decays very sensitive to the Z couplings to neutrinos.

The rare four-body processes could be accurately measured at future lepton colliders, leading to percent level precision.

EOS At leading order in the coupling constant the hard scales of the plasma can be viewed as on-shell classical particles.	Based on this observation, and without any reference to the state of the system, we derive an effective field theory describing the quantum fluctuations around an on-shell fermion with energy _EQN_, described as a set of high dimension operators over the on-shell energy _EQN_.
doc	Photonic realization of erasure-based nonlocal measurements EOS Relativity theory severely restricts the ability to perform nonlocal measurements in quantum mechanics. EOS Studying such nonlocal schemes may thus reveal insights regarding the relations between these two fundamental theories. EOS Therefore, for the last several decades, nonlocal measurements have stimulated considerable interest. EOS However, the experimental implementation of nonlocal measurements imposes profound restrictions due to the fact that the interaction Hamiltonian cannot contain, in general, nonlocal observables such as the product of local observables belonging to different particles at spacelike-separated regions. EOS In this work, we experimentally realize a scheme for nonlocal measurements with the aid of probabilistic quantum erasure.	We apply this scheme to the tasks of performing high accuracy nonlocal measurements of the parity, as well as measurements in the Bell basis, which do not necessitate classical communication between the parties.

doc	Coarse-graining and designing liquids by combining machine learning with liquid state theory EOS A key challenge for soft materials design and coarse-graining simulations is determining interaction potentials between components that give rise to desired condensed-phase structures. EOS In theory, the Ornstein-Zernike equation provides an elegant framework for solving this inverse problem. EOS Pioneering work in liquid state theory derived analytical closures for the framework. EOS However, these analytical closures are approximations, valid only for specific classes of interaction potentials. EOS In this work, we combine the physics of liquid state theory with deep learning to infer a closure directly from simulation data. EOS The resulting closure is more accurate than commonly used closures across a broad range of interaction potentials.	We show for a prototypical inverse design problem, fitting a coarse-grained simulation potential, that our approach leads to significantly improved one-step inversion.

doc	Fractional Programming for Robust TX BF Design in Multi-User/Single-Carrier PD-NOMA EOS We present a new Beamforming-based (BB) Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO)-Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) scheme for Power Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA), in which the total transmit power consumption is minimized subjected to prescribed signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for each user, and under the assumption that only imperfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter. EOS To this end, the fractional programming (FP)-based quadratic transform is employed to reformulate the non-convex SINR constraint of the original problem into a tractable quadratic form, which contains an estimate of the CSI error vector as a parameter.	Taking advantage of the fact that the zero duality gap holds for the non-convex quadratic problems, a closed-form expression for an estimate of the CSI error vector is derived, completing the formulation.

doc	Models of the circumstellar medium of evolving, massive runaway stars moving through the Galactic plane EOS At least 5 per cent of the massive stars are moving supersonically through the interstellar medium (ISM) and are expected to produce a stellar wind bow shock. EOS We explore how the mass loss and space velocity of massive runaway stars affect the morphology of their bow shocks. EOS We run two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations following the evolution of the circumstellar medium of these stars in the Galactic plane from the main sequence to the red supergiant phase. EOS We find that thermal conduction is an important process governing the shape, size and structure of the bow shocks around hot stars, and that they have an optical luminosity mainly produced by forbidden lines, e.g. EOS [OIII]. EOS The Ha emission of the bow shocks around hot stars originates from near their contact discontinuity. EOS The H _EQN_ emission of bow shocks around cool stars originates from their forward shock, and is too faint to be observed for the bow shocks that we simulate. EOS The emission of optically-thin radiation mainly comes from the shocked ISM material. EOS All bow shock models are brighter in the infrared, i.e. EOS the infrared is the most appropriate waveband to search for bow shocks. EOS Our study suggests that the infrared emission comes from near the contact discontinuity for bow shocks of hot stars and from the inner region of shocked wind for bow shocks around cool stars. EOS We predict that, in the Galactic plane, the brightest, i.e.	the most easily detectable bow shocks are produced by high-mass stars moving with small space velocities.

doc	Correlations Between Black Holes and Host Galaxies in the Illustris and IllustrisTNG Simulations EOS We study black hole - host galaxy correlations, and the relation between the over-massiveness (the distance from the average _EQN_ relation) of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and star formation histories of their host galaxies in the Illustris and TNG100 simulations. EOS We find that both simulations are able to produce black hole scaling relations in general agreement with observations at _EQN_, but with noticeable discrepancies. EOS Both simulations show an offset from the observations for the _EQN_ relation, and the relation between _EQN_ and the Sersic index. EOS The relation between _EQN_ and stellar mass _EQN_ is tighter than the observations, especially for TNG100. EOS For massive galaxies in both simulations, the hosts of over-massive SMBHs (those above the mean _EQN_ relation) tend to have larger Sersic indices and lower baryon conversion efficiency, suggesting a multidimensional link between SMBHs and properties of their hosts. EOS In Illustris, the hosts of over-massive SMBHs have formed earlier and have lower present-day star formation rates, in qualitative agreement with the observations for massive galaxies with _EQN_. EOS For low-mass galaxies, such a correlation still holds in Illustris but does not exist in the observed data. EOS For TNG100, the correlation between SMBH over-massiveness and star formation history is much weaker. EOS The hosts of over-massive SMBHs generally have consistently larger star formation rates throughout history. EOS These galaxies have higher stellar mass as well, due to the strong _EQN_ correlation.	Our findings show that simulated SMBH scaling relations and correlations are sensitive to features in the modeling of SMBHs.
doc	A Microscopic View of Parton _EQN_ Effects In High _EQN_ Processes EOS A microscopic mechanism is proposed for understanding the rather large _EQN_ effects (_EQN_ = _EQN_, as yet unaccounted for by hard QCD), found by the Fermilab E706 Collaboration for 530 and 800 GeV/c protons incident on light nuclear targets (mass _EQN_) like Be. EOS The essential idea is that such high incident projectile momenta tend to break up the confinement barriers for the quark-partons residing in the individual nucleonic constituents of the target nucleus that fall in a tube-like zone around the projectile's path, so that these particles tend to behave as a collection of quark-partons confronting the beam. EOS Using simple combinatorial principles, the resultant _EQN_ value works out as _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the number of affected nucleons in the tube-like zone, and _EQN_ is a scale parameter derived from the basic quark-pair interaction. EOS Using the previously found results of a Bethe-Salpeter model (attuned to _EQN_ and _EQN_ spectroscopy), one in which a key ingredient is the infrared part of the gluon propagator, giving _EQN_, the desired _EQN_ range is reproduced, suggesting the persistence of _EQN_ QCD effects even at high _EQN_.

doc	Modeling, Analysis, and Mitigation of Dynamic Botnet Formation in Wireless IoT Networks EOS The Internet of Things (IoT) relies heavily on wireless communication devices that are able to discover and interact with other wireless devices in their vicinity. EOS The communication flexibility coupled with software vulnerabilities in devices, due to low cost and short time-to-market, exposes them to a high risk of malware infiltration. EOS Malware may infect a large number of network devices using device-to-device (D2D) communication resulting in the formation of a botnet, i.e., a network of infected devices controlled by a common malware. EOS A botmaster may exploit it to launch a network-wide attack sabotaging infrastructure and facilities, or for malicious purposes such as collecting ransom. EOS In this paper, we propose an analytical model to study the D2D propagation of malware in wireless IoT networks. EOS Leveraging tools from dynamic population processes and point process theory, we capture malware infiltration and coordination process over a network topology. EOS The analysis of mean-field equilibrium in the population is used to construct and solve an optimization problem for the network defender to prevent botnet formation by patching devices while causing minimum overhead to network operation.	The developed analytical model serves as a basis for assisting the planning, design, and defense of such networks from a defender's standpoint.

EOS Origi- nally demonstrated in the spatial domain using classical or entangled-photon sources, it was recently shown that ghost imaging can be transposed into the time domain to detect ultrafast signals with high temporal resolution. EOS Here, using an incoherent supercontinuum light source whose spectral fluctuations are imaged using spectrum- to-time transformation in a dispersive fiber, we experimentally demonstrate magnified ghost imaging in the time domain.	Our approach is scalable and allows to overcome the resolution limitation of time-domain ghost imaging.

EOS Haro11 displays complex emission line profiles, consisting of narrow (FWHM<200 km/s) and broad (FWHM 200-300 km/s) components. EOS We identify three distinct emission knots kinematically connected to one another.	A chemodynamical analysis is presented, revealing that spatially resolved ionic and elemental abundances do not agree with those derived from integrated spectra across the galaxy.

EOS The promising learned indexes leverage deep-learning models to complement existing index structures and obtain significant memory savings.	However, the learned indexes fail to become scalable due to the heavy inter-model dependency and expensive retraining.

doc	The XXL Survey III. Luminosity-temperature relation of the Bright Cluster Sample EOS The XXL Survey is the largest homogeneous survey carried out with XMM-Newton. EOS Covering an area of 50 deg _EQN_, the survey contains several hundred galaxy clusters out to a redshift of _EQN_ 2 above an X-ray flux limit of _EQN_ 5 _EQN_ erg cm _EQN_ s _EQN_. EOS This paper belongs to the first series of XXL papers focusing on the bright cluster sample. EOS We investigate the luminosity-temperature (LT) relation for the brightest clusters detected in the XXL Survey, taking fully into account the selection biases. EOS We investigate the form of the LT relation, placing constraints on its evolution. EOS We have classified the 100 brightest clusters in the XXL Survey based on their measured X-ray flux. EOS These 100 clusters have been analysed to determine their luminosity and temperature to evaluate the LT relation. EOS We used three methods to fit the LT relation, with two of these methods providing a prescription to fully take into account the selection effects of the survey. EOS We measure the evolution of the LT relation internally using the broad redshift range of the sample. EOS Taking into account selection effects, we find a slope of the bolometric LT relation of B _EQN_ 0.15, steeper than the self-similar expectation (B _EQN_ =2).	Our best-fit result for the evolution factor is _EQN_, consistent with "strong self-similar" evolution where clusters scale self-similarly with both mass and redshift.
doc	Investigation of a confined C-class flare in an arch filament system close to a regular sunspot EOS A moderate C1.1 class confined flare is investigated here, which occurred on 2013 September 24 at 22:56~UT, in an arch filament system close to a regular, unipolar sunspot. EOS Spectro-polarimetric observations from the Tenerife Infrared Polarimeter at the 70 cm German Vacuum Tower Telescope were combined with data from the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly to identify the processes that triggered the flare. EOS The legs of this arch filament were anchored in the leading sunspot and the network flux region of opposite polarity. EOS The flare was driven by small-scale, flux cancellation at the weak neutral line underlying the arch filament which resulted in two small flaring events within an hour of the C1.1 flare. EOS Flux cancellation was facilitated by the moat flow from the leading sunspot wherein small-scale magnetic fragments stream towards patches of pre-existing flux. EOS The cancellation of flux led to the destabilization of the arch filament which was seen as an increase in the twist along the arch filament.	The horizontal fields across the weak neutral line decay faster which cannot prevent the filament from rising that results in a two-ribbon flare at the neutral line.

EOS These models are shown to be extremely efficient when training and test data are drawn from the same distribution. EOS However, it is not clear how a network will act when it is fed with an out-of-distribution example. EOS In this work, we consider the problem of out-of-distribution detection in neural networks. EOS We propose to use multiple semantic dense representations instead of sparse representation as the target label.	Specifically, we propose to use several word representations obtained from different corpora or architectures as target labels.

Such truncation is justified, at sufficiently low energy, in the framework of a systematic chiral expansion.
doc	Exact solution for mean first-passage time on a pseudofractal scale-free web EOS The explicit determinations of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for trapping problem are limited to some simple structure, e.g., regular lattices and regular geometrical fractals, and determining MFPT for random walks on other media, especially complex real networks, is a theoretical challenge. EOS In this paper, we investigate a simple random walk on the the pseudofractal scale-free web (PSFW) with a perfect trap located at a node with the highest degree, which simultaneously exhibits the remarkable scale-free and small-world properties observed in real networks. EOS We obtain the exact solution for the MFPT that is calculated through the recurrence relations derived from the structure of PSFW.	The rigorous solution exhibits that the MFPT approximately increases as a power-law function of the number of nodes, with the exponent less than 1.

doc	Memory-Efficient Adaptive Optimization EOS Adaptive gradient-based optimizers such as Adagrad and Adam are crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in machine translation and language modeling. EOS However, these methods maintain second-order statistics for each parameter, thus introducing significant memory overheads that restrict the size of the model being used as well as the number of examples in a mini-batch. EOS We describe an effective and flexible adaptive optimization method with greatly reduced memory overhead.	Our method retains the benefits of per-parameter adaptivity while allowing significantly larger models and batch sizes.

EOS We use data from galaxy and Lyman- _EQN_ power spectra to constrain the linear growth rate.	We find _EQN_ for the growth rate index and _EQN_ for the additional growth parameter we introduce.

doc	Multiplicity of Galactic Cepheids from long-baseline interferometry I. CHARA/MIRC detection of the companion of V1334 Cygni EOS We aim at determining the masses of Cepheids in binary systems, as well as their geometric distances and the flux contribution of the companions. EOS The combination of interferometry with spectroscopy will offer a unique and independent estimate of the Cepheid masses. EOS Using long-baseline interferometry at visible and infrared wavelengths, it is possible to spatially resolve binary systems containing a Cepheid down to milliarcsecond separations. EOS Based on the resulting visual orbit and radial velocities, we can then derive the fundamental parameters of these systems, particularly the masses of the components and the geometric distance. EOS We therefore performed interferometric observations of the first-overtone mode Cepheid V1334 Cyg with the CHARA/MIRC combiner.	We report the first detection of a Cepheid companion using long-baseline interferometry.

EOS We show that _EQN_ is the same between the single field models and multifield models while _EQN_ is bounded above by the results of single field models. EOS Below its maximum value, _EQN_ depends on the specific distributions of parameters in the model.	The general trend is that the wider the distributions are, the smaller _EQN_ is.
doc	Gaussian Quadrature Inference for Multicarrier Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution EOS We propose the Gaussian quadrature inference (GQI) method for multicarrier continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). EOS A multicarrier CVQKD protocol utilizes Gaussian subcarrier quantum continuous variables (CV) for information transmission. EOS The GQI framework provides a minimal error estimate of the quadratures of the CV quantum states from the discrete, measured noisy subcarrier variables. EOS GQI utilizes the fundamentals of regularization theory and statistical information processing.	We characterize GQI for multicarrier CVQKD, and define a method for the statistical modeling and processing of noisy Gaussian subcarrier quadratures.
doc	Non-Adversarial Imitation Learning and its Connections to Adversarial Methods EOS Many modern methods for imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning, such as GAIL or AIRL, are based on an adversarial formulation. EOS These methods apply GANs to match the expert's distribution over states and actions with the implicit state-action distribution induced by the agent's policy. EOS However, by framing imitation learning as a saddle point problem, adversarial methods can suffer from unstable optimization, and convergence can only be shown for small policy updates. EOS We address these problems by proposing a framework for non-adversarial imitation learning. EOS The resulting algorithms are similar to their adversarial counterparts and, thus, provide insights for adversarial imitation learning methods. EOS Most notably, we show that AIRL is an instance of our non-adversarial formulation, which enables us to greatly simplify its derivations and obtain stronger convergence guarantees. EOS We also show that our non-adversarial formulation can be used to derive novel algorithms by presenting a method for offline imitation learning that is inspired by the recent ValueDice algorithm, but does not rely on small policy updates for convergence.	In our simulated robot experiments, our offline method for non-adversarial imitation learning seems to perform best when using many updates for policy and discriminator at each iteration and outperforms behavioral cloning and ValueDice.

Our main concern was to know how electrical stimulation induces neural activity and leads to a behavioral response.
doc	Shuffle algebra realizations of type _EQN_ super Yangians and quantum affine superalgebras for all Cartan data EOS We introduce super Yangians of _EQN_ (in the new Drinfeld realization) associated to all Dynkin diagrams of _EQN_, where _EQN_ is a finite-dimensional super vector space. EOS We show that all of them are isomorphic to the super Yangians introduced by Maxim Nazarov, by identifying them with the corresponding RTT super Yangians. EOS However, their "positive halves" are not pairwise isomorphic, and we obtain the shuffle algebra realizations of those.	We adapt the latter to the trigonometric setup by obtaining the shuffle algebra realizations of the "positive halves" of type _EQN_ quantum loop superalgebras associated to arbitrary Dynkin diagrams.

Behavior of electric potential near the center of the square is obtained.

EOS Our focus is on inelastic cotunneling in systems with weakly broken degeneracies, such as complex quantum dots or molecules.	We find for these systems a characteristic gate dependence of the non-equilibrium cotunneling conductance.
doc	ADE Double Scaled Little String Theories, Mock Modular Forms and Umbral Moonshine EOS We consider double scaled little string theory on _EQN_. EOS These theories are labelled by a positive integer _EQN_ and an _EQN_ root lattice with Coxeter number _EQN_. EOS We count BPS fundamental string states in the holographic dual of this theory using the superconformal field theory _EQN_. EOS We show that the BPS fundamental string states that are counted by the second helicity supertrace of this theory give rise to weight two mixed mock modular forms. EOS We compute the helicity supertraces using two separate techniques: a path integral analysis that leads to a modular invariant but non-holomorphic answer, and a Hamiltonian analysis of the contribution from discrete states which leads to a holomorphic but not modular invariant answer. EOS From a mathematical point of view the Hamiltonian analysis leads to a mixed mock modular form while the path integral gives the completion of this mixed mock modular form. EOS We also compare these weight two mixed mock modular forms to those that appear in instances of Umbral Moonshine labelled by Niemeier root lattices _EQN_ that are powers of _EQN_ root lattices and find that they are equal up to a constant factor that we determine.	In the course of the analysis we encounter an interesting generalization of Appell-Lerch sums and generalizations of the Riemann relations of Jacobi theta functions that they obey.

doc	On stability of difference schemes. Central schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws with source terms EOS The stability of difference schemes for, in general, hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source terms are studied. EOS The basic approach is to investigate the stability of a non-linear scheme in terms of its cor- responding scheme in variations. EOS Such an approach leads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems to establish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. EOS It is established the notion that a non-linear scheme is stable if and only if the corresponding scheme in variations is stable. EOS A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF) scheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. EOS A monotone piecewise cubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate approximation for the model in question.	The stability of the modified scheme are investigated.

doc	Jointly Optimizing Preprocessing and Inference for DNN-based Visual Analytics EOS While deep neural networks (DNNs) are an increasingly popular way to query large corpora of data, their significant runtime remains an active area of research. EOS As a result, researchers have proposed systems and optimizations to reduce these costs by allowing users to trade off accuracy and speed. EOS In this work, we examine end-to-end DNN execution in visual analytics systems on modern accelerators. EOS Through a novel measurement study, we show that the preprocessing of data (e.g., decoding, resizing) can be the bottleneck in many visual analytics systems on modern hardware. EOS To address the bottleneck of preprocessing, we introduce two optimizations for end-to-end visual analytics systems. EOS First, we introduce novel methods of achieving accuracy and throughput trade-offs by using natively present, low-resolution visual data. EOS Second, we develop a runtime engine for efficient visual DNN inference. EOS This runtime engine a) efficiently pipelines preprocessing and DNN execution for inference, b) places preprocessing operations on the CPU or GPU in a hardware- and input-aware manner, and c) efficiently manages memory and threading for high throughput execution. EOS We implement these optimizations in a novel system, Smol, and evaluate Smol on eight visual datasets.	We show that its optimizations can achieve up to 5.9x end-to-end throughput improvements at a fixed accuracy over recent work in visual analytics.
doc	Demystification of quantum entanglement EOS One of the crucial differences between mathematical models of classical and quantum mechanics is the use of the tensor product of the state spaces of subsystems as the state space of the corresponding composite system. EOS (To describe an ensemble of classical composite systems one uses random variables taking values in the Cartesian product of the state spaces of subsystems.) We show that, nevertheless, it is possible to establish a natural correspondence between the classical and quantum probabilistic descriptions of composite systems. EOS Quantum averages for composite systems (including entangled) can be represented as averages with respect to classical random fields. EOS It is essentially what Albert Einstein was dreamed of. EOS Quantum mechanics is represented as classical statistical mechanics with infinite-dimensional phase space.	While the mathematical construction is completely rigorous, its physical interpretation is a complicated problem (which will not be discussed in this paper).

EOS Subsequently, anchor regression has been proposed to trade-off invariance and predictability. EOS The resulting estimator is shown to have optimal predictive performance under bounded shift interventions.	In this paper, we show that the concepts of anchor regression and K-class estimators are closely related.
doc	Tidal Tails Around 20 Galactic Globular Cluster: Observational Evidence for Gravitational Disk/Bulge Shocking EOS Large-field multi-color images of 20 galactic globular clusters are used to investigate the presence of tidal tails around these stellar systems. EOS Field and cluster stars are sorted with the help of color-magnitude diagrams, and star-count analysis is performed on the selected cluster stars in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of their surface density. EOS We study the overdensities of these stars using the wavelet transform of the star counts in order to filter the background density noise and to detect the weak structures, at large scale, formed by the numerous stars previously members of the clusters. EOS We associate these stellar overdensities with the stars evaporated from the clusters because of dynamical relaxation and/or tidal stripping from the clusters by the galactic gravitational field.	Most of the globular clusters in our sample display strong evidence of tidal interactions with the galactic plane in the form of large and extended deformations.
doc	Are Scalar and Tensor Deviations Related in Modified Gravity? EOS Modified gravity theories on cosmic scales have three key deviations from general relativity. EOS They can cause cosmic acceleration without a physical, highly negative pressure fluid, can cause a gravitational slip between the two metric potentials, and can cause gravitational waves to propagate differently, e.g. EOS with a speed different from the speed of light. EOS We examine whether the deviations in the metric potentials as observable through modified Poisson equations for scalar density perturbations are related to or independent from deviations in the tensor gravitational waves. EOS We show analytically they are independent instantaneously in covariant Galileon gravity -- e.g.	at some time one of them can have the general relativity value while the other deviates -- though related globally -- if one deviates over a finite period, the other at some point shows a deviation.
doc	One Dimensional Regularizations of the Coulomb Potential with Application to Atoms in Strong Magnetic Fields EOS We consider one-dimensional regularizations of the Coulomb potential formed by taking a two-dimensional expectation of the Coulomb potential with respect to the Landau states. EOS It is well-known that such functions arises naturally in the study of atoms in strong magnetic fields.	For many-electron atoms consideration of the Pauli principle requires convex combinations of such potentials and interactions in which the regularizations also contain a 2^ -1/2 rescaling.
doc	An Incomplete Cryptography based Digital Rights Management with DCFF EOS In general, DRM (Digital Rights Management) system is responsible for the safe distribution of digital content, however, DRM system is achieved with individual function modules of cryptography, watermarking and so on. EOS In this typical system flow, it has a problem that all original digital contents are temporarily disclosed with perfect condition via decryption process. EOS In this paper, we propose the combination of the differential codes and fragile fingerprinting (DCFF) method based on incomplete cryptography that holds promise for a better compromise between practicality and security for emerging digital rights management applications.	Experimental results with simulation confirmed that DCFF keeps compatibility with standard JPEG codec, and revealed that the proposed method is suitable for DRM in the network distribution system.

Nonlinear response and the Burnett equations EOS The time-independent projection-operator formalism of Brey et al [Physica 109A, 425-444 (1981)] for the derivation of Burnett equations is extended and considered in the context of multispecies and magnetized plasmas. EOS The procedure provides specific formulas for the transport coefficients in terms of two-time correlation functions involving both two and three phase-space points. EOS It is shown how to calculate those correlation functions in the limit of weak coupling. EOS The results are used to demonstrate, with the aid of a particular nontrivial example, that previously derived formulas from the two-time formalism [J. EOS J. EOS Brey, J. EOS Chem. EOS Phys. EOS 79, 4585-598 (1983)] are consistent with the Chapman-Enskog methodology employed later by Catto & Simakov (CS) [Phys.

EOS The measurement of isolated prompt photon production in PbPb collisions provides a test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) and the information to constrain the nuclear parton distribution functions.	CMS has shown photon purity measurement capabilities in pp collisions using the shower shape templates.

doc	Grad-Shafranov equation in noncircular stationary axisymmetric spacetimes EOS A formulation is developed for general relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamics in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes. EOS We reduce basic equations to a single second-order partial differential equation, the so-called Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation.	Our formulation is most general in the sense that it is applicable even when a stationary axisymmetric spacetime is noncircular, that is, even when it is impossible to foliate a spacetime with two orthogonal families of two-surfaces.
doc	Transport phenomena in a free-standing two-dimensional sodium sheet EOS The advances in the growth techniques provide numerous scope to explore the possibilities of new 2D materials for potential applications. EOS With the aid of first-principle calculations we show that 2D Na can be a new addition to the family of thermodynamically stable 2D materials for device applications. EOS Not surprisingly, due to half-occupied _EQN_ orbital 2D Na possesses the features of the 2D electron gas (2DEG). EOS The transport properties are examined based on the accurate solution of Boltzmann transport equation. EOS With practically tunable carrier density in 2D materials, the intrinsic electrical resistivity of electron doped 2D Na is _EQN_ 1.4 times larger than that of graphene and falls below the latter 450 K onwards. EOS The Bloch-Gr\"uneisen temperature is almost constant at 50 K, independent of the type or density of the charge carriers.	The electronic thermal conductivity of pure 2D Na is _EQN_ 1.24 times larger than that of its bulk counterpart at 300 K.
doc	A PSO Approach for Optimum Design of Multivariable PID Controller for nonlinear systems EOS The aim of this research is to design a PID Controller using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. EOS The conventional gain tuning of PID controller (such as Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) method) usually produces a big overshoot, and therefore modern heuristics approach such as PSO are employed to enhance the capability of traditional techniques. EOS However, due to the computational efficiency, only PSO will be used in this paper.	The results show the advantage of the PID tuning using PSO-based optimization approach.
doc	Tree crowns grow into self-similar shapes controlled by gravity and light sensing EOS Plants have developed different tropisms: in particular, they re-orient the growth of their branches towards light (phototropism) or upwards (gravitropism). EOS How these tropisms affect the shape of a tree crown remains unanswered. EOS We address this question by developing a propagating front model of tree growth.	This model being length-free, it leads to self-similar solutions, independent of the initial conditions, at long time.

doc	Pseudoachromatic and connected-pseudoachromatic indices of the complete graph EOS A complete _EQN_ -coloring of a graph _EQN_ is a (not necessarily proper) _EQN_ -coloring of the vertices of _EQN_, such that each pair of different colors appears in an edge. EOS A complete _EQN_ -coloring is also called connected, if each color class induces a connected subgraph of _EQN_. EOS The pseudoachromatic index of a graph _EQN_, denoted by _EQN_, is the largest _EQN_ for which the line graph of _EQN_ has a complete _EQN_ -coloring. EOS Analogously the connected-pseudoachromatic index of _EQN_, denoted by _EQN_, is the largest _EQN_ for which the line graph of _EQN_ has a connected and complete _EQN_ -coloring. EOS In this paper we study these two parameters for the complete graph _EQN_. EOS Our main contribution is to improve the linear lower bound for the connected pseudoachromatic index given by Abrams and Berman [Australas J Combin 60 (2014), 314--324] and provide an upper bound.	These two bounds prove that for any integer _EQN_ the order of _EQN_ is _EQN_.

doc	Ergodic theorems for laminations and foliations: recent results and perspectives EOS This report discusses recent results as well as new perspectives in the ergodic theory for Riemann surface laminations, with an emphasis on singular holomorphic foliations by curves. EOS The central notions of these developments are leafwise Poincar\'e metric, directed positive harmonic currents, multiplicative cocycles and Lyapunov exponents. EOS We deal with various ergodic theorems for such laminations: Random and Operator Ergodic Theorems, (Geometric) Birkhoff Ergodic Theorems, Oseledec Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem and Unique Ergodicity Theorems. EOS Applications of these theorems are also given.	In particular, we define and study the canonical Lyapunov exponents for a large family of singular holomorphic foliations on compact projective surfaces.
doc	Monolithic CMOS-compatible zero-index metamaterials EOS Zero-index materials exhibit exotic optical properties that can be utilized for integrated-optics applications. EOS However, practical implementation requires compatibility with complementary metallic-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. EOS We demonstrate a CMOS-compatible zero-index metamaterial consisting of a square array of air holes in a 220-nm-thick silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. EOS This design is achieved through a Dirac-cone dispersion.	The metamaterial is entirely composed of silicon and offers compatibility through low-aspect-ratio structures that can be simply fabricated in a standard device layer.
doc	Evading the Lyth Bound in Hybrid Natural Inflation EOS Generically, the gravitational-wave or tensor-mode contribution to the primordial curvature spectrum of inflation is tiny if the field-range of the inflaton is much smaller than the Planck scale. EOS We show that this pessimistic conclusion is naturally avoided in a rather broad class of small-field models. EOS More specifically, we consider models where an axion-like shift symmetry keeps the inflaton potential flat (up to non-perturbative cosine-shaped modulations), but inflation nevertheless ends in a waterfall-regime, as is typical for hybrid inflation. EOS In such hybrid natural inflation scenarios (examples are provided by Wilson line inflation and fluxbrane inflation), the slow-roll parameter _EQN_ can be sizable during an early period (relevant for the CMB spectrum). EOS Subsequently, _EQN_ quickly becomes very small before the tachyonic instability eventually terminates the slow roll regime.	In this scenario, one naturally generates a considerable tensor-mode contribution in the curvature spectrum, collecting nevertheless the required amount of e-foldings during the final period of inflation.
doc	Ground and space-based study of two globular cluster CVs: M22 CV1 and M5 V101 EOS As a class of compact binaries with large binding energy, cataclysmic variables formed through close encounters play an important role in the dynamical evolution of globular clusters. EOS As part of a systematic search for CVs undergoing dwarf nova eruptions in globular clusters, our 2004 monitoring programme of M22 detected an outburst of the dwarf nova candidate CV1 during May.	We implement the ISIS image subtraction routine to obtain a light curve for an outburst of CV1.
doc	Mean shear flows generated by nonlinear resonant Alfven waves EOS In the context of resonant absorption, nonlinearity has two different manifestations. EOS The first is the reduction in amplitude of perturbations around the resonant point (wave energy absorption). EOS The second is the generation of mean shear flows outside the dissipative layer surrounding the resonant point. EOS Ruderman et al [Phys. EOS Plasmas 4, 75 (1997)] studied both these effects at the slow resonance in isotropic plasmas. EOS Clack et al [Astron. EOS Astrophys. EOS 494, 317 (2009)] investigated nonlinearity at the Alfven resonance, however, they did not include the generation of mean shear flow. EOS In this present paper, we investigate the mean shear flow, analytically, and study its properties. EOS We find that the flow generated is parallel to the magnetic surfaces and has a characteristic velocity proportional to _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the dimensionless amplitude of perturbations far away from the resonance. EOS This is, qualitatively, similar to the flow generated at the slow resonance. EOS The jumps in the derivatives of the parallel and perpendicular components of mean shear flow across the dissipative layer are derived. EOS We estimate the generated mean shear flow to be of the order of _EQN_ in both the solar upper chromosphere and solar corona, however, this value strongly depends on the choice of boundary conditions.	It is proposed that the generated mean shear flow can produce a Kelvin--Helmholtz instability at the dissipative layer which can create turbulent motions.
doc	Relaxation and Creep in Twist and Flexure + Addendum to <<Relaxation and Creep in Twist and Flexure>> EOS The aim of the paper is to derive the exact analytical expressions for torsion and bending creep of rods with the Norton-Bailey, Garofalo and Naumenko-Altenbach-Gorash constitutive models. EOS These simple constitutive models, for example, the time- and strain-hardening constitutive equations, were based on adaptations for time-varying stress of equally simple models for the secondary creep stage from constant load/stress uniaxial tests where minimum creep rate is constant.	The analytical solution is studied for Norton-Bailey and Garofalo laws in uniaxial states of stress.

doc	Aggregation and settling in aqueous polydisperse alumina nanoparticle suspensions EOS Nanoparticle suspensions (also called nanofluids) are often polydisperse and tend to settle with time. EOS Settling kinetics in these systems are known to be complex and hence challenging to understand. EOS In this work, polydisperse spherical alumina (Al2O3) nanoparticles in the size range of ~10-100nm were dispersed in water and examined for aggregation and settling behaviour near its isoelectric point (IEP). EOS A series of settling experiments were conducted and the results were analysed by photography and by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS).	The settling curve obtained from standard bed height measurement experiments indicated two different types of behaviour, both of which were also seen in the SAXS data.

doc	Hermitian Analyticity, IR/UV Mixing and Unitarity of Noncommutative Field Theories EOS The IR/UV mixing and the violation of unitarity are two of the most intriguing aspects of noncommutative quantum field theories. EOS In this paper the relation between these two phenomena is explained and established. EOS We start out by showing that the S-matrix of noncommutative field theories is hermitian analytic. EOS As a consequence, a noncommutative field theory is unitary if the discontinuities of its Feynman diagram amplitudes agree with the expressions calculated using the Cutkosky formulae. EOS These unitarity constraints relate the discontinuities of amplitudes with physical intermediate states;	and allow us to see how the IR/UV mixing may lead to a breakdown of unitarity.
doc	What Role Do Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Play in Multi-Antenna Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access? EOS Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are two key techniques for enabling massive connectivity in future wireless networks. EOS A massive MIMO-NOMA system can deliver remarkable spectral improvements and low communication latency. EOS Nevertheless, the uncontrollable stochastic behavior of the wireless channels can still degrade its performance. EOS In this context, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has arisen as a promising technology for smartly overcoming the harmful effects of the wireless environment. EOS The disruptive IRS concept of controlling the propagation channels via software can provide attractive performance gains to the communication networks, including higher data rates, improved user fairness, and, possibly, higher energy efficiency.	In this article, in contrast to the existing literature, we demonstrate the main roles of IRSs in MIMO-NOMA systems.

EOS Fix admissible irreducible tempered representations _EQN_ and _EQN_ of _EQN_ and _EQN_ respectively. EOS We assume that _EQN_ and _EQN_ are conjugate-dual. EOS That is to say _EQN_ and _EQN_) where _EQN_ is the non trivial _EQN_ -automorphism of _EQN_. EOS This implies, we can extend _EQN_ to an unitary representation _EQN_ of a nonconnected group _EQN_. EOS Define _EQN_ the same way. EOS We state and prove an integral formula for _EQN_ involving the characters of _EQN_ and _EQN_.	This formula is related to the local Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for unitary groups.

EOS Three eclipses were observed, revealing considerable variation in the eclipse shape, particularly during ingress.	The eclipse shape is shown to be understood in terms of AM Her accretion via a bright stream, with very little contribution from the white dwarf photosphere and/or hotspot.

doc	Age and Mass for 920 LMC Clusters Derived from 100 Million Monte Carlo Simulations EOS We present new age and mass estimates for 920 stellar clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) based on previously published broad-band photometry and the stellar cluster analysis package, MASSCLEANage. EOS Expressed in the generic fitting formula, d^ 2 N/dM dt ~ M^ \alpha t^ \beta, the distribution of observed clusters is described by \alpha = -1.5 to -1.6 and \beta = -2.1 to -2.2. EOS For 288 of these clusters, ages have recently been determined based on stellar photometric color-magnitude diagrams, allowing us to gauge the confidence of our ages. EOS The results look very promising, opening up the possibility that this sample of 920 clusters, with reliable and consistent age, mass and photometric measures, might be used to constrain important characteristics about the stellar cluster population in the LMC.	We also investigate a traditional age determination method that uses a \chi^2 minimization routine to fit observed cluster colors to standard infinite mass limit simple stellar population models.

doc	Anomalies in bulk supercooled water at negative pressure EOS Water is the most familiar liquid, and arguably the most complex. EOS Anomalies of supercooled water have been measured during decades, and competing interpretations proposed. EOS Yet, a decisive experiment remains elusive, because of unavoidable crystallization into ice. EOS We investigate the state of water that is both supercooled and under mechanical tension, or negative pressure. EOS Liquids under negative pressure can be found in plants or fluid inclusions in minerals. EOS Using such water inclusions in quartz, we report the first measurements on doubly metastable water down to _EQN_ and around _EQN_. EOS We observe sound velocity anomalies that can be reproduced quantitatively with molecular dynamics simulations.	These results rule out one proposed scenario for water anomalies, and put further constraints on the remaining ones.
doc	Gaia Data Release 1: The variability processing & analysis and its application to the south ecliptic pole region EOS The ESA Gaia mission provides a unique time-domain survey for more than one billion sources brighter than G=20.7 mag. EOS Gaia offers the unprecedented opportunity to study variability phenomena in the Universe thanks to multi-epoch G-magnitude photometry in addition to astrometry, blue and red spectro-photometry, and spectroscopy. EOS Within the Gaia Consortium, Coordination Unit 7 has the responsibility to detect variable objects, classify them, derive characteristic parameters for specific variability classes, and provide global descriptions of variable phenomena. EOS We describe the variability processing and analysis that we plan to apply to the successive data releases, and we present its application to the G-band photometry results of the first 14 months of Gaia operations that comprises 28 days of Ecliptic Pole Scanning Law and 13 months of Nominal Scanning Law. EOS Out of the 694 million, all-sky, sources that have calibrated G-band photometry in this first stage of the mission, about 2.3 million sources that have at least 20 observations are located within 38 degrees from the South Ecliptic Pole. EOS We detect about 14% of them as variable candidates, among which the automated classification identified 9347 Cepheid and RR Lyrae candidates. EOS Additional visual inspections and selection criteria led to the publication of 3194 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, described in Clementini et al (2016). EOS Under the restrictive conditions for DR1, the completenesses of Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars are estimated at 67% and 58%, respectively, numbers that will significantly increase with subsequent Gaia data releases. EOS Data processing within the Gaia Consortium is iterative, the quality of the data and the results being improved at each iteration.	The results presented in this article show a glimpse of the exceptional harvest that is to be expected from the Gaia mission for variability phenomena.

EOS In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning spatial and attentional convolution neural networks on arbitrary graphs. EOS Different from previous convolutional neural networks on graphs, we first design a motif-matching guided subgraph normalization method to capture neighborhood information.	Then we implement subgraph-level self-attentional layers to learn different importances from different subgraphs to solve graph classification problems.
doc	BERT-CNN: a Hierarchical Patent Classifier Based on a Pre-Trained Language Model EOS The automatic classification is a process of automatically assigning text documents to predefined categories. EOS An accurate automatic patent classifier is crucial to patent inventors and patent examiners in terms of intellectual property protection, patent management, and patent information retrieval. EOS We present BERT-CNN, a hierarchical patent classifier based on pre-trained language model by training the national patent application documents collected from the State Information Center, China. EOS The experimental results show that BERT-CNN achieves 84.3% accuracy, which is far better than the two compared baseline methods, Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks. EOS We didn't apply our model to the third and fourth hierarchical level of the International Patent Classification - "subclass" and "group".The visualization of the Attention Mechanism shows that BERT-CNN obtains new state-of-the-art results in representing vocabularies and semantics.	This article demonstrates the practicality and effectiveness of BERT-CNN in the field of automatic patent classification.
doc	Sedna and the Oort Cloud Around a Migrating Sun EOS Recent numerical simulations have demonstrated that the Sun's dynamical history within the Milky Way may be much more complex than that suggested by its current low peculiar velocity. EOS In particular, the Sun may have radially migrated through the galactic disk by up to 5-6 kpc. EOS This has important ramifications for the structure of the Oort Cloud, as it means that the solar system may have experienced tidal and stellar perturbations that were significantly different from its current local galactic environment. EOS To characterize the effects of solar migration within the Milky Way, we use direct numerical simulations to model the formation of an Oort Cloud around stars that end up on solar-type orbits in a galactic-scale simulation of a Milky Way-like disk formation.	Surprisingly, our simulations indicate that Sedna's orbit may belong to the classical Oort Cloud.
doc	A variable ultra-luminous X-ray source in the colliding galaxy NGC 7714 EOS We studied the colliding galaxy NGC 7714 with two XMM-Newton observations, six months apart. EOS The galaxy contains two bright X-ray sources: we show that they have different physical nature. EOS The off-nuclear source is an accreting compact object, one of the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) found to date. EOS It showed spectral and luminosity changes between the two observations, from a low/soft to a high/hard state; EOS in the high state, it reached L_x ~ 6 x 10^ 40 erg/s. EOS Its lightcurve in the high state suggests variability on a ~ 2-hr timescale.	Its peculiar location, where the tidal bridge between NGC 7714 and NGC 7715 joins the outer stellar ring of NGC 7714, makes it an interesting example of the connection between gas flows in colliding galaxies and ULX formation.
doc	Dynamical calculation of third harmonic generation in a semiconductor quantum well EOS Non-linear phenomena in optically excited semiconductor structures are of high interest. EOS We here develop a model capable of studying the dynamics of the photoexcited carriers, including Coulomb interaction on a Hartree-Fock level, on the same footing as the dynamics of the light field impinging on an arbitrary photonic structure. EOS Applying this method to calculate the third harmonic generation in a semiconductor quantum well embedded in a Bragg mirror structure, we find that the power-law exponent of the intensity dependence of the third harmonic generation depends on the frequency of the exciting pulse.	Off-resonant pulses follow the expected cubic dependence, while the exponent is smaller for resonant pulses due to saturation effects in the induced carrier density.
doc	Tunable deconfined quantum criticality and interplay of different valence-bond solid phases EOS We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a quantum _EQN_ spin model with competing multi-spin interactions. EOS We find a quantum phase transition between a columnar valence-bond solid (cVBS) and a N\'eel antiferromagnet (AFM), as in the scenario of deconfined quantum-critical points, as well as a transition between the AFM and a staggered valence-bond solid (sVBS). EOS By continuously varying a parameter, the sVBS--AFM and AFM--cVBS boundaries merge into a direct sVBS--cVBS transition.	Unlike previous models with putative deconfined AFM--cVBS transitions, e.g., the standard _EQN_ - _EQN_ model, in our extended _EQN_ - _EQN_ model with competing cVBS and sVBS inducing terms the transition can be tuned from continuous to first-order.
doc	On the Calculation of Fundamental Groups in Homotopy Type Theory by Means of Computational Paths EOS One of the most interesting entities of homotopy type theory is the identity type. EOS It gives rise to an interesting interpretation of the equality, since one can semantically interpret the equality between two terms of the same type as a collection of homotopical paths between points of the same space. EOS Since this is only a semantical interpretation, the addition of paths to the syntax of homotopy type theory has been recently proposed by De Queiroz, Ramos and De Oliveira. EOS In these works, the authors propose an entity known as `computational path', proposed by De Queiroz and Gabbay in 1994, and show that it can be used to formalize the identity type. EOS We have found that it is possible to use these computational paths as a tool to achieve one central result of algebraic topology and homotopy type theory: the calculation of fundamental groups of surfaces. EOS We review the concept of computational paths and the _EQN_, which is a term rewriting system proposed by De Oliveira in 1994 to map redundancies between computational paths.	We then proceed to calculate the fundamental group of the circle, cylinder, M \"o bius band, torus and the real projective plane.

Each CTA array will include four Large Size Telescopes (LSTs), designed to cover the low-energy range of the CTA sensitivity (_EQN_ 20 GeV to 200 GeV).
doc	Static Quantities of the W-Boson in the MSSM EOS We systematically analyze the anomalous dipole _EQN_ and quadrupole _EQN_ moments of the W gauge bosons in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model as functions of the soft SUSY breaking parameters _EQN_ and the top quark mass. EOS The severe constraints imposed by the radiative breaking mechanism of the electroweak symmetry\, _EQN_ \, are duly taken into account. EOS The supesymmetric values of _EQN_ and _EQN_ can be largely different, in some cases, from the standard model predictions but of the same order of magnitude for values of \quad _EQN_. EOS Therefore possible supersymmetric structure can be probed provided the accuracy of measurements for _EQN_, _EQN_ reaches _EQN_ and hence hard to be detected at LEP2. EOS If deviations from the standard model predictions are observed at LEP2, most likely these are not due to an underlying supersymmetric structure. EOS In cases where _EQN_, the charginos and neutralinos may give substantial contributions saturating the LEP2 sensitivity limits. EOS This occurs when their masses _EQN_ turn out to be both light satisfying _EQN_.	However these extreme cases are perturbatively untrustworthy and besides unnatural for they occupy a small region in the parameter space.

doc	Fusion categories and homotopy theory EOS We apply the yoga of classical homotopy theory to classification problems of G-extensions of fusion and braided fusion categories, where G is a finite group. EOS Namely, we reduce such problems to classification (up to homotopy) of maps from BG to classifiying spaces of certain higher groupoids. EOS In particular, to every fusion category C we attach the 3-groupoid BrPic(C) of invertible C-bimodule categories, called the Brauer-Picard groupoid of C, such that equivalence classes of G-extensions of C are in bijection with homotopy classes of maps from BG to the classifying space of BrPic(C). EOS This gives rise to an explicit description of both the obstructions to existence of extensions and the data parametrizing them; EOS we work these out both topologically and algebraically.	One of the central results of the paper is that the 2-truncation of BrPic(C) is canonically the 2-groupoid of braided autoequivalences of the Drinfeld center Z(C) of C.

doc	A first principles analysis of the Colossal Ion Conductivity cubic Zirconia structural hypothesis and disorder, mechanics, and space charge mechanistic hypotheses EOS Colossal Ion Conductivity (CIC) is the phenomenon in which large changes in oxygen conductivity are observed when a solid state oxygen electrolyte is placed in a heterolayer super lattice. EOS Several hypotheses have been posed concerning both structural changes of the ion conducting material and of the ion conducting mechanism. EOS The posed structural hypotheses are oxygen sub lattice melting, phase change of the ion conducting material, and that the heterolayer environment does not induce a phase change of the ion conducting material. EOS The posed mechanistic hypotheses are disorder, mechanics, and space charge. EOS Here, first principles molecular dynamics and statics of the ion conducting interface are performed providing evidence that under CIC conditions no sub lattice melting nor phase change has occurred and that the electrolyte remains unchanged. EOS A discussion of the posed mechanistic hypotheses is given and cast as a series of mathematical statements. EOS When these hypotheses are compared with first principles calculations and literature results, they fail to capture CIC;	a new alternative dipole hypothesis is offered, which also fails to capture CIC;

doc	Surface and oceanic habitability of Trappist-1 planets under the impact of flares EOS The discovery of potentially habitable planets around the ultracool dwarf star Trappist-1 naturally poses the question: could Trappist-1 planets be home to life? EOS These planets orbit very close to the host star and are most susceptible to the UV radiation emitted by the intense and frequent flares of Trappist-1. EOS Here we calculate the UV spectra (100 - 450 nm) of a superflare observed on Trappist-1 with the K2 mission. EOS We couple radiative transfer models to this spectra to estimate the UV surface flux on planets in the habitable zone of Trappist-1 (planets _EQN_, _EQN_, and _EQN_), assuming atmospheric scenarios based on a pre-biotic and an oxygenic atmosphere. EOS We quantify the impact of the UV radiation on living organisms on the surface and on a hypothetical planet ocean. EOS Finally, we find that for non-oxygenic planets, UV resistant lifeforms would survive on the surface of planets f and g. EOS Nevertheless, more fragile organisms (i.e. EOS \textit E.	coli) could be protected from the hazardous UV effects at ocean depths greater than 8m.
doc	Ion heating, burnout of the HF field and ion sound generation under the development of a modulation instability of an intense Langmuir wave in a plasma EOS The development of one-dimensional parametric instabilities of intense long-wave plasma waves is considered in terms of the so-called hybrid models, when electrons are treated as a fluid and ions are regarded as particles.	The analysis is performed for both cases when the average plasma field energy is lower (Zakharov's hybrid model -- ZHM) or greater (Silin's hybrid model -- SHM) than the plasma thermal energy.
doc	There are no non-zero Stable Fixed Points for dense networks in the homogeneous Kuramoto model EOS This paper is concerned with the existence of multiple stable fixed point solutions of the homogeneous Kuramoto model. EOS We develop a necessary condition for the existence of stable fixed points for the general network Kuramoto model. EOS This condition is applied to show that for sufficiently dense n-node networks, with node degrees at least 0.9395(n-1), the homogeneous (equal frequencies) model has no non-zero stable fixed point solution over the full space of phase angles in the range -Pi to Pi.	This result together with existing research proves a conjecture of Verwoerd and Mason (2007) that for the complete network and homogeneous model the zero fixed point has a basin of attraction consisting of the entire space minus a set of measure zero.

doc	Blind Image Restoration without Prior Knowledge EOS Many image restoration techniques are highly dependent on the degradation used during training, and their performance declines significantly when applied to slightly different input. EOS Blind and universal techniques attempt to mitigate this by producing a trained model that can adapt to varying conditions. EOS However, blind techniques to date require prior knowledge of the degradation process, and assumptions regarding its parameter-space. EOS In this paper we present the Self-Normalization Side-Chain (SCNC), a novel approach to blind universal restoration in which no prior knowledge of the degradation is needed.

The imaging parameters relevant to the task, as well as their dynamics, are deduced from the variety in the training data.
doc	The gas, metal and dust evolution in low-metallicity local and high-redshift galaxies EOS The chemical enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is regulated by several physical processes: stellar evolution, grain formation and destruction, galactic inflows and outflows. EOS Understanding such processes is essential to follow the chemical enrichment of galaxies through the cosmic epochs, and to interpret the observations. EOS Despite the importance of such topics, the efficiency of the different processes driving the evolution of baryons in galaxies, remain controversial. EOS We revise the current description of metal and dust evolution in local low-metallicity dwarf galaxies and we develop a description for Lyman Break Galaxies. EOS Our main goal is to reproduce i) the peak in the mass of dust over the mass of stars (sMdust) observed within few hundred Myrs;	ii) the decrease of the sMdust at later time.

doc	Systems of Linear Equations over _EQN_ and Problems Parameterized Above Average EOS In the problem Max Lin, we are given a system _EQN_ of _EQN_ linear equations with _EQN_ variables over _EQN_ in which each equation is assigned a positive weight and we wish to find an assignment of values to the variables that maximizes the excess, which is the total weight of satisfied equations minus the total weight of falsified equations. EOS Using an algebraic approach, we obtain a lower bound for the maximum excess. EOS Max Lin Above Average (Max Lin AA) is a parameterized version of Max Lin introduced by Mahajan et al (Proc. EOS IWPEC'06 and J. EOS Comput. EOS Syst. EOS Sci. EOS 75, 2009). EOS In Max Lin AA all weights are integral and we are to decide whether the maximum excess is at least _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the parameter. EOS It is not hard to see that we may assume that no two equations in _EQN_ have the same left-hand side and _EQN_.	Using our maximum excess results, we prove that, under these assumptions, Max Lin AA is fixed-parameter tractable for a wide special case: _EQN_ for an arbitrary fixed function _EQN_.
doc	Simple approximate analytical solution for non-isothermal single-step transformations: kinetic analysis EOS In this paper, we develop a method for obtaining the approximate solution for the evolution of single-step transformations under non-isothermal conditions. EOS We have applied it to many reaction models and obtained very simple analytical expressions for the shape of the corresponding transformation rate peaks.	These analytical solutions represent a significant simplification of the system's description allowing easy curve fitting to experiment.

doc	Strain tuning of a quantum dot strongly coupled to a photonic crystal cavity EOS We demonstrate reversible strain-tuning of a quantum dot strongly coupled to a photonic crystal cavity. EOS We observe an average redshift of 0.45 nm for quantum dots located inside the cavity membrane, achieved with an electric field of 15 kV/cm applied to a piezo-electric actuator.	Using this technique, we demonstrate the ability to tune a quantum dot into resonance with a photonic crystal cavity in the strong coupling regime, resulting in a clear anti-crossing.
doc	Can we measure the slopes of density profiles in dwarf spheroidal galaxies? EOS Using collisionless N-body simulations of dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way (MW) we construct realistic models of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies of the Local Group. EOS The dwarfs are initially composed of stellar disks embedded in dark matter haloes with different inner density slopes and are placed on an eccentric orbit typical for MW subhaloes. EOS After a few Gyr of evolution the stellar component is triaxial as a result of bar instability induced by tidal forces. EOS Observing the simulated dwarfs along three principal axes of the stellar component we create mock data sets and determine the their half-light radii and line-of-sight velocity dispersions. EOS Using the estimator proposed by Wolf et al we calculate masses within half-light radii. EOS The masses obtained this way are over(under)estimated by up to a factor of two when the line of sight is along the longest (shortest) axis of the stellar component. EOS We then divide the initial stellar distribution into an inner and outer population and trace their evolution in time. EOS The two populations, although affected by tidal forces, retain different density profiles even after a few Gyr. EOS We measure the half-light radii and velocity dispersions of the stars in the two populations along different lines of sight and use them to estimate the slope of the mass distribution in the dwarfs following the method proposed by Walker & Penarrubia.	The inferred slopes are systematically over- or underestimated, depending on the line of sight.
doc	Comparison of post-Newtonian templates for extreme mass ratio inspirals EOS Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the inspirals of compact objects into supermassive black holes, are important gravitational wave sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). EOS We study the performance of various post-Newtonian (PN) template families relative to the high precision numerical waveforms in the context of EMRI parameter estimation with LISA. EOS Expressions for the time domain waveforms TaylorT1, TaylorT2, TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt are derived up to 22PN order, i.e _EQN_ (_EQN_ is the characteristic velocity of the binary) beyond the Newtonian term, for a test particle in a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. EOS The phase difference between the above 22PN waveform families and numerical waveforms are evaluated during two-year inspirals for two prototypical EMRI systems with mass ratios _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS We find that the dephases (in radians) for TaylorT1 and TaylorT2, respectively, are about _EQN_ (_EQN_) and _EQN_ (_EQN_) for mass ratio _EQN_ (_EQN_). EOS This suggests that using 22PN TaylorT1 or TaylorT2 waveforms for parameter estimation of EMRIs will result in accuracies comparable to numerical waveform accuracy for most of the LISA parameter space. EOS On the other hand, from the dephase results, we find that TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt fare relatively poorly as one approaches the last stable orbit. EOS This implies that, as for comparable mass binaries using the 3.5PN phase of waveforms, the 22PN TaylorT3 and TaylorEt approximants do not perform well enough for the EMRIs.	The reason underlying the poor performance of TaylorT3, TaylorT4 and TaylorEt relative to TaylorT1 and TaylorT2 is finally examined.
doc	Reduction of Couplings and Finiteness in Realistic Supersymmetric GUTs EOS Reduction of couplings in supersymmetric GUTs is achieved by searching for renormalization group invariant (RGI) relations among couplings which hold beyond the unification scale. EOS Finiteness is due to the fact that there exist RGI relations among couplings that guarantee the vanishing of the beta-functions of a N=1 supersymmetric GUT even to all orders in perturbation theory.	Of particular interest are the relations among gauge and Yukawa couplings which lead to very interesting predictions of the top quark mass

doc	Adiabatic quantum computation along quasienergies EOS The parametric deformations of quasienergies and eigenvectors of unitary operators are applied to the design of quantum adiabatic algorithms. EOS The conventional, standard adiabatic quantum computation proceeds along eigenenergies of parameter-dependent Hamiltonians. EOS By contrast, discrete adiabatic computation utilizes adiabatic passage along the quasienergies of parameter-dependent unitary operators. EOS For example, such computation can be realized by a concatenation of parameterized quantum circuits, with an adiabatic though inevitably discrete change of the parameter. EOS A design principle of adiabatic passage along quasienergy is recently proposed: Cheon's quasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies on unitary operators is available to realize anholonomic adiabatic algorithms [Tanaka and Miyamoto, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS 98, 160407 (2007)], which compose a nontrivial family of discrete adiabatic algorithms. EOS It is straightforward to port a standard adiabatic algorithm to an anholonomic adiabatic one, except an introduction of a parameter |v>, which is available to adjust the gaps of the quasienergies to control the running time steps.	In Grover's database search problem, the costs to prepare |v> for the qualitatively different, i.e., power or exponential, running time steps are shown to be qualitatively different.

doc	Spiral Chains: The Proofs of Tait's and Tutte's Three-Edge-Coloring Conjectures EOS In this paper we have shown without assuming the four color theorem of planar graphs that every (bridgeless) cubic planar graph has a three-edge-coloring. EOS This is an old-conjecture due to Tait in the squeal of efforts in settling the four-color conjecture at the end of the 19th century. EOS We have also shown the applicability of our method to another well-known three edge-coloring conjecture on cubic graphs.	Namely Tutte's conjecture that "every 2-connected cubic graph with no Petersen minor is 3-edge colorable".
doc	On the intermittency front of stochastic heat equation driven by colored noises EOS We study the propagation of high peaks (intermittency front) of the solution to a stochastic heat equation driven by multiplicative centered Gaussian noise in _EQN_. EOS The noise is assumed to have a general homogeneous covariance in both time and space, and the solution is interpreted in the senses of the Wick product.	We give some estimates for the upper and lower bounds of the propagation speed, based on a moment formula of the solution.
doc	N=2 minimal conformal field theories and matrix bifactorisations of x^d EOS We prove a tensor equivalence between full subcategories of a) graded matrix factorisations of the potential x^d-y^d and b) representations of the N=2 minimal super vertex operator algebra at central charge 3-6/d, where d is odd. EOS The subcategories are given by a) permutation-type matrix factorisations with consecutive index sets, and b) Neveu-Schwarz-type representations.	The physical motivation for this result is the Landau-Ginzburg / conformal field theory correspondence, where it amounts to the equivalence of a subset of defects on both sides of the correspondence.
doc	Polynomial Bottleneck Congestion Games with Optimal Price of Anarchy EOS We study bottleneck congestion games where the social cost is determined by the worst congestion of any resource. EOS These games directly relate to network routing problems and also job-shop scheduling problems. EOS In typical bottleneck congestion games, the utility costs of the players are determined by the worst congested resources that they use. EOS However, the resulting Nash equilibria are inefficient, since the price of anarchy is proportional on the number of resources which can be high. EOS Here we show that we can get smaller price of anarchy with the bottleneck social cost metric. EOS We introduce the polynomial bottleneck games where the utility costs of the players are polynomial functions of the congestion of the resources that they use. EOS In particular, the delay function for any resource _EQN_ is _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the congestion measured as the number of players that use _EQN_, and _EQN_ is an integer constant that defines the degree of the polynomial.	The utility cost of a player is the sum of the individual delays of the resources that it uses.
doc	Probing the evolving massive star population in Orion with kinematic and radioactive tracers EOS We assemble a census of the most massive stars in Orion, then use stellar isochrones to estimate their masses and ages, and use these results to establish the stellar content of Orion's individual OB associations. EOS From this, our new population synthesis code is utilized to derive the history of the emission of UV radiation and kinetic energy of the material ejected by the massive stars, and also follow the ejection of the long-lived radioactive isotopes 26Al and 60Fe. EOS In order to estimate the precision of our method, we compare and contrast three distinct representations of the massive stars. EOS We compare the expected outputs with observations of 26Al gamma-ray signal and the extent of the Eridanus cavity.	We find an integrated kinetic energy emitted by the massive stars of 1.8(+1.5-0.4)times 10^52 erg.
doc	Similarity Measures, Author Cocitation Analysis, and Information Theory EOS The use of Pearson's correlation coefficient in Author Cocitation Analysis was compared with Salton's cosine measure in a number of recent contributions.

Information calculus is based on both the logarithmic transformation and provides a non-parametric statistics.

EOS In order to check this new value using AGN spectra we present the measurements of the flux ratio of the [OIII] 4959,5007 emission lines for a sample of 62 AGN, obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Database and from published observations.	We select only high signal-to-noise ratio spectra for which the line shapes of the [OIII] 4959,5007 lines are the same.
doc	Active network management for electrical distribution systems: problem formulation, benchmark, and approximate solution EOS With the increasing share of renewable and distributed generation in electrical distribution systems, Active Network Management (ANM) becomes a valuable option for a distribution system operator to operate his system in a secure and cost-effective way without relying solely on network reinforcement. EOS ANM strategies are short-term policies that control the power injected by generators and/or taken off by loads in order to avoid congestion or voltage issues. EOS Advanced ANM strategies imply that the system operator has to solve large-scale optimal sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.	For example, decisions taken at a given moment constrain the future decisions that can be taken and uncertainty must be explicitly accounted for because neither demand nor generation can be accurately forecasted.

doc	Physical and mathematical justification of the numerical Brillouin zone integration of the Boltzmann rate equation by Gaussian smearing EOS Scatterings of electrons at quasiparticles or photons are very important for many topics in solid state physics, e.g., spintronics, magnonics or photonics, and therefore a correct numerical treatment of these scatterings is very important. EOS For a quantum-mechanical description of these scatterings Fermi's golden rule is used in order to calculate the transition rate from an initial state to a final state in a first-order time-dependent perturbation theory. EOS One can calculate the total transition rate from all initial states to all final states with Boltzmann rate equations involving Brillouin zone integrations. EOS The numerical treatment of these integrations on a finite grid is often done via a replacement of the Dirac delta distribution by a Gaussian.	The Dirac delta distribution appears in Fermi's golden rule where it describes the energy conservation among the interacting particles.

doc	Learning to Generate Music with BachProp EOS As deep learning advances, algorithms of music composition increase in performance. EOS However, most of the successful models are designed for specific musical structures. EOS Here, we present BachProp, an algorithmic composer that can generate music scores in many styles given sufficient training data. EOS To adapt BachProp to a broad range of musical styles, we propose a novel representation of music and train a deep network to predict the note transition probabilities of a given music corpus. EOS In this paper, new music scores generated by BachProp are compared with the original corpora as well as with different network architectures and other related models.	We show that BachProp captures important features of the original datasets better than other models and invite the reader to a qualitative comparison on a large collection of generated songs.

EOS In such applications, since the number of samples is restricted, one should deploy the sampling points wisely. EOS We are motivated to study the optimal distribution of finite sampling points. EOS Formulation under the framework of optimal reconstruction yields a minimization problem.	In the discrete case, we estimate the distance between the optimal subspace resulting from a general Karhunen-Loeve transform and the kernel space to obtain another algorithm that is computationally favorable.
doc	The Submillimeter Array 1.3 mm line survey of Arp 220 EOS We present the first aperture synthesis unbiased spectral line survey toward an extragalactic object. EOS The survey covered the 40 GHz frequency range between 202 and 242 GHz of the 1.3 mm atmospheric window. EOS We find that 80% of the observed band shows molecular emission, with 73 features identified from 15 molecular species and 6 isotopologues. EOS The 13C isotopic substitutions of HC3N and transitions from H2(18)O, 29SiO, and CH2CO are detected for the first time outside the Galaxy.	Within the broad observed band, we estimate that 28% of the total measured flux is due to the molecular line contribution, with CO only contributing 9% to the overall flux.
doc	Colorectal cancers differ in respect of PARP-1 protein expression EOS Recent findings raise the possibility of PARP inhibitor therapy in colorectal cancers(CRCs). EOS However, the extent of PARP-1 protein expression in clinical specimens of CRC is not known. EOS Using immunohistochemistry we assessed PARP-1 protein expression in tissue microarrays of 151 CRCs and its association with the patient's age, sex, Astler-Coller stage, grade and site of the tumor. EOS High PARP nuclear immunoreactivity was found in 68.2% (103/151) of all cases. EOS In turn, 31.8% (48/151)of tumors showed low PARP expression, including 9 (6%) PARP-1 negative CRCs. EOS There was a significant association of PARP-1 expression with the site of CRC and Astler-Coller stage. EOS A high PARP expression was noted in 79.1% of colon vs. EOS 53.9% of rectal tumors (p = 0.001). EOS The mean PARP-1 score was 1.27 times higher in colon vs.	rectal cancers (p = 0.009) and it was higher in stage B2 vs.

However, models of human interaction largely ignore this effect.

EOS The direct band gaps lie in the range of 5.6~5.9 eV, corresponding to wavelengths of 210~221 nm.	The dipole matrix elements of direct optical transition are comparable to that of GaN, suggesting that the superlattices are promising materials as an efficient deep ultraviolet light emitter.

EOS This property, if confirmed in gas, may be a definitive solution for the ion back-flow problem in gaseous detectors.	In order to ascertain this aspect, graphene layers of dimensions of about 2x2cm _EQN_, grown on a copper substrate, are transferred onto a flat metal surface with holes, so that the graphene layer is freely suspended.

doc	Antiferromagnetism of the 2D Hubbard Model at Half Filling: Analytic Ground State at Weak Coupling EOS We introduce a local formalism to deal with the Hubbard model on a N times N square lattice (for even N) in terms of eigenstates of number operators, having well defined point symmetry. EOS For U -> 0, the low lying shells of the kinetic energy are filled in the ground state. EOS At half filling, using the 2N-2 one-body states of the partially occupied shell S_ hf, we build a set of (2N-2 N-1)^ 2 degenerate unperturbed ground states with S_ z =0 which are then resolved by the Hubbard interaction _EQN_. EOS In S_ hf we study the many-body eigenstates of the kinetic energy with vanishing eigenvalue of the Hubbard repulsion (W=0 states). EOS In the S_ z =0 sector, this is a N times degenerate multiplet.	From the singlet component one obtains the ground state of the Hubbard model for U=0^ +, which is unique in agreement with a theorem by Lieb.

EOS When a magnetized Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) gas containing _EQN_ atoms is brought into a _EQN_ _EQN_ proximity of the flux qubit in an experimentally realistic geometry, we demonstrate the appearance of a two- to five-fold amplification of _EQN_ over the bare value without the BEC, by calculating the instantion trajectory action from the microscopically derived effective flux Lagrangian of a hybrid quantum system composed of the flux qubit and a spin- _EQN_ atomic Bose gas.	Exploiting the connection between _EQN_ and the maximal metrological usefulness of a multimode superposition state, we show that amplification of _EQN_ in the ground state of the hybrid system is equivalent to a decrease in the quantum Cram\' e r-Rao bound for estimation of an externally applied flux.

doc	Contactless measurement of electrical conductance of a thin film of amorphous germanium EOS We present a contactless method for measuring charge in a thin film of amorphous germanium (a-Ge) with a nanoscale silicon MOSFET charge sensor. EOS This method enables the measurement of conductance of the a-Ge film even in the presence of blocking contacts. EOS At high bias voltage, the resistance of the contacts becomes negligible and a direct measurement of current gives a conductance that agrees with that from the measurement of charge.	This charge-sensing technique is used to measure the temperature- and field-dependence of the conductance, and they both agree with a model of Mott variable-range hopping.
doc	Metallicity of the Intergalactic Medium Using Pixel Statistics: I. Method EOS Studies of absorption spectra of high-z QSOs have revealed that the intergalactic medium at z ~ 2-3 is enriched to ~ 0.1%-1% solar for gas densities more than a few times the mean cosmic density, but have not yet produced an accurate metallicity estimate, nor constrained variations in the metallicity with density, redshift, or spatial location. EOS This paper discusses the ``pixel optical depth'' (POD) method of QSO spectrum analysis, using realistic simulated spectra from cosmological simulations. EOS In this method, absorption in Ly-alpha is compared to corresponding metal absorption on a pixel-by-pixel basis, yielding for each analyzed spectrum a single statistical correlation encoding metal enrichment information. EOS Our simulations allow testing and optimization of each step of the technique's implementation.	Tests show that previous studies have probably been limited by C IV self-contamination and O VI contamination by HI lines;

EOS This model comprises several interesting ensembles (directed site and bond trees, bond animals, strongly embeddable animals) as special cases and its collapse transition is equivalent to a directed bond percolation threshold.	Precise estimates for the animal size exponents in the different phases and for the critical fugacities of these special ensembles are obtained from a phenomenological renormalization group analysis of the correlation lengths for strips of width up to n=17.

doc	Horava-Lifshitz Black Hole Hydrodynamics EOS We consider the holographic hydrodynamics of black holes in generally covariant gravity theories with a preferred time foliation. EOS Gravitational perturbations in these theories have spin two and spin zero helicity modes with generically different speeds. EOS The black hole solutions possess a spacelike causal boundary called the universal horizon. EOS We relate the flux of the spin zero perturbation across the universal horizon to the new dissipative transport in Lifshitz field theory hydrodynamics found in arXiv:1304.7481.	We construct in detail the hydrodynamics of one such black hole solution, and calculate the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density.

doc	Statistical Verification of Hyperproperties for Cyber-Physical System EOS Many important properties of cyber-physical systems (CPS) are defined upon the relationship between multiple executions simultaneously in continuous time. EOS Examples include probabilistic fairness and sensitivity to modeling errors (i.e., parameters changes) for real-valued signals. EOS These requirements can only be specified by hyperproperties. EOS In this work, we focus on verifying probabilistic hyperproperties for CPS. EOS To cover a wide range of modeling formalisms, we first propose a general model of probabilistic uncertain systems (PUSs) that unify commonly studied CPS models such as continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) and probabilistically parametrized Hybrid I/O Automata. EOS To formally specify hyperproperties, we propose a new temporal logic, hyper probabilistic signal temporal logic (HyperPSTL) that serves as a hyper and probabilistic version of the conventional signal temporal logic (STL).	Considering complexity of real-world systems that can be captured as PUSs, we adopt a statistical model checking (SMC) approach for their verification.

doc	Linking Literature and Data: Status Report and Future Efforts EOS In the current era of data-intensive science, it is increasingly important for researchers to be able to have access to published results, the supporting data, and the processes used to produce them. EOS Six years ago, recognizing this need, the American Astronomical Society and the Astrophysics Data Centers Executive Committee (ADEC) sponsored an effort to facilitate the annotation and linking of datasets during the publishing process, with limited success.	I will review the status of this effort and describe a new, more general one now being considered in the context of the Virtual Astronomical Observatory.
doc	Strong-coupling dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well trap EOS Dynamics of the repulsive Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a double-well trap is explored within the 3D time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. EOS The model avoids numerous common approximations (two-mode treatment, time-space factorization, fixed values of the chemical potential and barrier penetrability, etc) and thus provides a realistic description of BEC dynamics, including both weak-coupling (sub-barrier) and strong-coupling (above-barrier) regimes and their crossover. EOS The strong coupling regime is achieved by increasing the number _EQN_ of BEC atoms and thus the chemical potential.	The evolution with _EQN_ of Josephson oscillations (JO) and Macroscopic Quantum Self-Trapping (MQST) is examined and the crucial impact of the BEC interaction is demonstrated.

doc	The Composition and Mineralogy of Rocky Exoplanets: A Survey of >4,000 Stars from the Hypatia Catalog EOS We present a survey of >4,000 star compositions from the Hypatia Catalog to examine whether rocky exoplanets (i.e., those with rocky surfaces, dominated by silicates) might be geologically similar to Earth, at least with respect to composition and mineralogy. EOS To do so, we explore the variety of reported stellar compositions to then determine a possible range of exoplanetary mantle mineralogies. EOS We find that exoplanetary mantles will likely be dominated by olivine and/or orthopyroxene, depending upon Fe partitioning during core formation. EOS Some exoplanets may be magnesiowustite- or quartz-saturated, and we present a new classification scheme based on the weight _EQN_ ratio (FeO+MgO)/SiO _EQN_, to differentiate rock types.	But wholly exotic mineralogies should be rare to absent.

EOS Where possible, we compare to existing lattice QCD calculations.

doc	Discrete Decreasing Minimization, Part II: Views from Discrete Convex Analysis EOS We continue to consider the discrete decreasing minimization problem on an integral base-polyhedron treated in Part I. EOS The problem is to find a lexicographically minimal integral vector in an integral base-polyhedron, where the components of a vector are arranged in a decreasing order. EOS This study can be regarded as a discrete counter-part of the work by Fujishige (1980) on the lexicographically optimal base and the principal partition of a base-polyhedron in continuous variables. EOS The objective of Part II is two-fold. EOS The first is to offer structural views from discrete convex analysis (DCA) on the results of Part I obtained by the constructive and algorithmic approach. EOS The second objective is to pave the way of DCA approach to discrete decreasing minimization on other discrete structures such as the intersection of M-convex sets, flows, and submodular flows. EOS We derive the structural results in Part I from fundamental facts on M-convex sets and M-convex functions in DCA. EOS A direct characterization is given to the canonical partition, which was constructed by an iterative procedure in Part I. EOS This reveals the precise relationship between the canonical partition for the discrete case and the principal partition for the continuous case.	Moreover, this result entails a proximity theorem, stating that every decreasingly minimal element is contained in the small box containing the (unique) fractional decreasingly minimal element (the minimum-norm point), leading further to a continuous relaxation algorithm for finding a decreasingly minimal element of an M-convex set.

doc	Implementing a search for gravitational waves from non-precessing, spinning binary black holes EOS Searching for gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black holes (BBHs) with LIGO and Virgo involves matched-filtering data against a set of representative signal waveforms --- a template bank --- chosen to cover the full signal space of interest with as few template waveforms as possible. EOS Although the component black holes may have significant angular momenta (spin), previous searches for BBHs have filtered LIGO and Virgo data using only waveforms where both component spins are zero. EOS This leads to a loss of signal-to-noise ratio for signals where this is not the case. EOS Combining the best available template placement techniques and waveform models, we construct a template bank of GW signals from BBHs with component spins _EQN_ aligned with the orbital angular momentum, component masses _EQN_, and total mass _EQN_. EOS Using effective-one-body waveforms with spin effects, we show that less than _EQN_ of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of these signals is lost due to the discreetness of the bank, using the early advanced LIGO noise curve. EOS We use simulated advanced LIGO noise to compare the sensitivity of this bank to a non-spinning bank covering the same parameter space.	In doing so, we consider the competing effects between improved SNR and signal-based vetoes, and the increase in the rate of false alarms of the aligned-spin bank due to covering a larger parameter space.
doc	Quantifying properties of hot and dense QCD matter through systematic model-to-data comparison EOS We systematically compare an event-by-event heavy-ion collision model to data from the Large Hadron Collider.

doc	Phenomenology of non-universal gaugino masses in supersymmetric grand unified theories EOS Grand unified theories can lead to non-universal boundary conditions for the gaugino masses at the unification scale. EOS We consider the implications of such non-universal boundary conditions for the composition of the lightest neutralino as well as for the upper bound on its mass in the simplest supersymmetric grand unified theory based on the SU(5) gauge group. EOS We derive sum rules for neutralino and chargino masses in different representations of SU(5) which lead to different non-universal boundary conditions for the gaugino masses at the unification scale. EOS We also consider the phenomenological implications of the non-universal gaugino masses arising from a grand unified theory in the context of Large Hadron Collider.	In particular we investigate the detection of heavy neutral Higgs bosons _EQN_ from _EQN_, and study the possibilities of detecting the neutral Higgs bosons in cascade decays, including the decays _EQN_.
doc	Statistical properties of the one-dimensional Burridge-Knopoff model of earthquakes obeying the rate and state dependent friction law EOS Statistical properties of the one-dimensional spring-block (Burridge-Knopoff) model of earthquakes obeying the rate and state dependent friction law are studied by extensive computer simulations. EOS The quantities computed include the magnitude distribution, the rupture-length distribution, the mainshock recurrence-time distribution, the seismic time correlations before and after the mainshock, the mean slip amount, and the mean stress drop at the mainshock, etc. EOS Events of the model can be classified into two distinct categories. EOS One tends to be unilateral with its epicenter located at the rim of the rupture zone of the preceding event, while the other tends to be bilateral with enhanced "characteristic" features resembling the so-called "asperity". EOS For both types events, the distribution of the rupture length _EQN_ exhibits an exponential behavior at larger sizes, _EQN_ with a characteristic "seismic correlation length" _EQN_. EOS The mean slip as well as the mean stress drop tends to be rupture-length independent for larger events. EOS The continuum limit of the model is examined, where the model is found to exhibit pronounced characteristic features. EOS In the continuum limit, the characteristic rupture length _EQN_ is estimated to be _EQN_ 100 [km]. EOS This means that, even in a hypothetical homogenous infinite fault, events cannot be indefinitely large in the exponential sense, the upper limit being of order _EQN_ kilometers.	Implications to real seismicity are discussed.

doc	Accretion-induced variability links young stellar objects, white dwarfs, and black holes EOS The central engines of disc-accreting stellar-mass black holes appear to be scaled down versions of the supermassive black holes that power active galactic nuclei. EOS However, if the physics of accretion is universal, it should also be possible to extend this scaling to other types of accreting systems, irrespective of accretor mass, size, or type. EOS We examine new observations, obtained with Kepler/K2 and ULTRACAM, regarding accreting white dwarfs and young stellar objects.	Every object in the sample displays the same linear correlation between the brightness of the source and its amplitude of variability (rms-flux relation) and obeys the same quantitative scaling relation as stellar-mass black holes and active galactic nuclei.
doc	The NANOGrav 11-year Data Set: Pulsar-timing Constraints On The Stochastic Gravitational-wave Background EOS We search for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) in the newly released _EQN_ -year dataset from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). EOS While we find no significant evidence for a GWB, we place constraints on a GWB from a population of supermassive black-hole binaries, cosmic strings, and a primordial GWB. EOS For the first time, we find that the GWB upper limits and detection statistics are sensitive to the Solar System ephemeris (SSE) model used, and that SSE errors can mimic a GWB signal. EOS We developed an approach that bridges systematic SSE differences, producing the first PTA constraints that are robust against SSE uncertainties.	We thus place a _EQN_ upper limit on the GW strain amplitude of _EQN_ at a frequency of _EQN_ yr _EQN_ for a fiducial _EQN_ power-law spectrum, and with inter-pulsar correlations modeled.

doc	Baryon asymmetry generation in the E6CHM EOS In the E6 inspired composite Higgs model (E6CHM) the strongly interacting sector possesses an SU(6) global symmetry which is expected to be broken down to its SU(5) subgroup at the scale f > 10 TeV. EOS This breakdown results in a set of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) that includes one Standard Model (SM) singlet scalar, a SM-like Higgs doublet and an SU(3)_C triplet of scalar fields, T. EOS In the E6CHM the Z^L_ 2 symmetry, which is a discrete subgroup of the U(1)_L associated with lepton number conservation, can be used to forbid operators which lead to rapid proton decay.	The remaining baryon number violating operators are sufficiently strongly suppressed because of the large value of the scale f.

doc	Implementation of a transmon qubit using superconducting granular aluminum EOS The high kinetic inductance offered by granular aluminum (grAl) has recently been employed for linear inductors in superconducting high-impedance qubits and kinetic inductance detectors. EOS Due to its large critical current density compared to typical Josephson junctions, its resilience to external magnetic fields, and its low dissipation, grAl may also provide a robust source of non-linearity for strongly driven quantum circuits, topological superconductivity, and hybrid systems. EOS Having said that, can the grAl non-linearity be sufficient to build a qubit? EOS Here we show that a small grAl volume (_EQN_) shunted by a thin film aluminum capacitor results in a microwave oscillator with anharmonicity _EQN_ two orders of magnitude larger than its spectral linewidth _EQN_, effectively forming a transmon qubit. EOS With increasing drive power, we observe several multi-photon transitions starting from the ground state, from which we extract _EQN_. EOS Resonance fluorescence measurements of the _EQN_ transition yield an intrinsic qubit linewidth _EQN_, corresponding to a lifetime of _EQN_.	This linewidth remains below _EQN_ for in-plane magnetic fields up to _EQN_.
doc	Structure of quantum vortex tangle in He-4 counterflow turbulence EOS The main goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive characterization of well developed vortex tangles in a turbulent counterflow in quantum fluids (with a laminar normal fluid component).

In addition to a detailed analysis of traditional characteristics such as vortex line density, anisotropic and curvature parameters of the vortex tangle, we stress other dynamical and statistical characteristics which are either much less studied or even unstudied.
doc	Inventions on reducing number of keys on a Computer Keyboard -- A TRIZ based analysis EOS A computer keyboard consists of several sections and each section consists of several numbers of keys. EOS The text entry section contains the standard character keys, navigation section contains cursor movement and page control keys, numeric keypad contains numeric keys and function keys section contain function keys and special keys. EOS Although the increased number of keys helps smooth interaction with a computer there are situations where it is necessary to reduce the number of keys. EOS The need for reducing number of keys in a keyboard creates a technical contradiction. EOS Generally more number of keys can support more number of functions and less number of keys can support less number of functions. EOS We need more number of functions (all the functions available in a full size keyboard), but we want only less number of keys (Contradiction). EOS This contradiction has been solved by using multi-stroke mechanism.	There may be different purposes to reduce the number of keys in a keyboard.

doc	Decaying hadrons within constituent-quark models EOS Within conventional constituent-quark models hadrons come out as stable bound states of the valence (anti)quarks. EOS Thereby the resonance character of hadronic excitations is completely ignored. EOS A more realistic description of hadron spectra can be achieved by including explicit mesonic degrees of freedom, which couple directly to the constituent quarks. EOS We will present a coupled-channel formalism that describes such hybrid systems in a relativistically invariant way and allows for the decay of excited hadrons. EOS The formalism is based on the point-form of relativistic quantum mechanics. EOS If the confining forces between the (anti)quarks are described by instantaneous interactions it can be formally shown that the mass-eigenvalue problem for a system that consists of dynamical (anti)quarks and mesons reduces to a hadronic eigenvalue problem in which the eigenstates of the pure confinement problem (bare hadrons) are coupled via meson loops. EOS The only point where the quark substructure enters are form factors at the meson-(bare) hadron vertices. EOS The physical picture that emerges resembles the kind of hadronic resonance model that has been developed by Sato and Lee and is now heavily used at the Excited Baryon Analysis Center (EBAC) to fix _EQN_ properties. EOS Our approach, however, is in a certain sense inverse to the one of Sato and Lee. EOS Whereas they want to undress physical resonances to end up with bare quantities, we rather want to dress the bound-states resulting from a pure constituent quark model to end up with quantities that can be directly compared with experiment.	The way how our approach works will be exemplified by means of a simple quark-antiquark-meson system.
doc	Scalable Quantum Computing with "Enhancement" Quantum Dots EOS We propose a novel scheme of solid state realization of a quantum computer based on single spin "enhancement mode" quantum dots as building blocks. EOS In the enhancement quantum dots, just one electron can be brought into initially empty dot, in contrast to depletion mode dots based on expelling of electrons from multi-electron dots by gates. EOS The quantum computer architectures based on depletion dots are confronted by several challenges making scalability difficult. EOS These challenges can be successfully met by the approach based on ehnancement mode, capable of producing square array of dots with versatile functionalities.	These functionalities allow transportation of qubits, including teleportation, and error correction based on straightforward one- and two-qubit operations.

EOS All the four CSCs, including the brightest in this galaxy, are found to have ages between 5 to 6 Myr, with one of them showing Wolf-Rayet spectral features. EOS The photometric masses of these clusters, calculated using their spectroscopically-derived ages, lie between 3000 and 18000 Msun.	The observed clusters are among the brightest objects, and hence the most massive, in the entire disk of M81.
doc	Discovery of a Magnetic White Dwarf/Probable Brown Dwarf Short-Period Binary EOS The magnetic white dwarf SDSS J121209.31+013627.7 exhibits a weak, narrow Halpha emission line whose radial velocity and strength are modulated on a period of ~90 minutes. EOS Though indicative of irradiation on a nearby companion, no cool continuum component is evident in the optical spectrum, and IR photometry limits the absolute magnitude of the companion to M_J > 13.37. EOS This is equivalent to an isolated L5 dwarf, with T_eff < 1700 K. EOS Consideration of possible evolutionary histories suggests that, until ~0.6 Gyr ago, the brown dwarf orbited a ~1.5 M_sun main seqeunce star with P ~ 1 yr, a ~ 1 AU, thus resembling many of the gaseous superplanets being found in extrasolar planet searches.	Common envelope evolution when the massive star left the main sequence reduced the period to only a few hours, and ensuing angular momentum loss has further degraded the orbit.
doc	Can information be spread as a virus? Viral Marketing as epidemiological model EOS In epidemiology, an epidemic is defined as the spread of an infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time. EOS In the marketing context, a message is viral when it is broadly sent and received by the target market through person-to-person transmission. EOS This specific marketing communication strategy is commonly referred as viral marketing.	Due to this similarity between an epidemic and the viral marketing process and because the understanding of the critical factors to this communications strategy effectiveness remain largely unknown, the mathematical models in epidemiology are presented in this marketing specific field.
doc	The Complex Hierarchical Topology of EEG Functional Connectivity EOS Understanding the complex hierarchical topology of functional brain networks is a key aspect of functional connectivity research. EOS Such topics are obscured by the widespread use of sparse binary network models which are fundamentally different to the complete weighted networks derived from functional connectivity. EOS We introduce two techniques to probe the hierarchical complexity of topologies. EOS Firstly, a new metric to measure hierarchical complexity; EOS secondly, a Weighted Complex Hierarchy (WCH) model. EOS To thoroughly evaluate our techniques, we generalise sparse binary network archetypes to weighted forms and explore the main topological features of brain networks- integration, regularity and modularity- using curves over density. EOS By controlling the parameters of our model, the highest complexity is found to arise between a random topology and a strict 'class-based' topology. EOS Further, the model has equivalent complexity to EEG phase-lag networks at peak performance. EOS Hierarchical complexity attains greater magnitude and range of differences between different networks than the previous commonly used complexity metric and our WCH model offers a much broader range of network topology than the standard scale-free and small-world models at a full range of densities.	Our metric and model provide a rigorous characterisation of hierarchical complexity.

EOS Calculations are performed for the B1, B2, B3, B4, B8_1 and h-MgO polymorphs of MgO to compute lattice constants and bulk moduli. EOS The isothermal enthalpy calculations predict that B4 to B8_1, h-MgO to B8_1, B3 to B2, B4 to B2 and h-MgO to B2 transitions take place at 2, 9, 37, 42 and 64 GPa respectively. EOS The high pressure transitions B8_1 to B2 and B1 to B2 are found to occur at 340 and 410 GPa respectively. EOS The pressure dependent changes are observed largely in the valence electrons Compton profiles whereas core profiles are almost independent of the pressure in all MgO polymorphs.	Increase in pressure results in broadening of the valence Compton profiles.

doc	On the Classical Hardness of Spoofing Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmarking EOS Recently, Google announced the first demonstration of quantum computational supremacy with a programmable superconducting processor. EOS Their demonstration is based on collecting samples from the output distribution of a noisy random quantum circuit, then applying a statistical test to those samples called Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmarking (Linear XEB). EOS This raises a theoretical question: how hard is it for a classical computer to spoof the results of the Linear XEB test? EOS In this short note, we adapt an analysis of Aaronson and Chen  to prove a conditional hardness result for Linear XEB spoofing.	Specifically, we show that the problem is classically hard, assuming that there is no efficient classical algorithm that, given a random n-qubit quantum circuit C, estimates the probability of C outputting a specific output string, say 0^n, with variance even slightly better than that of the trivial estimator that always estimates 1/2^n.
doc	Giant Planet Occurrence in the Stellar Mass-Metallicity Plane EOS Correlations between stellar properties and the occurrence rate of exoplanets can be used to inform the target selection of future planet search efforts and provide valuable clues about the planet formation process. EOS We analyze a sample of 1194 stars drawn from the California Planet Survey targets to determine the empirical functional form describing the likelihood of a star harboring a giant planet as a function of its mass and metallicity. EOS Our stellar sample ranges from M dwarfs with masses as low as 0.2 Msun to intermediate-mass subgiants with masses as high as 1.9 Msun. EOS In agreement with previous studies, our sample exhibits a planet-metallicity correlation at all stellar masses; EOS the fraction of stars that harbor giant planets scales as f \propto 10^ 1.2 [Fe/H].	We can rule out a flat metallicity relationship among our evolved stars (at 98% confidence), which argues that the high metallicities of stars with planets are not likely due to convective envelope "pollution." Our data also rule out a constant planet occurrence rate for [Fe/H]< 0, indicating that giant planets continue to become rarer at sub-Solar metallicities.

EOS We first recall the classical problem of integration in the context, and present the construction for (non-graded) differential Lie algebras. EOS Then, we define the category of differential graded Lie groups and study its properties. EOS We show how to associate a differential graded Lie algebra to every differential graded Lie group and vice-versa. EOS For the DGLA _EQN_ DGLG direction, the main ``tools'' are graded Hopf algebras and Harish-Chandra pairs (HCP) -- we define the category of graded and differential graded HCPs and explain how those are related to the desired construction.	We describe some near at hand examples and mention possible generalizations.

doc	Boundary actions for affine buildings and higher rank Cuntz-Krieger algebras EOS Let _EQN_ be a group of type rotating automorphisms of an affine building _EQN_ of type _EQN_. EOS If _EQN_ acts freely on the vertices of _EQN_ with finitely many orbits, and if _EQN_ is the (maximal) boundary of _EQN_, then _EQN_ is a p.i.s.u.n. EOS _EQN_ -algebra. EOS This algebra has a structure theory analogous to that of a simple Cuntz-Krieger algebra and is the motivation for a theory of higher rank Cuntz-Krieger algebras, which has been developed by T. EOS Steger and G. EOS Robertson. EOS The K-theory of these algebras can be computed explicitly in the rank two case.	For the rank two examples of the form _EQN_ which arise from boundary actions on _EQN_ buildings, the two K-groups coincide.

doc	The nature of intrinsic fluctuations in cosmic diffuse radiation EOS The spatial and temporal noise properties of diffuse radiation is investigated in the context of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), although generic formulae that enable application to any other forms of incoherent light of a prescribed energy spectrum are also provided. EOS It is shown that the variance of fluctuations in the density and flux consists of two parts. EOS First is a term from the spontaneous emission coefficient which is the contribution from a random gas of classical particles representing the corpuscular (photon) nature of light. EOS Second is a term from the stimulated emission coefficient which leads to a `wave noise', or more precisely the noise arising from the superposition of many plane waves of arbitrary phase - the normal modes of the radiation. EOS The origin of this second term has never been elucidated before. EOS We discussed one application. EOS In the spatially homogeneous post-inflationary epochs when the universe was reheated to GUT temperatures, the thermal CMB density fluctuations on the horizon scale is of order the WMAP measured value of 10 _EQN_.	Beyond (larger than) the horizon, the power spectrum of perturbations could moreover assume the observed form of _EQN_ if thermal diffusion to equilibrium does not merely involve classical particles, but also non-localized wave components.

doc	Relative Entropy Regularised TDLAS Tomography for Robust Temperature Imaging EOS Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) tomography has been widely used for in situ combustion diagnostics, yielding images of both species concentration and temperature. EOS The temperature image is generally obtained from the reconstructed absorbance distributions for two spectral transitions, i.e. EOS two-line thermometry.	However, the inherently ill-posed nature of tomographic data inversion leads to noise in each of the reconstructed absorbance distributions.
doc	Finite-size scaling in a 2D disordered electron gas with spectral nodes EOS We study the DC conductivity of a weakly disordered 2D electron gas with two bands and spectral nodes, employing the field theoretical version of the Kubo--Greenwood conductivity formula. EOS Disorder scattering is treated within the standard perturbation theory by summing up ladder and maximally crossed diagrams. EOS The emergent gapless (diffusion) modes determine the behavior of the conductivity on large scales.	We find a finite conductivity with an intermediate logarithmic finite-size scaling towards smaller conductivities but do not obtain the logarithmically divergence of the weak-localization approach.

In this paper, we investigate an inverse problem where, given only the availability of output data, we nonparametrically calibrate the input models and other related performance measures of interest.
doc	Pairs of chiral quarks on the lattice from staggered fermions EOS A new formulation of chiral fermions on the lattice is presented. EOS It is a version of overlap fermions, but built from the computationally efficient staggered fermions rather than the previously used Wilson fermions. EOS The construction reduces the four quark flavors described by the staggered fermion to two quark flavors; EOS this pair can be taken as the up and down quarks in Lattice QCD. EOS The exact flavored chiral symmetry of the staggered fermion gets converted into an unflavored Ginsparg-Wilson chiral symmetry of the new overlap fermion, which also has pairs of exact chiral zero-modes satisfying the Index Theorem. EOS Stability under radiative corrections is checked.	A domain wall formulation giving a truncation of this overlap construction is also outlined.

doc	Modelling textile structures using bicontinuous surfaces EOS We present a method for modelling textile structures, such as weft knits, on families of bicontinuous surfaces. EOS By developing a tangible interpretation of mathematical theory, we combine perspectives of art, design, engineering, and science to understand how the architecture of the knit relates to its physical and mathematical properties. EOS While modelling and design tools have become ubiquitous in many industries, there is still a significant lack of predictive advanced manufacturing techniques available for the design and manufacture of textiles. EOS We describe a mathematical structure as a system for dynamic modelling of textiles in the form of a physical prototype which may be used to inform and predict relevant textile parameters prior to fabrication.	This includes dimensional changes due to yarn relaxation, which would streamline production of knit textiles for industry, makers and textile artists.
doc	Switching based Spin Transfer Torque Oscillator with zero-bias field and large tuning-ratio EOS We propose a novel concept of obtaining oscillations with frequencies in very-high frequency (VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands. EOS A traditional spin torque nano-oscillator (STNO) consists of at least one pinned layer (PL) and one free layer (FL) which precesses in a fixed orbit, defined by a precession angle, which results in magneto-resistance (MR) oscillations. EOS In STNO, with aligned or even orthogonal easy-axis of the magnetic layers and with or without external bias magnetic field, it is not possible to attain full MR swing. EOS The constringed MR swing jeopardizes the extracted output power. EOS Furthermore, the orbit is strongly disturbed by the thermal fluctuations resulting in strong magnetic noise. EOS In stark contrast to the operation principle of a STNO, we theoretically demonstrate, with the practical parameters from the experiments, that with a unidirectional current in a dual asymmetric free-layers (with no pinned layer) based perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ), both of the free layers can attain a complete and out-of-phase self-sustained switching without the aid of any external magnetic field. EOS This design facilitates a switching based spin torque oscillator (SW-STO) with a full MR swing, and hence a larger output power, for stable and more thermally robust free-running oscillations.	Furthermore, the integration with the n-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS) field-effect transistors at 130, 65 and 14 nm node is appraised to expound its effect on the oscillator performance, controllability with DC bias and the design constraints, to demonstrate the viability of the design as a dynamically controllable oscillator for practical on-chip implementation.

doc	Splitting of nonlinear-Schr\"odinger breathers by linear and nonlinear localized potentials EOS We consider evolution of one-dimensional nonlinear-Schr\"odinger (NLS) two-soliton complexes (breathers) with narrow repulsive or attractive potentials (barrier or well, respectively). EOS By means of systematic simulations, we demonstrate that the breather may either split into constituent fundamental solitons (fragments) moving in opposite directions, or bounce as a whole from the barrier.	A critical initial position of the breather, which separates these scenarios, is predicted by an analytical approximation.
doc	Total perfect codes in zero-divisor graphs EOS Let R be a commutative ring with unity not equal to zero and let G = (V, E) be a simple, undirected graph. EOS A total perfect code denoted by C(G), in G is a subset C(G) of V (G) such that cardinality of the set N (v) \cap C(G) is 1, for all v \in V (G), where N (v) denotes the neighbourhood of a vertex v in G. EOS J. EOS Kratcohvil in (1986), proved the non existence of non trivial perfect codes over complete bipartite graphs.	In this research article, we present another family of graphs known as zero-divisor graphs which does not admit perfect codes.
doc	The fundamental obscurity in quantum mechanics. Could the problem be considered universal? EOS The contemporary controversy about the fundamental obscurity in quantum mechanics keeps on the old one about the aim of science, which was between the founders of the quantum theory. EOS The orthodox quantum mechanics could be created only at the cost of renunciation of reality as the aim of natural science. EOS The description only of phenomena, i.e. EOS results of observation, should not be universal if no one believes that these phenomena are manifestation of a unique reality. EOS Such belief concerning quantum mechanics is quite unacceptable because of irremediably conflict with special relativity. EOS Nevertheless the quantum mechanics was developed and apprehended by most physicists as a universal theory of a quantum world. EOS This fundamental discrepancy between the essence of the orthodox quantum mechanics and its history of development and studying has resulted both to an illusion about the aim of its description among most physicists and to the consideration of its fundamental obscurity as a universal problem among experts in quantum foundation. EOS The aim of this paper is to show that quantum phenomena can not be described universally.	It is indicated that rather the Schrodinger's than Born's interpretation of the wave function is valid for description of many quantum phenomena.
doc	Derivation of OTFS Modulation from First Principles EOS Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has been recently proposed to be robust to channel induced Doppler shift in high mobility wireless communication systems. EOS However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the prior works on OTFS have derived it from first principles. EOS In this paper, using the ZAK representation of time-domain (TD) signals, we rigorously derive an orthonormal basis of approximately time and bandwidth limited signals which are also localized in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain.	We then consider DD domain modulation based on this orthonormal basis, and derive OTFS modulation.
doc	Graph Pruning for Model Compression EOS Previous AutoML pruning works utilized individual layer features to automatically prune filters. EOS We analyze the correlation for two layers from different blocks which have a short-cut structure. EOS It is found that, in one block, the deeper layer has many redundant filters which can be represented by filters in the former layer so that it is necessary to take information from other layers into consideration in pruning.	In this paper, a graph pruning approach is proposed, which views any deep model as a topology graph.
doc	Anomaly Detection in Large Scale Networks with Latent Space Models EOS We develop a real-time anomaly detection algorithm for directed activity on large, sparse networks. EOS We model the propensity for future activity using a dynamic logistic model with interaction terms for sender- and receiver-specific latent factors in addition to sender- and receiver-specific popularity scores; EOS deviations from this underlying model constitute potential anomalies.	Latent nodal attributes are estimated via a variational Bayesian approach and may change over time, representing natural shifts in network activity.
doc	Super-resolution of clinical CT volumes with modified CycleGAN using micro CT volumes EOS This paper presents a super-resolution (SR) method with unpaired training dataset of clinical CT and micro CT volumes. EOS For obtaining very detailed information such as cancer invasion from pre-operative clinical CT volumes of lung cancer patients, SR of clinical CT volumes to _EQN_ CT level is desired.	While most SR methods require paired low- and high- resolution images for training, it is infeasible to obtain paired clinical CT and \mu CT volumes.
doc	Simple iterative method for generating targeted universal adversarial perturbations EOS Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. EOS In particular, a single perturbation known as the universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) can foil most classification tasks conducted by DNNs.	Thus, different methods for generating UAPs are required to fully evaluate the vulnerability of DNNs.
doc	Planetary influence on the young Sun's evolution: the solar neutrino probe EOS Recent observations of solar twin stars with planetary systems like the Sun, have uncovered that these present a peculiar surface chemical composition. EOS This is believed to be related to the formation of earth-like planets. EOS This suggests that twin stars have a radiative interior that is richer in heavy elements than their envelopes. EOS Moreover, the current standard solar model does not fully agree with the helioseismology data and solar neutrino flux measurements. EOS In this work, we find that this agreement can improve if the Sun has mass loss during the pre-main sequence, as was previously shown by other groups. EOS Despite this better agreement, the internal composition of the Sun is still uncertain, especially for elements heavier than helium. EOS With the goal of inferring the chemical abundance of the solar interior, we tested several chemical compositions. EOS We found that heavy element abundances influence the sound speed and solar neutrinos equally. EOS Nevertheless, the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO;	13N, 15O and 17F) neutrino fluxes are the most affected;
doc	Feedforward semantic segmentation with zoom-out features EOS We introduce a purely feed-forward architecture for semantic segmentation. EOS We map small image elements (superpixels) to rich feature representations extracted from a sequence of nested regions of increasing extent. EOS These regions are obtained by "zooming out" from the superpixel all the way to scene-level resolution.	This approach exploits statistical structure in the image and in the label space without setting up explicit structured prediction mechanisms, and thus avoids complex and expensive inference.
doc	The gravitational energy-momentum tensor and the gravitational pressure EOS In the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity it is possible to establish the energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field. EOS This tensor has the following essential features: (1) it is identified directly in Einstein's field equations; EOS (2) it is conserved and traceless;	(3) it yields expressions for the energy and momentum of the gravitational field;
doc	On Axion Reheating in the String Landscape EOS We demonstrate that asymmetric reheating arises in a large ensemble of string compactifications with many axions and gauged dark sectors. EOS This phenomenon may help avoid numerous cosmological problems that may arise if the sectors were reheated democratically.	Distributions of couplings are presented for two classes of axion reheatons, both of which exhibit very small couplings to most of the gauge sectors.
doc	On Weak Elimination of Hyperimaginaries and its Consequences EOS We analyze the notion of weak elimination of hyperimaginaries (WEHI) in simple theories. EOS A key observation in the analysis is a characterization of WEHI in terms of forking dependence -- a condition we dub dependence-witnessed-by-imaginaries (DWIP). EOS Generalizing results of  and, we show that in a simple theory with WEHI, forking and thorn-forking coincide. EOS We also show that, conversely, the equivalence of independence and thorn-independence is (almost) sufficient for WEHI. EOS Thus, the WEHI and the statement independence = thorn-independence are morally equivalent.	As a further application of our technology, we demonstrate stable forking for 1-based theories of finite SU-rank that have WEHI.

doc	Entanglement entropies in the ground states of helium-like atoms EOS We examine the entanglement in the ground states of helium and helium-like ions using an original Hylleraas expansion. EOS The von Neumann and linear entropies of the reduced density matrix are accurately computed by performing the Schmidt decomposition of the S singlet spatial wavefunctions.	The results presented are more accurate than currently available in published literature.
doc	Total Roto-Translational Variation EOS We consider curvature depending variational models for image regularization, such as Euler's elastica. EOS These models are known to provide strong priors for the continuity of edges and hence have important applications in shape-and image processing. EOS We consider a lifted convex representation of these models in the roto-translation space: In this space, curvature depending variational energies are represented by means of a convex functional defined on divergence free vector fields. EOS The line energies are then easily extended to any scalar function. EOS It yields a natural generalization of the total variation to the roto-translation space. EOS As our main result, we show that the proposed convex representation is tight for characteristic functions of smooth shapes. EOS We also discuss cases where this representation fails. EOS For numerical solution, we propose a staggered grid discretization based on an averaged Raviart-Thomas finite elements approximation. EOS This discretization is consistent, up to minor details, with the underlying continuous model.	The resulting non-smooth convex optimization problem is solved using a first-order primal-dual algorithm.
doc	Dirichlet uncertainty wrappers for actionable algorithm accuracy accountability and auditability EOS Nowadays, the use of machine learning models is becoming a utility in many applications. EOS Companies deliver pre-trained models encapsulated as application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers combine with third party components and their own models and data to create complex data products to solve specific problems. EOS The complexity of such products and the lack of control and knowledge of the internals of each component used cause unavoidable effects, such as lack of transparency, difficulty in auditability, and emergence of potential uncontrolled risks. EOS They are effectively black-boxes. EOS Accountability of such solutions is a challenge for the auditors and the machine learning community. EOS In this work, we propose a wrapper that given a black-box model enriches its output prediction with a measure of uncertainty. EOS By using this wrapper, we make the black-box auditable for the accuracy risk (risk derived from low quality or uncertain decisions) and at the same time we provide an actionable mechanism to mitigate that risk in the form of decision rejection; EOS we can choose not to issue a prediction when the risk or uncertainty in that decision is significant. EOS Based on the resulting uncertainty measure, we advocate for a rejection system that selects the more confident predictions, discarding those more uncertain, leading to an improvement in the trustability of the resulting system. EOS We showcase the proposed technique and methodology in a practical scenario where a simulated sentiment analysis API based on natural language processing is applied to different domains.	Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the uncertainty computed by the wrapper and its high correlation to bad quality predictions and misclassifications.
doc	Representations of the Exceptional Lie superalgebra E(3,6): I. Degeneracy conditions EOS Recently one of the authors obtained a classification of simple infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebras of vector fields which extends the well-known classification of E. EOS Cartan in the Lie algebra case. EOS The list consists of many series defined by simple equations, and of several exceptional superalgebras, among them E(3,6). EOS In the article we study irreducible representations of the exceptional Lie superalgebra E(3,6).	This superalgebra has s\ell(3)\times s\ell(2)\times g\ell(1) as the zero degree component of its consistent \ZZ-grading which leads us to believe that its representation theory has potential for physical applications.
doc	Simple proofs of nowhere-differentiability for Weierstrass's function and cases of slow growth EOS Using a few basics from integration theory, a short proof of nowhere-differentiability of Weierstrass functions is given.	Restated in terms of the Fourier transformation, the method consists in principle of a second microlocalisation, which is used to derive two general results on existence of nowhere differentiable functions.
doc	Gate-recessed E-mode p-channel HFET with high on-current based on GaN/AlN 2D hole gas EOS High-performance p-channel transistors are crucial to implementing efficient complementary circuits in wide-bandgap electronics, but progress on such devices has lagged far behind their powerful electron-based counterparts due to the inherent challenges of manipulating holes in wide-gap semiconductors.	Building on recent advances in materials growth, this work sets simultaneous records in both on-current (10 mA/mm) and on-off modulation (four orders) for the GaN/AlN wide-bandgap p-FET structure.
doc	Covering selfish machines EOS We consider the machine covering problem for selfish related machines. EOS For a constant number of machines, m, we show a monotone polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) with running time that is linear in the number of jobs. EOS It uses a new technique for reducing the number of jobs while remaining close to the optimal solution. EOS We also present an FPTAS for the classical machine covering problem (the previous best result was a PTAS) and use this to give a monotone FPTAS. EOS Additionally, we give a monotone approximation algorithm with approximation ratio \min(m,(2+\eps)s_1/s_m) where \eps>0 can be chosen arbitrarily small and s_i is the (real) speed of machine i. EOS Finally we give improved results for two machines.	Our paper presents the first results for this problem in the context of selfish machines.
doc	The Black Hole-Bulge Relationship in Luminous Broad-Line Active Galactic Nuclei and Host Galaxies EOS We have measured the stellar velocity dispersions (\sigma_*) and estimated the central black hole (BH) masses for over 900 broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. EOS The sample includes objects which have redshifts up to z=0.452, high quality spectra, and host galaxy spectra dominated by an early-type (bulge) component. EOS The AGN and host galaxy spectral components were decomposed using an eigenspectrum technique. EOS The BH masses (M_BH) were estimated from the AGN broad-line widths, and the velocity dispersions were measured from the stellar absorption spectra of the host galaxies. EOS The range of black hole masses covered by the sample is approximately 10^6 < M_BH < 10^9 M_Sun. EOS The host galaxy luminosity-velocity dispersion relationship follows the well-known Faber-Jackson relation for early-type galaxies, with a power-law slope 4.33+-0.21.	The estimated BH masses are correlated with both the host luminosities (L_ H) and the stellar velocity dispersions (\sigma_*), similar to the relationships found for low-redshift, bulge-dominated galaxies.

doc	Anchored in a Data Storm: How Anchoring Bias Can Affect User Strategy, Confidence, and Decisions in Visual Analytics EOS Cognitive biases have been shown to lead to faulty decision-making. EOS Recent research has demonstrated that the effect of cognitive biases, anchoring bias in particular, transfers to information visualization and visual analytics. EOS However, it is still unclear how users of visual interfaces can be anchored and the impact of anchoring on user performance and decision-making process. EOS To investigate, we performed two rounds of between-subjects, in-laboratory experiments with 94 participants to analyze the effect of visual anchors and strategy cues in decision-making with a visual analytic system that employs coordinated multiple view design. EOS The decision-making task is identifying misinformation from Twitter news accounts.	Participants were randomly assigned one of three treatment groups (including control) in which participant training processes were modified.

doc	A review of metasurfaces: physics and applications EOS Metamaterials are composed of periodic subwavelength metal/dielectric structures that resonantly couple to the electric and/or magnetic components of the incident electromagnetic fields, exhibiting properties that are not found in nature. EOS Planar metamaterials with subwavelength thickness, or metasurfaces, consisting of single-layer or few-layer stacks of planar structures, can be readily fabricated using lithography and nanoprinting methods, and the ultrathin thickness in the wave propagation direction can greatly suppress the undesirable losses. EOS Metasurfaces enable a spatially varying optical response, mold optical wavefronts into shapes that can be designed at will, and facilitate the integration of functional materials to accomplish active control and greatly enhanced nonlinear response. EOS This paper reviews recent progress in the physics of metasurfaces operating at wavelengths ranging from microwave to visible. EOS We provide an overview of key metasurface concepts such as anomalous reflection and refraction, and introduce metasurfaces based on the Pancharatnam-Berry phase and Huygens' metasurfaces, as well as their use in wavefront shaping and beam forming applications, followed by a discussion of polarization conversion in few-layer metasurfaces and their related properties. EOS An overview of dielectric metasurfaces reveals their ability to realize unique functionalities coupled with Mie resonances and their low ohmic losses. EOS We also describe metasurfaces for wave guidance and radiation control, as well as active and nonlinear metasurfaces.	Finally, we conclude by providing our opinions of opportunities and challenges in this rapidly developing research field.
doc	Possible Precise Neutrino Unitarity? EOS The exploration of the Standard Model (SM) leptonic mixing has been led by the study of the neutrino (\nu) oscillations phenomenon, whose discovery was acknowledged by the 2015 Nobel prize in physics. EOS Half a century of experimental and theoretical effort has established and demonstrated consistency with the 3 \nu model and with the so far SM three family evidence. EOS While no direct significant manifestation for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) has been found, the SM is known not to suffice to explain all today's observed phenomenology. EOS In the forthcoming decade, most oscillation parameters are expected to yield sub-percent precision.	Such a knowledge opens the possibility to experimentally test for BSM manifestation(s) via the direct and competitive exploration of the PMNS matrix unitarity for the first time.

doc	HOGWILD!-Gibbs can be PanAccurate EOS Asynchronous Gibbs sampling has been recently shown to be fast-mixing and an accurate method for estimating probabilities of events on a small number of variables of a graphical model satisfying Dobrushin's condition~ REF. EOS We investigate whether it can be used to accurately estimate expectations of functions of all the variables of the model. EOS Under the same condition, we show that the synchronous (sequential) and asynchronous Gibbs samplers can be coupled so that the expected Hamming distance between their (multivariate) samples remains bounded by _EQN_ where _EQN_ is the number of variables in the graphical model, and _EQN_ is a measure of the asynchronicity. EOS A similar bound holds for any constant power of the Hamming distance. EOS Hence, the expectation of any function that is Lipschitz with respect to a power of the Hamming distance, can be estimated with a bias that grows logarithmically in _EQN_.	Going beyond Lipschitz functions, we consider the bias arising from asynchronicity in estimating the expectation of polynomial functions of all variables in the model.
doc	Restoration of the Derivative Discontinuity in Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory: An Efficient Scheme for Energy Gap Correction EOS From the perspective of perturbation theory, we propose a systematic procedure for the evaluation of the derivative discontinuity (DD) of the exchange-correlation energy functional in Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT), wherein the exact DD can in principle be obtained by summing up all the perturbation corrections to infinite order.	Truncation of the perturbation series at low order yields an efficient scheme for obtaining the approximate DD.

EOS We have also calculated the Bethe logarithms for the helium-like ions of Li, Be, O and S for all three states to study the 1/Z behavior of the results.	The Bethe logarithm of H minus was also calculated with somewhat less accuracy.
doc	Collective allocation of science funding: from funding agencies to scientific agency EOS Public agencies like the U.S. EOS National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) award tens of billions of dollars in annual science funding. EOS How can this money be distributed as efficiently as possible to best promote scientific innovation and productivity? EOS The present system relies primarily on peer review of project proposals. EOS In 2010 alone, NSF convened more than 15,000 scientists to review 55,542 proposals. EOS Although considered the scientific gold standard, peer review requires significant overhead costs, and may be subject to biases, inconsistencies, and oversights. EOS We investigate a class of funding models in which all participants receive an equal portion of yearly funding, but are then required to anonymously donate a fraction of their funding to peers. EOS The funding thus flows from one participant to the next, each acting as if he or she were a funding agency themselves. EOS Here we show through a simulation conducted over large-scale citation data (37M articles, 770M citations) that such a distributed system for science may yield funding patterns similar to existing NIH and NSF distributions, but may do so at much lower overhead while exhibiting a range of other desirable features.	Self-correcting mechanisms in scientific peer evaluation can yield an efficient and fair distribution of funding.

doc	Chemistry of atmospheres formed during accretion of the Earth and other terrestrial planets EOS We used chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetic calculations to model chemistry of the volatiles released by heating different types of carbonaceous, ordinary and enstatite chondritic material as a function of temperature and pressure. EOS Our results predict the composition of atmospheres formed by outgassing during accretion of the Earth and other terrestrial planets. EOS Outgassing of CI and CM carbonaceous chondritic material produces H2O-rich (steam) atmospheres in agreement with the results of impact experiments. EOS However, outgassing of other types of chondritic material produces atmospheres dominated by other gases. EOS Outgassing of ordinary (H, L, LL) and high iron enstatite (EH) chondritic material yields H2-rich atmospheres with CO and H2O being the second and third most abundant gases. EOS Outgassing of low iron enstatite (EL) chondritic material gives a CO-rich atmosphere with H2, CO2, and H2O being the next most abundant gases. EOS Outgassing of CV carbonaceous chondritic material gives a CO2-rich atmosphere with H2O being the second most abundant gas.	Our results predict that the atmospheres formed during accretion of the Earth and Mars were probably H2-rich unless the accreted material was dominantly CI and CM carbonaceous chondritic material.
doc	Maximally additively reducible subsets of the integers EOS Let _EQN_ be two finite sets of natural numbers. EOS We say that _EQN_ is an additive divisor for _EQN_ if there exists some _EQN_ with _EQN_. EOS We prove that among those subsets of _EQN_ which have _EQN_ as an element, the full interval _EQN_ has the most divisors.	To generalize to sets which do not have _EQN_ as an element, we prove a correspondence between additive divisors and lunar multiplication, introduced by Appelgate, LeBrun and Sloane (2011) in their study of a kind of min/max arithmetic.

EOS In particular, the low-energy (_EQN_ keV) ion-sputtering induced transient enhanced intermixing has been studied by MD simulations. EOS Ab initio density functional calculations have been used to check and reparametrize the employed heteronuclear interatomic potential.	We find a robust intermixing in Pt/Ti driven by nanoscale mass-anisotropy.

EOS Self-diffusion takes place preferentially in the direction normal to the smectic layers, and occurs by quasi-quantized steps of one rod length.	The diffusion rate corresponds with the rate calculated from the diffusion in the nematic state with a lamellar periodic ordering potential that is obtained experimentally.
doc	Correlations induced by fractional statistics in _EQN_ quantum spin liquids EOS Realistic Hamiltonians for quantum spin liquids often exhibit a large separation of energy scales between their elementary excitations. EOS At low but experimentally relevant temperatures, some excitations are in a low-temperature regime where they are sparse and hop coherently across the lattice, while others are thermally excited and behave as a dense, stochastic ensemble. EOS We study the interplay of these quasiparticles in the case where it is driven solely by their nontrivial mutual statistics rather than by direct interaction energy terms. EOS Specifically, we consider toy models for _EQN_ quantum spin liquids, where the two species of excitation (dubbed spinons and visons) are mutual semions. EOS Our results show an intriguing feedback mechanism, akin to the Nagaoka effect, whereby the spinons become localised on patches of expelled visons whose typical diameter increases as temperature is reduced. EOS We comment on the direct consequences of this phenomenon on the average density of excitations, as well as on transport and thermodynamic properties of the system.	In particular, the combination of localisation and fractionalisation of the spinons leads to hysteretic behaviour in the density of excitations when performing closed temperature cycles.
doc	Spectra of Discrete Schr\"odinger Operators with Primitive Invertible Substitution Potentials EOS We study the spectral properties of discrete Schr\"odinger operators with potentials given by primitive invertible substitution sequences (or by Sturmian sequences whose rotation angle has an eventually periodic continued fraction expansion, a strictly larger class than primitive invertible substitution sequences).	It is known that operators from this family have spectra which are Cantor sets of zero Lebesgue measure.
doc	Solvers and precondtioners based on Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi algorithms for non-symmetric stochastic Galerkin system of equations EOS In this work, solvers and preconditioners based on Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi algorithms are explored for stochastic Galerkin discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) with random input data.	Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi algorithms are formulated such that the existing software is leveraged in the computational effort.
doc	Non-universal, Non-anomalous U(1)' in a Model with Anomaly Mediated SUSY Breaking EOS We construct a Minimum Supersymmetry Standard Model expanded by a non-anomalous family (NAF) U(1)'_ NAF gauge symmetry. EOS All gauge anomalies are cancelled with no additional exotics other than the three right-handed neutrinos. EOS The FI D-terms associated with the U(1)'_ NAF symmetry lead to additional positive contributions to slepton squared masses. EOS In a RG invariant way, this thus solves the tachyonic slepton mass problem in Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking.	In addition, the U(1)'_ NAF symmetry naturally gives rise to the fermion mass hierarchy and mixing angles, and determines the mass spectrum of the sparticles.
doc	Biased Tracers in Redshift Space in the EFTofLSS with exact time dependence EOS We study the effect of the Einstein de-Sitter (EdS) approximation on the one-loop power spectrum of galaxies in redshift space in the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure. EOS The dark matter density perturbations and velocity divergence are treated with exact time dependence. EOS Splitting the density perturbation into its different temporal evolutions naturally gives rise to an irreducible basis of biases. EOS While, as in the EdS approximation, at each time this basis spans a seven-dimensional space, this space is a slightly different one, and the difference is captured by a single calculable time- and _EQN_ -dependent function. EOS We then compute the redshift-space galaxy one-loop power spectrum with the EdS approximation (_EQN_) and without (_EQN_). EOS For the monopole we find _EQN_ and for the quadrupole _EQN_ at _EQN_, and sharply increasing at lower redshifts. EOS Finally, we show that a substantial fraction of the effect remains even after allowing the bias coefficients to shift within a physically allowed range.	This suggests that the EdS approximation can only fit the data to a level of precision that is roughly comparable to the precision of the next generation of cosmological surveys.
doc	Jordan types for graded Artinian algebras in height two EOS We let _EQN_ be a standard graded Artinian algebra quotient of _EQN_, the polynomial ring in two variables over a field _EQN_ by an ideal _EQN_, and let _EQN_ be its vector space dimension. EOS The Jordan type _EQN_ of a linear form _EQN_ is the partition of _EQN_ determining the Jordan block decomposition of the multiplication on _EQN_ by _EQN_ - which is nilpotent.	The first three authors previously determined which partitions of _EQN_ may occur as the Jordan type for some linear form _EQN_ on a graded complete intersection Artinian quotient _EQN_ of _EQN_, and they counted the number of such partitions for each complete intersection Hilbert function _EQN_ [arXiv:1810.00716].
doc	The Bruhat--Chevalley order on involutions of the hyperoctahedral group and combinatorics of _EQN_ -orbit closures EOS Let _EQN_ be the symplectic group, _EQN_ its root system, _EQN_ its standard Borel subgroup, _EQN_ the Weyl group of _EQN_. EOS To each involution _EQN_ one can assign the _EQN_ -orbit _EQN_ contained in the dual space of the Lie algebra of the unipotent radical of _EQN_.	We prove that _EQN_ is contained in the Zariski closure of _EQN_ if and only of _EQN_ with respect to the Bruhat--Chevalley order.
doc	Mesons in a soft-wall AdS-Schwarzschild approach at low temperature EOS We derive a holographic soft-wall approach in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild space for the description of mesons at finite temperature. EOS In this first application we consider the small temperature limit and derive analytical expression for the mass spectrum of mesons with adjustable quantum numbers _EQN_ (radial number), _EQN_ (angular orbital momentum) and _EQN_ (total angular momentum). EOS We explicitly separate the contribution at zero temperature and the leading order temperature correction. EOS The temperature corrections arise from the temperature dependence of the dilaton parameter (which is the parameter of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry related to the pseudoscalar meson decay constant) and the warping of the AdS metric due to temperature. EOS We extend our results to any hadron with integer spin (tetraquarks, dibaryons, etc.).	We present numerical analysis for the temperature dependence of meson masses and form factors.
doc	Polarized Narrow-Line Emission from the Nucleus of NGC 4258 EOS The detection of polarized continuum and line emission from the nucleus of NGC 4258 by Wilkes et al (1995) provides an intriguing application of the unified model of Seyfert nuclei to a galaxy in which there is known to be an edge-on, rotating disk of molecular gas surrounding the nucleus. EOS Unlike most Seyfert nuclei, however, NGC 4258 has strongly polarized narrow emission lines. EOS To further investigate the origin of the polarized emission, we have obtained spectropolarimetric observations of the NGC 4258 nucleus at the Keck-II telescope. EOS The narrow-line polarizations range from 1.0% for [S II] 6716 to 13.9% for the [O II] 7319,7331 blend, and the position angle of polarization is oriented nearly parallel to the projected plane of the masing disk.	A correlation between critical density and degree of polarization is detected for the forbidden lines, indicating that the polarized emission arises from relatively dense (n_e > 10^4 cm^-3) gas.
doc	Parity detection and entanglement with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer EOS A parity meter projects the state of two qubits onto two subspaces with different parities, the states in each parity class being indistinguishable. EOS It has application in quantum information for its entanglement properties. EOS In our work we consider the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) coupled capacitively to two double quantum dots (DQDs), one on each arm of the MZI. EOS These charge qubits couple linearly to the charge in the arms of the MZI. EOS A key advantage of an MZI is that the qubits are well separated in distance so that mutual interaction between them is avoided. EOS Assuming equal coupling between both DQDs and the arms and the same bias for each DQD, this setup usually detects three different currents, one for the odd states and two for each even state. EOS Controlling the magnetic flux of the MZI, we can operate the MZI as a parity meter: only two currents are measured at the output, one for each parity class.	In this configuration, the MZI acts as an ideal detector, its Heisenberg efficiency being maximal.
doc	Gravitational Shapiro Telescope on the PSR's period to discover Dark Planets and Machos EOS Collective Shapiro Phase Shift on the period of the pulsars due to a dark object (a passing MACHO or a planet) along the line-of-sight of one or more pulsar is a formidable gravitational tool to discover dark matter.We already noted that the presence of a few negative PSRs period, possibly due to such a Shapiro delay, is roughly consistent with independent estimates of MACHOs observed by microlensing in our Galaxy.	Here we update our study and suggest to verify and to calibrate the Shapiro phase delay to observe on ecliptic main known planetary and solar gravitational fields.
doc	Transition from local to global of dFHE and dWCHP EOS In a previous paper  the author studied the directed weak covering homotopy property (dWCHP)and directed weak fibrations in the category dTop of directed spaces in the sense of M. EOS Grandis,,. EOS This type of maps extend to the category dTop the well known Dold's (or weak)fibrations. EOS In this paper the transition from local to global of the dFHE (directed fiber homotopy equivalence) and the dWCHP are studied by proving two Dold type theorems and respectively a tom Dieck-Kamps-Puppe type theorem. EOS Some new notions of directed topology are defined: d-halo, d-SEP, d-numerable covering, d-shrinkable.	Some examples and counterexamples are given.
doc	Different response of the crystal structure to isoelectronic doping in BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 and [Ba(1-x)Sr(x)]Fe2As2 EOS Superconductivity up to 30 K in charge neutrally doped BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 has been ascribed to chemical pressure, caused by the shrinking unit cell. EOS But the latter induces no superconductivity in [Ba(1-x)Sr(x)]Fe2As2 in spite of the same volume range. EOS We show that the spin-density-wave (SDW) state of BaFe2As2 becomes suppressed in BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 by a subtle reorganization of the crystal structure, where arsenic and phosphorus are located at different coordinates z(As), z(P).	High-resolution X-ray diffraction experiments with BaFe2[As(1-x)P(x)]2 single crystals reveal almost unchanged Fe-P bonds, but a contraction of the Fe-As bonds, which remain nearly unchanged in [Ba(1-x)Sr(x)]Fe2As2.

doc	Phase space evolution of pairs created in strong electric fields EOS We study the process of energy conversion from overcritical electric field into electron-positron-photon plasma. EOS We solve numerically Vlasov-Boltzmann equations for pairs and photons assuming the system to be homogeneous and anisotropic. EOS All the 2-particle QED interactions between pairs and photons are described by collision terms. EOS We evidence several epochs of this energy conversion, each of them associated to a specific physical process.	Firstly pair creation occurs, secondly back reaction results in plasma oscillations.
doc	Full- and reduced-dimensionality instanton calculations of the tunnelling splitting in the formic acid dimer EOS The ring-polymer instanton approach is applied to compute the ground-state tunnelling splitting of four isotopomers of the formic acid dimer using the accurate PES of Qu and Bowman [Phys. EOS Chem. EOS Chem. EOS Phys., 2016, 18, 24835]. EOS As well as performing the calculations in full dimensionality, we apply a reduced-dimensionality approach to study how the results converge as successively more degrees of freedom are included. EOS The instanton approximation compares well to exact quantum results where they are available but shows that nearly all the modes are required to quantitatively obtain the tunnelling splitting.	The full-dimensional instanton calculation reproduces the experimental results, with an error of only about 20 percent.
doc	Thermal conductivity of the thermoelectric layered cobalt oxides measured by the Harman method EOS In-plane thermal conductivity of the thermoelectric layered cobalt oxides has been measured using the Harman method, in which thermal conductivity is obtained from temperature gradient induced by applied current. EOS We have found that the charge reservoir block (the block other than the CoO _EQN_ block) dominates the thermal conduction, where a nano-block integration concept is effective for material design.	We have further found that the thermal conductivity shows a small but finite in-plane anisotropy between _EQN_ and _EQN_ axes, which can be ascribed to the misfit structure.
doc	Fast Learning of Clusters and Topics via Sparse Posteriors EOS Mixture models and topic models generate each observation from a single cluster, but standard variational posteriors for each observation assign positive probability to all possible clusters. EOS This requires dense storage and runtime costs that scale with the total number of clusters, even though typically only a few clusters have significant posterior mass for any data point. EOS We propose a constrained family of sparse variational distributions that allow at most _EQN_ non-zero entries, where the tunable threshold _EQN_ trades off speed for accuracy.	Previous sparse approximations have used hard assignments (_EQN_), but we find that moderate values of _EQN_ provide superior performance.
doc	The Sizes and Depletions of the Dust and Gas Cavities in the Transitional Disk J160421.7-213028 EOS We report ALMA Cycle 2 observations of 230 GHz (1.3 mm) dust continuum emission, and _EQN_ CO, _EQN_ CO, and C _EQN_ O J = 2-1 line emission, from the Upper Scorpius transitional disk [PZ99] J160421.7-213028, with an angular resolution of ~0".25 (35 AU). EOS Armed with these data and existing H-band scattered light observations, we measure the size and depth of the disk's central cavity, and the sharpness of its outer edge, in three components: sub- _EQN_ m-sized "small" dust traced by scattered light, millimeter-sized "big" dust traced by the millimeter continuum, and gas traced by line emission. EOS Both dust populations feature a cavity of radius _EQN_ 70 AU that is depleted by factors of at least 1000 relative to the dust density just outside. EOS The millimeter continuum data are well explained by a cavity with a sharp edge. EOS Scattered light observations can be fitted with a cavity in small dust that has either a sharp edge at 60 AU, or an edge that transitions smoothly over an annular width of 10 AU near 60 AU. EOS In gas, the data are consistent with a cavity that is smaller, about 15 AU in radius, and whose surface density at 15 AU is _EQN_ times smaller than the surface density at 70 AU;	the gas density grades smoothly between these two radii.
doc	Blind Measurement Selection: A Random Matrix Theory Approach EOS This paper considers the problem of selecting a set of _EQN_ measurements from _EQN_ available sensor observations. EOS The selected measurements should minimize a certain error function assessing the error in estimating a certain _EQN_ dimensional parameter vector.	The exhaustive search inspecting each of the _EQN_ possible choices would require a very high computational complexity and as such is not practical for large _EQN_ and _EQN_.

doc	Cross-Attention End-to-End ASR for Two-Party Conversations EOS We present an end-to-end speech recognition model that learns interaction between two speakers based on the turn-changing information. EOS Unlike conventional speech recognition models, our model exploits two speakers' history of conversational-context information that spans across multiple turns within an end-to-end framework.	Specifically, we propose a speaker-specific cross-attention mechanism that can look at the output of the other speaker side as well as the one of the current speaker for better at recognizing long conversations.
doc	Combined Effect of Stacking and Magnetic Field on Plasmon Excitations in Bilayer Graphene EOS The electronic excitations of bilayer graphene (BLG) under a magnetic field are investigated with the use of the Peierls tight-binding model in conjunction with random-phase approximation (RPA). EOS The interlayer atomic interactions, interlayer Coulomb interactions, and magnetic field effects are simultaneously included in the dielectric-function matrix. EOS That enables us to derive the magneto-Coulomb-excitation spectrum of different stacking structures. EOS The two typical arrangements of BLGs, AB and AA, are considered in this article. EOS AB-BLG exhibits many discrete energy-loss peaks, which correspond to the quantization of electron energies. EOS On the other hand, the AA-BLG spectra possess a unique and pronounced peak at low frequency. EOS This peak represents the collective excitation of the entire low-frequency Landau states.	The dependence of the energy-loss peaks on the momentum transfer and the magnetic field strength is presented.
doc	A Geometric Approach to Dynamical Model-Order Reduction EOS Any model order reduced dynamical system that evolves a modal decomposition to approximate the discretized solution of a stochastic PDE can be related to a vector field tangent to the manifold of fixed rank matrices. EOS The Dynamically Orthogonal (DO) approximation is the canonical reduced order model for which the corresponding vector field is the orthogonal projection of the original system dynamics onto the tangent spaces of this manifold. EOS The embedded geometry of the fixed rank matrix manifold is thoroughly analyzed. EOS The curvature of the manifold is characterized and related to the smallest singular value through the study of the Weingarten map. EOS Differentiability results for the orthogonal projection onto embedded manifolds are reviewed and used to derive an explicit dynamical system for tracking the truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a time-dependent matrix. EOS It is demonstrated that the error made by the DO approximation remains controlled under the minimal condition that the original solution stays close to the low rank manifold, which translates into an explicit dependence of this error on the gap between singular values.	The DO approximation is also justified as the dynamical system that applies instantaneously the SVD truncation to optimally constrain the rank of the reduced solution.

doc	Doping-induced spin-manipulation in complex trimer system Ca _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ (PO _EQN_) _EQN_: A First Principles Study EOS Spin-manipulated doping with magnetic (Ni) and non-magnetic (Mg) dopants constitutes the experimental attempts to obtain a singlet ground state system from the linear chain Heisenberg antiferromagnetic Cu-based _EQN_ spin-1/2 trimer compound Ca _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ (PO _EQN_) _EQN_ with doublet ground state. EOS The present study is a first-principles based investigation of the effects of such doping on the spin-exchange mechanism and electronic structure of the parent compound.	Site-selective doping with zero-spin dopants like Mg is proved to be more efficient than an integral spin dopant Ni in obtaining a spin-gap system with singlet ground state, as also observed in the experimental studies.
doc	Learning and inference in a nonequilibrium Ising model with hidden nodes EOS We study inference and reconstruction of couplings in a partially observed kinetic Ising model. EOS With hidden spins, calculating the likelihood of a sequence of observed spin configurations requires performing a trace over the configurations of the hidden ones. EOS This, as we show, can be represented as a path integral. EOS Using this representation, we demonstrate that systematic approximate inference and learning rules can be derived using dynamical mean-field theory. EOS Although naive mean-field theory leads to an unstable learning rule, taking into account Gaussian corrections allows learning the couplings involving hidden nodes.	It also improves learning of the couplings between the observed nodes compared to when hidden nodes are ignored.
doc	Superconductivity of disordered Dirac fermions in graphene EOS We numerically study the interplay between superconductivity and disorder on the graphene honeycomb lattice with on-site Hubbard attractive interactions U using a spatially inhomogeneous self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) approach. EOS In the absence of disorder there are two phases at charge neutrality. EOS Below a critical value Uc for attractive interactions there is a Dirac semimetal phase and above it there is a superconducting phase. EOS We add scalar potential disorder to the system, while remaining at charge neutrality on average. EOS Numerical solution of the BdG equations suggests that while in the strong attraction regime (U > Uc) disorder has the usual effect of suppressing superconductivity, in the weak attraction regime (U < Uc) weak disorder enhances superconductivity. EOS In the weak attraction regime, disorder that is too strong eventually suppresses superconductivity, i.e., there is an optimal disorder strength that maximizes the critical temperature Tc. EOS Our numerical results also suggest that in the weakly disordered regime, mesoscopic inhomogeneities enhance superconductivity significantly more than what is predicted by a spatially uniform mean-field theory a` la Abrikosov-Gorkov.	In this regime, superconductivity consists of rare phase-coherent superconducting islands.
doc	An elliptic expansion of the potential field source surface model EOS Context. EOS The potential field source surface model is frequently used as a basis for further scientific investigations where a comprehensive coronal magnetic field is of importance. EOS Its parameters, especially the position and shape of the source surface, are crucial for the interpretation of the state of the interplanetary medium. EOS Improvements have been suggested that introduce one or more additional free parameters to the model, for example, the current sheet source surface (CSSS) model. EOS Aims. EOS Relaxing the spherical constraint of the source surface and allowing it to be elliptical gives modelers the option of deforming it to more accurately match the physical environment of the specific period or location to be analyzed.	Methods.
doc	A survey for the missing hydrogen in high redshift radio sources EOS Unlike at lower redshift, where there is a 40% detection rate, surveys for 21-cm absorption arising within the hosts of z > 1 radio galaxies and quasars have been remarkably unsuccessful. EOS Curran et al(2008) suggest that this is due to the high redshift selection biasing towards the most optically bright objects (those most luminous in the ultra-violetin the rest-frame), where the gas is ionised by the active galactic nucleus. EOS They therefore argue that there must be a population of fainter objects in which the hydrogen is not ionised and which exhibit a similar detection rate as at lower redshifts. EOS In order to find this "missing" gas at high redshift, we have therefore undertaken a survey of z > 2 radio sources, selected by optical faintness. EOS Despite having optical magnitudes which indicate that the targets have ultra-violet luminosities below the threshold where all of the gas is ionised, there were no detections in any of the eight sources for which useable data were obtained. EOS Upon an analysis of the spectral energy distributions, ionising photon rates can only be determined for three of these, all of which suggest that the objects are above the highest luminosity of a current 21-cm detection. EOS The possibility that the other five could be located at lower photon rates cannot be ruled out, although zero detections out of five is not statistically significant. EOS Another possible cause of the non-detections is that our selection biases the sample towards sources which are very steep in the radio band, with a mean spectral index of = -1.0, cf.	-0.3 for both the 21-cm detections and UV luminous non-detections.
doc	Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation from the Nonequilibrium Dynamics of a Nonlinear Open Quantum System EOS Continuing our inquiry into the conditions when fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDR) may appear in the context of nonequilibrium dynamics of open quantum systems (over and beyond the conventional FDR from linear response theory) we turn to nonGaussian systems and consider this issue for an anharmonic oscillator interacting with a scalar quantum field bath.	We present the general nonperturbative expressions for the rate of energy (power) exchange between the anharmonic oscillator and the thermal bath.
doc	A Quantum Mechanical Bound for Space-Energy Cost with Respect to the Von Neumann Entropy EOS This thesis discusses the possibility of uncertainty relations for space and energy given a state of fixed entropy. EOS In particular, it discusses the results in the paper of Dam/Nguyen. EOS There, the authors propose a lower bound for the mixed cost in energy and space required for physically storing information in a quantum mechanical system. EOS We first critically examine the justifications for the bound given in the paper.This is done from a mathematical point of view, in contrast to the more physically motivated original paper.Then we give two examples that illustrate the limitations of this inequality. EOS We also present numerical results to find an alternative energy-space bound in the finite dimensional version of this problem. EOS They indicate a slightly different version of the inequality.	In the end we describe a promising ansatz to find a lower energy-space bound that depends on the amount stored information.

While the ferroelectric polarization cannot be explained by the well-accepted spin current model nor exchange striction mechanism, we have shown that it is induced by the spin-dependent _EQN_ - _EQN_ hybridization between the transition-metal (Co) and ligand (O) via the spin-orbit interaction.

doc	Effect of dark energy sound speed and equation of state on CDM power spectrum EOS We study the influence of equation of state _EQN_ and effective sound speed _EQN_ of the dark energy perturbations on the cold dark matter(CDM) power spectrum.We consider different cases of the equation of state and the effective sound speed, the cold dark matter power spectrum is found to be generically suppressed in these cases as compared to the _EQN_ CDM model. EOS The suppression at different length scales depends on the value of _EQN_ and _EQN_, and the effect of different _EQN_ is profoundly seen at all length scales.	The influence of sound speed is significantly seen only at the intermediate length scales and is negligible at scales very much larger and smaller than the Hubble scale.
doc	The inner wind of IRC+10216 revisited: New exotic chemistry and diagnostic for dust condensation in carbon stars EOS Aims. EOS We model the chemistry of the inner wind of the carbon star IRC+10216 and consider the effect of periodic shocks induced by the stellar pulsation on the gas to follow the non-equilibrium chemistry in the shocked gas layers. EOS We consider a very complete set of chemical families, including hydrocarbons and aromatics, hydrides, halogens and phosphorous-bearing species. EOS Derived abundances are compared to the latest observational data from large surveys and Herschel. EOS Results. EOS The shocks induce a non-equilibrium chemistry in the dust formation zone of IRC+10216 where the collision destruction of CO in the post-shock gas triggers the formation of O-bearing species (H2O, SiO). EOS Most of the modelled abundances agree very well with the latest values derived from Herschel data on IRC+10216.	Hydrides form a family of abundant species that are expelled into the intermediate envelope.
doc	A Binary Origin for Blue Stragglers in Globular Clusters EOS Blue stragglers in globular clusters are abnormally massive stars that should have evolved off the stellar main sequence long ago. EOS There are two known processes that can create these objects: direct stellar collisions and binary evolution. EOS However, the relative importance of these processes has remained unclear. EOS In particular, the total number of blue stragglers found in a given cluster does not seem to correlate with the predicted collision rate, providing indirect support for the binary-evolution model. EOS Yet the radial distributions of blue stragglers in many clusters are bimodal, with a dominant central peak: this has been interpreted as an indication that collisions do dominate blue straggler production, at least in the high-density cluster cores. EOS Here we report that there is a clear, but sublinear, correlation between the number of blue stragglers found in a cluster core and the total stellar mass contained within it.	From this we conclude that most blue stragglers, even those found in cluster cores, come from binary systems.

EOS They are fitted by adjusting either 4 or 5 parameters: knee position, power law exponents above and below the knee, overall intensity and, in addition, a parameter describing the smoothness of the bend. EOS The residuals are then normalized to the same knee position and averaged.	When 5 parameters are employed no systematic deviation from a single smooth knee is apparent at the 1% level up to a factor of 4 above the knee.
doc	CGCG 292-057 - a radio galaxy with merger-modulated radio activity EOS We announce the discovery of a unique combination of features in a radio source identified with the merger galaxy CGCG 292-057. EOS The radio galaxy both exhibits a highly complex, X-like structure and shows signs of recurrent activity in the form of double-double morphology.	The outer lobes of CGCG 292-057 are characterized by low radio power, P_ 1400MHz \simeq 2 * 10^ 24 W\Hz^ -1, placing this source below the FRII/FRI luminosity threshold, and are highly polarized (almost 20 per cent at 1400 MHz) as is typical of X-shaped radio sources.
doc	Hypothesis testing for Markov chain Monte Carlo EOS Testing between hypotheses, when independent sampling is possible, is a well developed subject.

doc	Did LIGO detect dark matter? EOS We consider the possibility that the black-hole (BH) binary detected by LIGO may be a signature of dark matter. EOS Interestingly enough, there remains a window for masses _EQN_ where primordial black holes (PBHs) may constitute the dark matter. EOS If two BHs in a galactic halo pass sufficiently close, they radiate enough energy in gravitational waves to become gravitationally bound. EOS The bound BHs will rapidly spiral inward due to emission of gravitational radiation and ultimately merge. EOS Uncertainties in the rate for such events arise from our imprecise knowledge of the phase-space structure of galactic halos on the smallest scales.	Still, reasonable estimates span a range that overlaps the _EQN_ Gpc _EQN_ yr _EQN_ rate estimated from GW150914, thus raising the possibility that LIGO has detected PBH dark matter.
doc	Community Detection and Matrix Completion with Two-Sided Graph Side-Information EOS We consider the problem of recovering communities of users and communities of items (such as movies) based on a partially observed rating matrix as well as side-information in the form of similarity graphs of the users and items. EOS The user-to-user and item-to-item similarity graphs are generated according to the celebrated stochastic block model (SBM). EOS We develop lower and upper bounds on the minimum expected number of observed ratings (also known as the sample complexity) needed for this recovery task. EOS These bounds are functions of various parameters including the quality of the graph side-information which is manifested in the intra- and inter-cluster probabilities of the SBMs. EOS We show that these bounds match for a wide range of parameters of interest, and match up to a constant factor of two for the remaining parameter regime.	Our information-theoretic results quantify the benefits of the two-sided graph side-information for recovery, and further analysis reveals that the two pieces of graph side-information produce an interesting synergistic effect under certain scenarios.
doc	Evolution of Low- and Intermediate-Mass Stars with [Fe/H] <= -2.5 EOS We present extensive sets of stellar models for 0.8-9.0Msun in mass and -5 <= [Fe/H] <= -2 and Z = 0 in metallicity. EOS The present work focuses on the evolutionary characteristics of hydrogen mixing into the He-flash convective zones during the core and shell He flashes which occurs for the models with [Fe/H] <~ -2.5. EOS Evolution is followed from the zero age MS to the TPAGB phase including the hydrogen engulfment by the He-flash convection during the RGB or AGB phase. EOS There exist various types of mixing episodes of how the H mixing sets in and how it affects the final abundances at the surface. EOS In particular, we find H ingestion events without dredge-ups that enables repeated neutron-capture nucleosynthesis in the He flash convective zones with 13 C(a,n)16 O as neutron source. EOS For Z = 0, the mixing and dredge-up processes vary with the initial mass, which results in different final abundances in the surface. EOS We investigate the occurrence of these events for various initial mass and metallicity to find the metallicity dependence for the He-flash driven deep mixing (He-FDDM) and also for the third dredge-up (TDU) events. EOS In our models, we find He-FDDM for M <= 3Msun for Z = 0 and for M <~ 2Msun for -5 <~ [Fe/H] <~ -3. EOS On the other hand, the occurrence of the TDU is limited to the mass range of ~1.5Msun to ~5Msun for [Fe/H] = -3, which narrows with decreasing metallicity. EOS The paper also discusses the implications of the results of model computations for observations. EOS We compared the abundance pattern of CNO abundances with observed metal-poor stars.	The origins of most iron-deficient stars are discussed by assuming that these stars are affected by binary mass transfer.

doc	On the many saddle points description of quantum black holes EOS Considering two dimensional gravity coupled to a CFT, we show that a semiclassical black hole can be described in terms of two Liouville theories matched at the horizon. EOS The black hole exterior corresponds to a space-like while the interior to a time-like Liouville theory. EOS This matching automatically implies that a semiclassical black hole has an infinite entropy. EOS The path integral description of the time-like Liouville theory (the Black Hole interior) is studied and it is found that the correlation functions of the coupled CFT-gravity system are dominated by two (complex) saddle points, even in the semiclassical limit. EOS We argue that this system can be interpreted as two interacting Bose-Einstein condensates constructed out of two degenerate quantum states.	In AdS/CFT context, the same system is mapped into two interacting strings intersecting inside a three-dimensional BTZ black hole.
doc	Thermodynamically Consistent Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer Framework in Matrix Acidization EOS Matrix acidization is an important technique to enhance oil production at the tertiary recovery stage, and its numerical simulation is never concluded. EOS From one of the earliest models, i.e. EOS the two-scale model (Darcy framework), the Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer (DBF) framework is developed by adding Brinkman term and Forchheimer term to the momentum conservation equation. EOS However, in the momentum conservation equation of the DBF framework, porosity is put outside of the time derivation term, which cannot describe the change of porosity well. EOS Thus, this work changes the expression so that the modified momentum conservation equation can satisfy Newton's second law.	The modified framework is called improved DBF framework.

doc	Prediction Of A Multi-Center Bonded Solid Boron Hydride for Hydrogen Storage EOS An ideal material for on-board hydrogen storage must release hydrogen at practical temperature and pressure and also regenerate efficiently under similarly gentle conditions. EOS Therefore, thermodynamically, the hydride material must lie within a narrow range near the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation phase boundary. EOS Materials involving only conventional bonding mechanisms are unlikely to meet these requirements. EOS In contrast, materials containing certain frustrated bonding are designed to be on the verge of frustration-induced phase transition, and they may be better suited for hydrogen storage. EOS Here we propose a novel layered solid boron hydride and show its potential for hydrogen storage. EOS The absence of soft phonon modes confirms the dynamical stability of the structure. EOS Charging the structure significantly softens hydrogen-related phonon modes. EOS Boron-related phonons, in contrast, are either hardened or not significantly affected by electron doping.	These results suggest that electrochemical charging may facilitate hydrogen release while the underlying boron network remains intact for subsequent rehydrogenation.

doc	Generation and evolution of spin-, valley- and layer-polarized excited carriers in inversion-symmetric WSe2 EOS Manipulation of spin and valley degrees of freedom is a key step towards realizing novel quantum technologies, for which atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been established as promising candidates. EOS In monolayer TMDCs, the lack of inversion symmetry gives rise to a spin-valley correlation of the band structure allowing for valley-selective electronic excitation with circularly polarized light. EOS Here we show that, even in centrosymmetric samples of 2H-WSe2, circularly polarized light can generate spin-, valley- and layer-polarized excited states in the conduction band. EOS Employing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (trARPES) with spin-selective excitation, the dynamics of valley and layer pseudospins of the excited carriers are investigated. EOS Complementary time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of the excited state populations reveal a strong circular dichroism of the spin-, valley- and layer-polarizations and a pronounced 2D character of the excited states in the K valleys.	We observe scattering of carriers towards the global minimum of the conduction band on a sub-100 femtosecond timescale to states with three-dimensional character facilitating inter-layer charge transfer.
doc	An alternative method to study star cluster disruption EOS Many embedded star clusters do not evolve into long-lived bound clusters.

doc	Scission of flexible polymers in contraction flow: predicting the effects of multiple passages EOS When injected through a contraction, high molecular weight polymer solutions exhibit a sharp increase of apparent viscosity which originates from stretching polymer chains above a critical extension rate. EOS This chain stretching can also induce polymer scission, which then decreases the extensional viscosity. EOS In practice, the two phenomena are difficult to separate.	Moreover, these phenomena are often observed in situation where flow instabilities appear.
doc	Unsupervised Online Feature Selection for Cost-Sensitive Medical Diagnosis EOS In medical diagnosis, physicians predict the state of a patient by checking measurements (features) obtained from a sequence of tests, e.g., blood test, urine test, followed by invasive tests. EOS As tests are often costly, one would like to obtain only those features (tests) that can establish the presence or absence of the state conclusively. EOS Another aspect of medical diagnosis is that we are often faced with unsupervised prediction tasks as the true state of the patients may not be known. EOS Motivated by such medical diagnosis problems, we consider a Cost-Sensitive Medical Diagnosis (CSMD) problem, where the true state of patients is unknown. EOS We formulate the CSMD problem as a feature selection problem where each test gives a feature that can be used in a prediction model.	Our objective is to learn strategies for selecting the features that give the best trade-off between accuracy and costs.
doc	Numerical Modelling of Transport Processes in Semiconductors EOS The peculiarities of electric current in semiconductors with nonuniform distribution of charge carriers are studied. EOS The semiclassical drift-diffusion equations consisting of the continuity equations and the Poisson equation are solved numerically using Rusanov finite-difference scheme of third order. EOS The different types of boundary conditions are numerically investigated. EOS It is shown that the stability of the Rusanov scheme for the problem considered is achieved with the Neumann type boundary conditions. EOS These conditions correspond to the absence of diffusion through semiconductor surface. EOS Special set of parameters is found under which a very interesting and unusual transient effect of negative current in nonuniform semiconductors appears.	Different regimes of negative current are considered for realistic semiconductor materials.
doc	Structure and function of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli fimbriae from differing assembly pathways EOS Pathogenic enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the major bacterial cause of diarrhea in young children in developing countries and in travelers, causing significant mortality in children. EOS Adhesive fimbriae are a prime virulence factor for ETEC, initiating colonization of the small intestinal epithelium. EOS Similar to other Gram-negative bacteria, ETEC express one or more diverse fimbriae, some assembled by the chaperone-usher pathway and others by the alternate chaperone pathway. EOS Here we elucidate structural and biophysical aspects and adaptations of each fimbrial type to its respective host niche. EOS CS20 fimbriae are compared to CFA/I fimbriae, which are two ETEC fimbriae assembled via different pathways, and to Pfimbriae from uropathogenic E. EOS coli. EOS Many fimbriae unwind from their native helical filament to an extended linear conformation under force, thereby sustaining adhesion by reducing load at the point of contact between the bacterium and the target cell.	CFA/I fimbriae require the least force to unwind, followed by CS20 fimbriae and then P-fimbriae, which require the highest unwinding force.
doc	Lipschitz estimates in quasi-Banach Schatten ideals EOS We study the class of functions _EQN_ on _EQN_ satisfying a Lipschitz estimate in the Schatten ideal _EQN_ for _EQN_. EOS The corresponding problem with _EQN_ has been extensively studied, but the quasi-Banach range _EQN_ is by comparison poorly understood. EOS Using techniques from wavelet analysis, we prove that Lipschitz functions belonging to the homogeneous Besov class _EQN_ obey the estimate _EQN_ for all bounded self-adjoint operators _EQN_ and _EQN_ with _EQN_. EOS In the case _EQN_, our methods recover and provide a new perspective on a result of Peller that _EQN_ is sufficient for a function to be Lipschitz in _EQN_.	We also provide related H\"older-type estimates, extending results of Aleksandrov and Peller.

doc	A Simple Linear Ranking Algorithm Using Query Dependent Intercept Variables EOS The LETOR website contains three information retrieval datasets used as a benchmark for testing machine learning ideas for ranking. EOS Algorithms participating in the challenge are required to assign score values to search results for a collection of queries, and are measured using standard IR ranking measures (NDCG, precision, MAP) that depend only the relative score-induced order of the results. EOS Similarly to many of the ideas proposed in the participating algorithms, we train a linear classifier. EOS In contrast with other participating algorithms, we define an additional free variable (intercept, or benchmark) for each query. EOS This allows expressing the fact that results for different queries are incomparable for the purpose of determining relevance. EOS The cost of this idea is the addition of relatively few nuisance parameters. EOS Our approach is simple, and we used a standard logistic regression library to test it. EOS The results beat the reported participating algorithms.	Hence, it seems promising to combine our approach with other more complex ideas.

doc	Chiral universality class of the normal-superconducting and the exciton condensation transition on the surface of topological insulator EOS New two dimensional systems like surface of topological insulator and graphene offer a possibility to experimentally investigate situations considered "exotic" just a decade ago. EOS One of those is the quantum phase transition of the "chiral" type in electronic systems with relativistic spectrum. EOS Phonon mediated ("conventional") pairing in the Dirac semimetal appearing on the surface of topological insulator leads to transition into a chiral superconducting state, while exciton condensation in these gapless systems has been envisioned long time ago in the physics of the narrow band semiconductors. EOS Starting from the microscopic Dirac Hamiltonian with local attraction or repulsion, the BCS type gaussian approximation is developed in the framework of functional integrals. EOS It is shown that due to an "ultra-relativistic" dispersion relation there is a quantum critical point governing the zero temperature transition to a superconducting or the exciton condensed state.	The quantum transitions that have critical exponents very different from the conventional ones.
doc	NUCLEAR SUPPRESSION OF HADROPRODUCTION EOS We demonstrate that the main part of the observed nuclear suppression of dilepton and charmonium production, especially the x-dependence of the suppression, can be explained by the absorption of fast initial partons. EOS We assume the absorption to be x1-dependent and determine the empirical form of this dependence. EOS Several reactions at different energies are described with the same parametrization of the absorption cross section. EOS The factorization theorem constraints and some alternative models are discussed.	The obtained description of data allows to make conclusions about the origin of nuclear effects in hadro- and electroproduction.

EOS By contrast, the spectrum for a pseudoscalar Higgs is _EQN_.	There are characteristic energy correlations between _EQN_ and _EQN_ and between _EQN_ and _EQN_.

EOS The age of the universe for the best estimated model parameters is found to be less than observational value.	The viscous matter behaves like stiff fluid in the early evolutionary phase and then evolves to a negative pressure fluid in the later phase.

doc	Avoidance of singularities in asymptotically safe Quantum Einstein Gravity EOS New general spherically symmetric solutions have been derived with a cosmological "constant" \Lambda as a source. EOS This \Lambda field is not constant but it satisfies the properties of the asymptotically safe gravity at the ultraviolet fixed point. EOS The importance of these solutions comes from the fact that they describe the near to the centre region of black hole spacetimes as this is modified by the Renormalization Group scaling behaviour of the fields. EOS The consistent set of field equations which respect the Bianchi identities is derived and solved. EOS One of the solutions (with conventional sign of temporal-radial metric components) is timelike geodesically complete, and although there is still a curvature divergent origin, this is never approachable by an infalling massive particle which is reflected at a finite distance due to the repulsive origin.	Another family of solutions (of both signatures) range from a finite radius outwards, they cannot be extended to the centre of spherical symmetry, and the curvature invariants are finite at the minimum radius.

doc	Regarding the Line-of-Sight Baryonic Acoustic Feature in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Luminous Red Galaxy Samples EOS We analyze the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature in the two-point correlation function \xi of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample (0.16 < z < 0.47). EOS By defining a narrow line-of-sight region, rp < 5.5 Mpc/h, where rp is the transverse separation component, we measure a strong excess of clustering at ~ 110 Mpc/h, as previously reported in the literature. EOS We also test these results in an alternative coordinate system, by defining the line-of-sight as \theta < 3 \deg, where \theta is the opening angle. EOS This clustering excess appears much stronger than the feature in the better-measured monopole. EOS A fiducial \Lambda CDM non-linear model in redshift-space predicts a much weaker signature. EOS We use realistic mock catalogs to model the expected signal and noise. EOS We find that the line-of-sight measurements can be explained well by our mocks as well as by a featureless \xi = 0. EOS We conclude that there is no convincing evidence that the strong clustering measurement is the line-of-sight baryonic acoustic feature. EOS We also evaluate how detectable such a signal would be in the upcoming Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey LRG volume (BOSS). EOS Mock LRG catalogs (z < 0.6) suggest that: (i) the narrow line- of-sight cylinder and cone defined above probably will not reveal a detectable acoustic feature in BOSS;	(ii) a clustering measurement as high as that in the current sample can be ruled out (or confirmed) at a high confidence level using a BOSS-sized data set;

doc	Emergence of a Broad-Absorption-Line Outflow in the Narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy WPVS 007 EOS We report results from a 2003 FUSE observation, and reanalysis of a 1996 HST observation of the unusual X-ray transient Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy WPVS 007. EOS The HST FOS spectrum revealed mini-BALs with V_max ~ 900 km s^-1 and FWHM ~ 550 km s^-1. EOS The FUSE spectrum showed that an additional BAL outflow with V_max ~ 6000 km s^-1 and FWHM ~ 3400 km s^-1 had appeared. EOS WPVS 007 is a low-luminosity object in which such a high velocity outflow is not expected; EOS therefore, it is an outlier on the M_V/V_max relationship.	Template spectral fitting yielded apparent ionic columns, and a Cloudy analysis showed that the presence of PV requires a high ionization parameter log(U) >= 0 and high column density log(N_H) >= 23 assuming solar abundances and a nominal SED for low-luminosity NLS1s with alpha_ox=-1.28.
doc	Quantum tunneling devices incorporating two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors EOS Research in two-dimensional (2D) materials has experienced rapid growth in the past few years.

EOS The nature of the 2D phases can be different than their bulk counterparts, making such systems attractive for fundamental studies.	Owing to their high crystallinity and absence of dangling bonds, devices and heterostructures incorporating these materials may also show performance exceeding that of traditional films.
doc	Spectral mixture analysis of EELS spectrum-images EOS Recent advances in detectors and computer science have enabled the acquisition and the processing of multidimensional datasets, in particular in the field of spectral imaging. EOS Benefiting from these new developments, earth scientists try to recover the reflectance spectra of macroscopic materials (e.g., water, grass, mineral types...) present in an observed scene and to estimate their respective proportions in each mixed pixel of the acquired image. EOS This task is usually referred to as spectral mixture analysis or spectral unmixing (SU).	SU aims at decomposing the measured pixel spectrum into a collection of constituent spectra, called endmembers, and a set of corresponding fractions (abundances) that indicate the proportion of each endmember present in the pixel.
doc	The XMM Cluster Survey: Active Galactic Nuclei and Starburst Galaxies in XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z=1.46 EOS We use Chandra X-ray and Spitzer infrared observations to explore the AGN and starburst populations of XMMXCS J2215.9-1738 at z=1.46, one of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters known. EOS The high resolution X-ray imaging reveals that the cluster emission is contaminated by point sources that were not resolved in XMM observations of the system, and have the effect of hardening the spectrum, leading to the previously reported temperature for this system being overestimated. EOS From a joint spectroscopic analysis of the Chandra and XMM data, the cluster is found to have temperature T=4.1_-0.9^+0.6 keV and luminosity L_X=(2.92_-0.35^+0.24)x10^44 erg/s extrapolated to a radius of 2 Mpc. EOS As a result of this revised analysis, the cluster is found to lie on the sigma_v-T relation, but the cluster remains less luminous than would be expected from self-similar evolution of the local L_X-T relation. EOS Two of the newly discovered X-ray AGN are cluster members, while a third object, which is also a prominent 24 micron source, is found to have properties consistent with it being a high redshift, highly obscured object in the background. EOS We find a total of eight >5 sigma 24 micron sources associated with cluster members (four spectroscopically confirmed, and four selected using photometric redshifts), and one additional 24 micron source with two possible optical/near-IR counterparts that may be associated with the cluster. EOS Examining the IRAC colors of these sources, we find one object is likely to be an AGN. EOS Assuming that the other 24 micron sources are powered by star formation, their infrared luminosities imply star formation rates ~100 M_sun/yr.	We find that three of these sources are located at projected distances of <250 kpc from the cluster center, suggesting that a large amount of star formation may be taking place in the cluster core, in contrast to clusters at low redshift.

EOS While many efforts are made to minimize the possibility of motion during a scan, relatively little attention has been given to motion compensation after the acquisition. EOS Methods: In a previous study, we proposed a retrospective motion compensation approach for helical head CT imaging, which iteratively estimates and compensates for rigid head motion. EOS This study reports on an extension of the previous method to cone-beam CT imaging.	To address the issue of the limited field-of-view, improvements were made to the original method.

EOS Let _EQN_ be a positive Borel measure on _EQN_ possessing finite moments up to degree _EQN_. EOS If the support of _EQN_ is contained in an algebraic curve of degree _EQN_, then we show that there exists a quadrature rule for _EQN_ with at most _EQN_ many nodes all placed on the curve (and positive weights) that is exact on all polynomials of degree at most _EQN_.	This generalizes both Gauss and (the odd degree case of) Szeg\H o quadrature where the curve is a line and a circle, respectively, to arbitrary plane algebraic curves.
doc	Time-Optimal Path Tracking via Reachability Analysis EOS Given a geometric path, the Time-Optimal Path Tracking problem consists in finding the control strategy to traverse the path time-optimally while regulating tracking errors. EOS A simple yet effective approach to this problem is to decompose the controller into two components: (i)~a path controller, which modulates the parameterization of the desired path in an online manner, yielding a reference trajectory; EOS and (ii)~a tracking controller, which takes the reference trajectory and outputs joint torques for tracking.	However, there is one major difficulty: the path controller might not find any feasible reference trajectory that can be tracked by the tracking controller because of torque bounds.
doc	The Spectroscopic Properties of Bright Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae EOS The properties of bright extragalactic planetary nebulae are reviewed based upon the results of low and high resolution spectroscopy. EOS It is argued that bright extragalactic planetary nebulae from galaxies (or subsystems) with and without star formation have different distributions of central star temperature and ionization structure. EOS As regards the chemical compositions, oxygen and neon are generally found to be unchanged as a result of the evolution of the stellar progenitors. EOS Nitrogen enrichment may occur as a result of the evolution of the progenitors of bright planetary nebulae in all stellar populations, though this enrichment may be (more) random in old stellar populations.	Helium abundances appear to be influenced by the chemical evolution of the host galaxy, with planetary nebulae in dwarf spheroidals having systematically elevated abundances.
doc	Privacy attitudes and concerns in the digital lives of older adults: Westin's privacy attitude typology revisited EOS There is a growing literature on teenage and young adult users' attitudes toward and concerns about online privacy, yet little is known about older adults and their unique experiences. EOS As older adults join the digital world in growing numbers, we need to gain a better understanding of how they experience and navigate online privacy. EOS This paper fills this research gap by examining 40 in-depth interviews with older adults (65 and older) living in East York, Toronto. EOS We found Westin's typology to be a useful starting point for understanding privacy attitudes and concerns in this demographic. EOS We expand Westin's typology and distinguish five categories: fundamentalist, intense pragmatist, relaxed pragmatist, marginally concerned, and cynical expert. EOS We find that older adults are not a homogenous group composed of privacy fundamentalists; EOS rather, there is considerable variability in terms of their privacy attitudes, with only 13 per cent being fundamentalists. EOS We also identify a group of cynical experts who believe that online privacy breaches are inevitable. EOS A large majority of older adults are marginally concerned, as they see their online participation as limited and harmless. EOS Older adults were also grouped as either intense or relaxed pragmatists.	We find that some privacy concerns are shared by older adults across several categories, the most common being spam, unauthorized access to personal information, and information misuse.

EOS First, we demonstrate two basic requirements for the precoding and combining matrices, including that all the entries therein should have constant amplitude under the implementation architecture constraint, and the average transmission power over the total K time slots taking for synchronization should be constant for any spatial direction. EOS Then, we derive the optimal synchronization detector based on generalized likelihood ratio test. EOS By utilizing this detector, we analyze the effect of the precoding and combining matrices to the missed detection probability and the false alarm probability, respectively, and present the corresponding conditions that should be satisfied. EOS It is shown that, both of the precoding and combining matrices should guarantee the perfect omnidirectional coverage at each time slot, i.e., the average transmission power at each time slot is constant for any spatial direction, which is more strict than the second basic requirement mentioned above.	We also show that such omnidirectional precoding matrices and omnidirectional combining matrices exist only when both of the number of transmit streams and the number of receive streams are equal to or greater than two.

EOS The corresponding Vi\`ete-type infinite products for zeros of _EQN_ are also provided.	This allows us to obtain a special kind of closed-form representation for _EQN_ based on the Weierstrass-Hadamard factorization.

With this method we show that for almost all prime numbers there exist three-dimensional quartic hypersurface domains and modules of finite length with irrational Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity.
doc	The Evolution of Oxygen and Magnesium in the Bulge and Disk of the Milky Way EOS We show that the Galactic bulge and disk share a similar, strong, decline in [O/Mg] ratio with [Mg/H]. EOS The similarity of the [O/Mg] trend in these two, markedly different, populations suggests a metallicity-dependent modulation of the stellar yields from massive stars, by mass loss from winds, and related to the Wolf-Rayet phenomenon, as proposed by McWilliam & Rich (2004). EOS We have modified existing models for the chemical evolution of the Galactic bulge and the solar neighborhood with the inclusion of metallicity-dependent oxygen yields from theoretical predictions for massive stars that include mass loss by stellar winds. EOS Our results significantly improve the agreement between predicted and observed [O/Mg] ratios in the bulge and disk above solar metallicity; EOS however, a small zero-point normalization problem remains to be resolved.	The zero-point shift indicates that either the semi-empirical yields of Francois et al (2004) need adjustment, or that the bulge IMF is not quite as flat as found by Ballero et al (2007);
doc	Search for Supersymmetry in Events with b Jets and Missing Transverse Momentum at the LHC EOS A search for supersymmetry is presented using a sample of events with b jets and missing transverse momentum. EOS The search uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 inverse picobarns, collected with the CMS detector. EOS A total of 0.33 +0.43 -0.33 (stat.) +/- 0.13 (syst.) events is predicted, using control samples in the data, to arise from standard model processes, and one event is observed in the data.	Upper limits are set at the 95% confidence level on the cross sections of benchmark supersymmetric models.
doc	Secretary Ranking with Minimal Inversions EOS We study a twist on the classic secretary problem, which we term the secretary ranking problem: elements from an ordered set arrive in random order and instead of picking the maximum element, the algorithm is asked to assign a rank, or position, to each of the elements. EOS The rank assigned is irrevocable and is given knowing only the pairwise comparisons with elements previously arrived. EOS The goal is to minimize the distance of the rank produced to the true rank of the elements measured by the Kendall-Tau distance, which corresponds to the number of pairs that are inverted with respect to the true order. EOS Our main result is a matching upper and lower bound for the secretary ranking problem.	We present an algorithm that ranks _EQN_ elements with only _EQN_ inversions in expectation, and show that any algorithm necessarily suffers _EQN_ inversions when there are _EQN_ available positions.

EOS In the previous work [J. EOS Phys. EOS Soc. EOS Jpn.	87, 113701 (2018)], the velocity of the cone was calculated at respective Dirac points on the nodal loop based on our first-principles band structure calculations, which was a new method to derive an effective Hamiltonian with a 2 x 2 matrix.
doc	Probing _EQN_ and _EQN_ anomalous couplings in the process of _EQN_ EOS Rare decay of the Higgs boson is a powerful tool to probe new physics beyond the standard model. EOS The rare decays occur through quantum loops in which the standard model and new physics contributions might cancel each other out. EOS We consider a faked-no-new-physics scenario that the new physics contributions are about minus two times the standard model contribution such that partial widths of Higgs boson rare decays are the same as the standard model predictions.	We propose to measure the _EQN_ and _EQN_ anomalous couplings in the process of _EQN_ that is strongly correlated to Higgs boson rare decays.

doc	Quantized surface magnetism and higher-order topology: Application to the Hopf insulator EOS We identify topological aspects of the subextensive magnetic moment contributed by the surfaces of a three-dimensional crystallite -- assumed to be insulating in the bulk as well as on all surface facets, with trivial Chern invariants in the bulk. EOS The geometric component of this subextensive moment is given by its derivative with respect to the chemical potential, at zero temperature and zero field, per unit surface area, and hence corresponds to the surface magnetic compressibility.	The sum of the surface compressibilities contributed by two opposite facets of a cube-shaped crystallite is quantized to an integer multiple of the fundamental constant _EQN_ ;
doc	Do your volatility smiles take care of extreme events? EOS In the Black-Scholes context we consider the probability distribution function (PDF) of financial returns implied by volatility smile and we study the relation between the decay of its tails and the fitting parameters of the smile. EOS We show that, considering a scaling law derived from data, it is possible to get a new fitting procedure of the volatility smile that considers also the exponential decay of the real PDF of returns observed in the financial markets.	Our study finds application in the Risk Management activities where the tails characterization of financial returns PDF has a central role for the risk estimation.
doc	Measurement of Reconstructed Charged Particle Multiplicities of Neutrino Interactions in MicroBooNE EOS We compare the observed charged particle multiplicity distributions in the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber from neutrino interactions in a restricted final state phase space to predictions of this distribution from several GENIE models. EOS The measurement uses a data sample consisting of neutrino interactions with a final state muon candidate fully contained within the MicroBooNE detector.	These data were collected in 2015-2016 with the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB), which has an average neutrino energy of 800 MeV, using an exposure corresponding to 5e19 protons-on-target.
doc	The Super - Kamiokande Day - Night Effect Data and the MSW Solutions of the Solar Neutrino Problem EOS The current Super-Kamiokande data on the D-N asymmetry between the the day event rate and the Night and Core event rates, produced by solar neutrinos which respectively cross the Earth along any trajectory and cross the Earth core before reaching the detector, imply rather stringent constraints on the MSW small mixing angle (SMA) _EQN_ solution of the solar neutrino problem. EOS A simplified analysis shows, in particular, that a substantial subregion of the SMA solution region is disfavored by these data.	The Core D-N asymmetry data alone allow to rule out at 99.7% C.L.

doc	Spatio-temporal correlations in models of collective motion ruled by different dynamical laws EOS Information transfer is an essential factor in determining the robustness of collective behaviour in biological systems with distributed control. EOS The most direct way to study the information transfer mechanisms is to experimentally detect the propagation across the system of a signal triggered by some perturbation.	However, for field experiments this method is inefficient, as the possibilities of the observer to perturb the group are limited and empirical observations must rely on rare natural perturbations.
doc	Horizontal-Branch Models and the Second-Parameter Effect. III. The Impact of Mass Loss on the Red Giant Branch, and the Case of M5 and Palomar 4/Eridanus EOS Deep HST photometry has recently been presented for the outer-halo globular clusters Palomar 4 and Eridanus. EOS The new high-precision color-magnitude diagrams obtained for these globulars have allowed a measurement of their ages relative to M5 (NGC 5904), which is a well-observed, much closer cluster. EOS Assuming that the globular clusters share the same chemical composition, Pal 4/Eridanus have been reported to be younger than M5 by ~1-2 Gyr, based on both the magnitude difference between the horizontal branch (HB) and the turnoff and the difference in color between the turnoff and the lower subgiant branch. EOS In the present article, we address the following question: What age difference would be required to account for the difference in HB types between M5 and Pal 4/Eridanus, assuming age to be the "second parameter"? EOS We find that, unless all these clusters (including M5) are younger than 10 Gyr, such an age difference is substantially larger than that based on an analysis of the cluster turnoffs.	To reach such a conclusion, six different analytical mass loss rate formulae (reported in an Appendix), all implying a dependence of mass loss on the red giant branch on age, were employed.
doc	The jet-powered optical nebula of Cygnus X-1 EOS We present H-alpha and [O III] (5007 Angstroms) images of the nebula powered by the jet of the black hole candidate and microquasar Cygnus X-1, observed with the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT). EOS The ring-like structure is luminous in [O III] and there exists a thin outer shell with a high [O III] / H-alpha flux ratio. EOS This outer shell probably originates in the collisionally excited atoms close to the front of the bow shock.	Its presence indicates that the gas is shock excited as opposed to photoionised, supporting the jet-powered scenario.
doc	Hamiltonian-based Algorithm for Relaxed Optimal Control EOS This paper concerns a first-order algorithmic technique for a class of optimal control problems defined on switched-mode hybrid systems. EOS The salient feature of the algorithm is that it avoids the computation of Fr\'echet or G\^ateaux derivatives of the cost functional, which can be time consuming, but rather moves in a projected-gradient direction that is easily computable (for a class of problems) and does not require any explicit derivatives. EOS The algorithm is applicable to a class of problems where a pointwise minimizer of the Hamiltonian is computable by a simple formula, and this includes many problems that arise in theory and applications. EOS The natural setting for the algorithm is the space of continuous-time relaxed controls, whose special structure renders the analysis simpler than the setting of ordinary controls. EOS While the space of relaxed controls has theoretical advantages, its elements are abstract entities that may not be amenable to computation. EOS Therefore, a key feature of the algorithm is that it computes adequate approximations to relaxed controls without loosing its theoretical convergence properties.	Simulation results, including cpu times, support the theoretical developments.

doc	A Game-Theoretic Approach to Energy-Efficient Power Control in Multi-Carrier CDMA Systems EOS A game-theoretic model for studying power control in multi-carrier CDMA systems is proposed. EOS Power control is modeled as a non-cooperative game in which each user decides how much power to transmit over each carrier to maximize its own utility. EOS The utility function considered here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted over all the carriers per Joule of energy consumed and is particularly suitable for networks where energy efficiency is important. EOS The multi-dimensional nature of users' strategies and the non-quasiconcavity of the utility function make the multi-carrier problem much more challenging than the single-carrier or throughput-based-utility case. EOS It is shown that, for all linear receivers including the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) detector, a user's utility is maximized when the user transmits only on its "best" carrier. EOS This is the carrier that requires the least amount of power to achieve a particular target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the output of the receiver. EOS The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the proposed power control game are studied. EOS In particular, conditions are given that must be satisfied by the channel gains for a Nash equilibrium to exist, and the distribution of the users among the carriers at equilibrium is also characterized. EOS In addition, an iterative and distributed algorithm for reaching the equilibrium (when it exists) is presented.	It is shown that the proposed approach results in significant improvements in the total utility achieved at equilibrium compared to a single-carrier system and also to a multi-carrier system in which each user maximizes its utility over each carrier independently.
doc	Sea-level projections representing deeply uncertain ice-sheet contributions EOS Future sea-level rise poses nontrivial risks for many coastal communities. EOS Managing these risks often relies on consensus projections like those provided by the IPCC. EOS Yet, there is a growing awareness that the surrounding uncertainties may be much larger than typically perceived. EOS Recently published sea-level projections appear widely divergent and highly sensitive to non-trivial model choices and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) may be much less stable than previously believed, enabling a rapid disintegration. EOS In response, some agencies have already announced to update their projections accordingly. EOS Here, we present a set of probabilistic sea-level projections that approximate deeply uncertain WAIS contributions. EOS The projections aim to inform robust decisions by clarifying the sensitivity to non-trivial or controversial assumptions. EOS We show that the deeply uncertain WAIS contribution can dominate other uncertainties within decades. EOS These deep uncertainties call for the development of robust adaptive strategies.	These decision-making needs, in turn, require mission-oriented basic science, for example about potential signposts and the maximum rate of WAIS induced sea-level changes.
doc	An Efficient Algorithm to Compute Norms for Finite Horizon, Linear Time-Varying Systems EOS We present an efficient algorithm to compute the induced norms of finite-horizon Linear Time-Varying (LTV) systems. EOS The formulation includes both induced _EQN_ and terminal Euclidean norm penalties. EOS Existing computational approaches include the power iteration and bisection of a Riccati Differential Equation (RDE). EOS The power iteration has low computation time per iteration but overall convergence can be slow. EOS In contrast, the RDE condition provides guaranteed bounds on the induced gain but single RDE integration can be slow. EOS The complementary features of these two algorithms are combined to develop a new algorithm that is both fast and provides provable upper and lower bounds on the induced norm within the desired tolerance. EOS The algorithm also provides a worst-case disturbance input that achieves the lower bound on the norm. EOS We also present a new proof which shows that the power iteration for this problem converges monotonically. EOS Finally, we show a controllability Gramian based simpler computational method for induced _EQN_ -to-Euclidean norm. EOS This can be used to compute the reachable set at any time on the horizon.	Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed algorithm.

doc	Hybrid Multi-camera Visual Servoing to Moving Target EOS Visual servoing is a well-known task in robotics. EOS However, there are still challenges when multiple visual sources are combined to accurately guide the robot or occlusions appear. EOS In this paper we present a novel visual servoing approach using hybrid multi-camera input data to lead a robot arm accurately to dynamically moving target points in the presence of partial occlusions. EOS The approach uses four RGBD sensors as Eye-to-Hand (EtoH) visual input, and an arm-mounted stereo camera as Eye-in-Hand (EinH). EOS A Master supervisor task selects between using the EtoH or the EinH, depending on the distance between the robot and target.	The Master also selects the subset of EtoH cameras that best perceive the target.
doc	Constraining the Emission Geometry and Mass of the White Dwarf Pulsar AR Sco using the Rotating Vector Model EOS We apply the standard radio pulsar rotating vector model to the white dwarf pulsar AR Sco's optical polarization position angle swings folded at the white dwarf's spin period as obtained by Buckley et al (2017). EOS Owing to the long duty cycle of spin pulsations with a good signal-to-noise ratio over the entire spin phase, in contrast to neutron star radio pulsars, we find well-constrained values for the magnetic obliquity _EQN_ and observer viewing direction _EQN_ with respect to the spin axis. EOS We find _EQN_ and _EQN_, implying an orthogonal rotator with an observer angle _EQN_. EOS This orthogonal nature of the rotator is consistent with the optical light curve consisting of two pulses per spin period, separated by _EQN_ in phase.	Under the assumption that _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the orbital inclination, and a Roche-lobe-filling companion M star, we obtain _EQN_ for the white dwarf mass.
doc	Dosimetry and calorimetry performance of a scientific CMOS camera for environmental monitoring EOS This paper explores the prospect of CMOS devices to assay lead in drinking water, using calorimetry. EOS Lead occurs together with traces of radioisotopes, e.g. EOS Lead-210, producing _EQN_ -emissions with energies ranging from 10 keV to several 100 keV when they decay; EOS this range is detectable in silicon sensors. EOS In this paper we test a CMOS camera (Oxford Instruments Neo 5.5) for its general performance as a detector of x-rays and low energy _EQN_ -rays and assess its sensitivity relative to the World Health Organization upper limit on lead in drinking water. EOS Energies from 6 keV to 60 keV are examined. EOS The CMOS camera has a linear energy response over this range and its energy resolution is for the most part slightly better than 2 %. EOS The Neo sCMOS is not sensitive to x-rays with energies below _EQN_.	The smallest detectable rate is 40 _EQN_ 3 mHz, corresponding to an incident activity on the chip of 7 _EQN_ 4 Bq.

EOS High resolution spectroscopy for 7 and L' detections of 4 extend their SEDs shortwards of Ly_alpha or redwards of 7500 AA.	The average luminosities within a set of narrow, line-free, windows are computed.
doc	Synthesis of Data Word Transducers EOS In reactive synthesis, the goal is to automatically generate an implementation from a specification of the reactive and non-terminating input/output behaviours of a system. EOS Specifications are usually modelled as logical formulae or automata over infinite sequences of signals (_EQN_ -words), while implementations are represented as transducers. EOS In the classical setting, the set of signals is assumed to be finite. EOS In this paper, we do not make such an assumption and consider data _EQN_ -words instead, i.e., words over an infinite alphabet. EOS In this context, we study specifications and implementations respectively given as automata and transducers extended with a finite set of registers. EOS We consider different instances, depending on whether the specification is nondeterministic, universal or deterministic, and depending on whether the number of registers of the implementation is given (bounded synthesis) or not.	In the unbounded setting, we show undecidability for both universal and non-deterministic specifications, while decidability is recovered in the deterministic case.
doc	Strong Equivalence, Lorentz and CPT Violation, Anti-Hydrogen Spectroscopy and Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimetry EOS The strong equivalence principle, local Lorentz invariance and CPT symmetry are fundamental ingredients of the quantum field theories used to describe elementary particle physics. EOS Nevertheless, each may be violated by simple modifications to the dynamics while apparently preserving the essential fundamental structure of quantum field theory itself. EOS In this paper, we analyse the construction of strong equivalence, Lorentz and CPT violating Lagrangians for QED and review and propose some experimental tests in the fields of astrophysical polarimetry and precision atomic spectroscopy.	In particular, modifications of the Maxwell action predict a birefringent rotation of the direction of linearly polarised radiation from synchrotron emission which may be studied using radio galaxies or, potentially, gamma-ray bursts.

doc	Markov basis and Groebner basis of Segre-Veronese configuration for testing independence in group-wise selections EOS We consider testing independence in group-wise selections with some restrictions on combinations of choices. EOS We present models for frequency data of selections for which it is easy to perform conditional tests by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.	When the restrictions on the combinations can be described in terms of a Segre-Veronese configuration, an explicit form of a Gr\"obner basis consisting of moves of degree two is readily available for performing a Markov chain.
doc	Extension of self-seeding to hard X-rays >10 keV as a way to increase user access at the European XFEL EOS We propose to use the self-seeding scheme with single crystal monochromator at the European X-ray FEL to produce monochromatic, high-power radiation at 16 keV. EOS Based on start to end simulations we show that the FEL power of the transform-limited pulses can reach about 100 GW by exploiting tapering in the tunable-gap baseline undulator. EOS The combination of high photon energy, high peak power, and very narrow bandwidth opens a vast new range of applications, and includes the possibility to considerably increase the user capacity and fully exploit the high repetition rate of the European XFEL. EOS In fact, dealing with monochromatic hard X-ray radiation one may use crystals as deflectors with minimum beam loss. EOS To this end, a photon beam distribution system based on the use of crystals in the Bragg reflection geometry is proposed for future study and possible extension of the baseline facility. EOS They can be repeated a number of times to form an almost complete (one meter scale) ring with an angle of 20 degrees between two neighboring lines.	The reflectivity of crystal deflectors can be switched fast enough by flipping the crystals with piezo-electric devices similar to those for X-ray phase retarders at synchrotron radiation facilities.
doc	Noether and Belinfante corrected types of currents for perturbations in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity EOS In the framework of an arbitrary _EQN_ -dimensional metric theory, perturbations are considered on arbitrary backgrounds that are however solutions of the theory.

EOS Using generalized formulae, currents in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity for arbitrary types of perturbations on arbitrary curved backgrounds (not only vacuum) are constructed in an explicit covariant form.

doc	Collaborative peer production as an alternative to hierarchical internet based business systems EOS As we move towards more data intensive, device centric global communication networks, our ability to usefully harvest these large datastores is degrading. EOS The widening asymmetry in the explosive growth of data versus our ability to use it, is forcing us towards centralized analytics. EOS This splintered concentration of data further consolidates analytical capabilities in the hands of the few and divides the network into the analysors and the analysed. EOS The fracturing of the system into opaque datastores and analytics blocks creates a strong positive feedback loop and has a significant negative impact on the stability, transparency and freedom of the network.	This paper attempted to identify problems associated with the internet, internet dependent business models and reviewing available solutions and discuss possible solutions which became necessary.

doc	On Adaptive Estimation for Dynamic Bernoulli Bandits EOS The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is a classic example of the exploration-exploitation dilemma. EOS It is concerned with maximising the total rewards for a gambler by sequentially pulling an arm from a multi-armed slot machine where each arm is associated with a reward distribution. EOS In static MABs, the reward distributions do not change over time, while in dynamic MABs, each arm's reward distribution can change, and the optimal arm can switch over time. EOS Motivated by many real applications where rewards are binary, we focus on dynamic Bernoulli bandits. EOS Standard methods like _EQN_ -Greedy and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), which rely on the sample mean estimator, often fail to track changes in the underlying reward for dynamic problems.	In this paper, we overcome the shortcoming of slow response to change by deploying adaptive estimation in the standard methods and propose a new family of algorithms, which are adaptive versions of _EQN_ -Greedy, UCB, and Thompson sampling.
doc	A singularly perturbed nonlinear traction problem in a periodically perforated domain. A functional analytic approach EOS We consider a periodically perforated domain obtained by making in R^n a periodic set of holes, each of them of size proportional to \epsilon. EOS Then we introduce a nonlinear boundary value problem for the Lam\'e equations in such a periodically perforated domain. EOS The unknown of the problem is a vector valued function u which represents the displacement attained in the equilibrium configuration by the points of a periodic linearly elastic matrix with a hole of size \epsilon contained in each periodic cell.	We assume that the traction exerted by the matrix on the boundary of each hole depends (nonlinearly) on the displacement attained by the points of the boundary of the hole.

doc	Dynamical Functional Theory for Compressed Sensing EOS We introduce a theoretical approach for designing generalizations of the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for compressed sensing which are valid for large observation matrices that are drawn from an invariant random matrix ensemble. EOS By design, the fixed points of the algorithm obey the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations corresponding to the ensemble. EOS Using a dynamical functional approach we are able to derive an effective stochastic process for the marginal statistics of a single component of the dynamics.	This allows us to design memory terms in the algorithm in such a way that the resulting fields become Gaussian random variables allowing for an explicit analysis.

doc	Before the Page time: maximum entanglements or the return of the monster? EOS The entropy of Hawking radiation is approximately equal to the maximum of entanglement entropy if a black hole is in a state before the Page time, i.e., when the entropy of Hawking radiation is smaller than the entropy of the black hole. EOS However, if there exists a process generating smaller entanglements rather than maximal entanglements, the entropy of Hawking radiation will become smaller than the maximum of the entanglement entropy before the Page time. EOS If this process accumulates, even though the probability is small, the emitted radiation can eventually be distinguished from the exactly thermal state. EOS In this paper, we provide several interpretations of this phenomenon: (1) information of the collapsed matter is emitted before the Page time, (2) there exists a firewall or a non-local effect before the Page time, or (3) the statistical entropy is greater than the areal entropy;	a monster is formed.

EOS In this paper, we evaluate the impact on the Internet latency caused by the increased amount of human activities that are carried out on-line.	The study focuses on Italy, which experienced significant restrictions imposed by local authorities, but results about Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the whole of Europe are also included.
doc	Entropy of real rational surface automorphisms EOS We compare real and complex dynamics for automorphisms of rational surfaces that are obtained by lifting \chg some quadratic birational maps of the plane. EOS In particular, we show how to exploit the existence of an invariant cubic curve to understand how the real part of an automorphism acts on homology.	We apply this understanding to give examples where the entropy of the full (complex) automorphism is the same as its real restriction.
doc	Buffer-aware Worst Case Timing Analysis of Wormhole Network On Chip EOS A buffer-aware worst-case timing analysis of wormhole NoC is proposed in this paper to integrate the impact of buffer size on the different dependencies relationship between flows, i.e. EOS direct and indirect blocking flows, and consequently the timing performance. EOS First, more accurate definitions of direct and indirect blocking flows sets have been introduced to take into account the buffer size impact. EOS Then, the modeling and worst-case timing analysis of wormhole NoC have been detailed, based on Network Calculus formalism and the newly defined blocking flows sets.	This introduced approach has been illustrated in the case of a realistic NoC case study to show the trade off between latency and buffer size.
doc	RE J1034+396: The origin of the soft X-ray excess and QPO EOS The X-ray quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) seen in RE J1034+396 is so far unique amongst AGN. EOS Here we look at the another unique feature of RE J1034+396, namely its huge soft X-ray excess, to see if this is related in any way to the detection of the QPO. EOS We show that all potential models considered for the soft energy excess can fit the 0.3-10 keV X-ray spectrum, but that the energy dependence of the rapid variability (which is dominated by the QPO) strongly supports a spectral decomposition where the soft excess is from low temperature Comptonization of the disc emission and remains mostly constant, while the rapid variability is produced by the power law tail changing in normalization. EOS The presence of the QPO in the tail rather than in the disc is a common feature in black hole binaries, but low temperature Comptonization of the disc spectrum is not generally seen in these systems. EOS The main exception to this is GRS 1915+105, the only black hole binary which routinely shows super-Eddington luminosities.	We speculate that super-Eddington accretion rates lead to a change in disc structure, and that this also triggers the X-ray QPO.

doc	sigma and kappa in Scattering Processes and New pi0 pi0 Phase Shift Data EOS The evidences for sigma(600) and kappa(900) observed in our analyses on the pi pi and K pi scattering phase shift data are described, briefly. EOS The analysis have been performed by the interfering amplitude method, which satisfies the unitarity requirement, using physically meaningful parameters. EOS The introduction of the negative phase shifts (repulsive force) are essential in the analysis. EOS New data for the pi0 pi0 scattering amplitudes and the I=0 S wave phase shifts are presented. EOS The data have been obtained in the pi-p charge exchange reaction, pi- p --> pi0 pi0 n at 9 GeV by the E135 experiment at the KEK PS.	The amplitude analysis are performed.

doc	Physical Characterisation of Interstellar Comet 2I/2019 Q4 (Borisov) EOS We present a study of interstellar comet 2I/2019 Q4 (Borisov) using both preperihelion and postperihelion observations spanning late September 2019 through late January 2020. EOS The intrinsic brightness of the comet was observed to continuously decline throughout the timespan, likely due to the decreasing effective scattering cross-section as a result of volatile sublimation with a slope of _EQN_ km _EQN_ d _EQN_. EOS We witnessed no significant change in the slightly reddish colour of the comet, with mean values of _EQN_, _EQN_, and the normalised reflectivity gradient across the _EQN_ and _EQN_ bands _EQN_ % per _EQN_ \AA, all unremarkable in the context of solar system comets. EOS Using the available astrometric observations, we confidently detect the nongravitational acceleration of the comet following a shallow heliocentric distance dependency of _EQN_.	Accordingly, we estimate that the nucleus is most likely _EQN_ 0.4 km in radius, and that a fraction of _EQN_ 0.2% of the total nucleus in mass has been eroded due to the sublimation activity since the earliest observation of the comet in 2018 December by the time of perihelion.
doc	Spintronics and Pseudospintronics in Graphene and Topological Insulators EOS The two-dimensional electron systems in graphene and in topological insulators are described by massless Dirac equations. EOS Although the two systems have similar Hamiltonians, they are polar opposites in terms of spin-orbit coupling strength. EOS We briefly review the status of efforts to achieve long spin relaxation times in graphene with its weak spin-orbit coupling, and to achieve large current-induced spin polarizations in topological-insulator surface states that have strong spin-orbit coupling.	We also comment on differences between the magnetic responses and dilute-moment coupling properties of the two systems, and on the pseudospin analog of giant magnetoresistance in bilayer graphene.
doc	Chromatic Microlensing Time Delays EOS Due to the finite size of the disk and the temperature fluctuations producing the variability, microlensing changes the actual time delays between images of strongly lensed AGN on the _EQN_ day(s) light-crossing time scale of the emission region.	This microlensing-induced time delay depends on the disk model, primarily the disk size _EQN_ which has been found to be larger than predicted by the thin-disk model.
doc	Discovery of a pre-existing molecular filament associated with supernova remnant G127.1+0.5 EOS We performed millimeter observations in CO lines toward the supernova remnant (SNR) G127.1+0.5. EOS We found a molecular filament at 4--13 km s _EQN_ consisting of two distinct parts: a straight part coming out of the remnant region and a curved part in the remnant region. EOS The curved part is coincides well with the bright SNR shell detected in 1420 MHz radio continuum and mid-infrared observations in the northeastern region. EOS In addition, redshifted line wing broadening is found only in the curved part of the molecular filament, which indicates a physical interaction.	These provide strong evidences, for the first time, to confirm the association between an SNR and a pre-existing long molecular filament.
doc	A new detailed examination of white dwarfs in NGC3532 and NGC2287 EOS We present the results of a photometric and spectroscopic study of the white dwarf candidate members of the intermediate age open clusters NGC3532 and NGC2287. EOS Of the nine objects investigated, it is determined that six are probable members of the clusters, four in NGC3532 and two in NGC2287.	For these six white dwarfs we use our estimates of their cooling times together with the cluster ages to constrain the lifetimes and masses of their progenitor stars.
doc	Radiative Generation of the LMA Solution from Small Solar Neutrino Mixing at the GUT Scale EOS We show that in see-saw models with small or even vanishing lepton mixing angle _EQN_, maximal _EQN_, zero _EQN_ and zero CP phases at the GUT scale, the currently favored LMA solution of the solar neutrino problem can be obtained in a rather natural way by Renormalization Group effects. EOS We find that most of the running takes place in the energy ranges above and between the see-saw scales, unless the charged lepton Yukawa couplings are large, which would correspond to a large _EQN_ in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). EOS The Renormalization Group evolution of the solar mixing angle _EQN_ is generically larger than the evolution of _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS A large enhancement occurs for an inverted mass hierarchy and for a regular mass hierarchy with _EQN_.	We present numerical examples of the evolution of the lepton mixing angles in the Standard Model and the MSSM, in which the current best-fit values of the LMA mixing angles are produced with vanishing solar mixing angle _EQN_ at the GUT scale.
doc	On the nature of some SGRs and AXPs as rotation-powered neutron stars EOS We investigate the possibility that some SGRs/AXPs could be canonical rotation-powered pulsars using realistic NS structure parameters instead of fiducial values.	We show that realistic NS parameters lowers the estimated value of the magnetic field and radiation efficiency, _EQN_, with respect to estimates based on fiducial NS parameters.
doc	Learning to Branch for Multi-Task Learning EOS Training multiple tasks jointly in one deep network yields reduced latency during inference and better performance over the single-task counterpart by sharing certain layers of a network. EOS However, over-sharing a network could erroneously enforce over-generalization, causing negative knowledge transfer across tasks. EOS Prior works rely on human intuition or pre-computed task relatedness scores for ad hoc branching structures. EOS They provide sub-optimal end results and often require huge efforts for the trial-and-error process. EOS In this work, we present an automated multi-task learning algorithm that learns where to share or branch within a network, designing an effective network topology that is directly optimized for multiple objectives across tasks.	Specifically, we propose a novel tree-structured design space that casts a tree branching operation as a gumbel-softmax sampling procedure.
doc	Deep Spatial-angular Regularization for Compressive Light Field Reconstruction over Coded Apertures EOS Coded aperture is a promising approach for capturing the 4-D light field (LF), in which the 4-D data are compressively modulated into 2-D coded measurements that are further decoded by reconstruction algorithms. EOS The bottleneck lies in the reconstruction algorithms, resulting in rather limited reconstruction quality. EOS To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework for the reconstruction of high-quality LFs from acquisitions via learned coded apertures.	The proposed method incorporates the measurement observation into the deep learning framework elegantly to avoid relying entirely on data-driven priors for LF reconstruction.
doc	Momentum-space calculation of _EQN_ He triatomic system with realistic potential EOS The system of three _EQN_ atoms with realistic interactions is studied in the momentum-space framework. EOS It is demonstrated that short and long-range difficulties encountered in the coordinate-space calculations can be reliably resolved in the momentum-space calculations. EOS Well-converged and accurate results are obtained for the ground and excited trimer energies, atom-dimer scattering length, phase shifts, inelasticity parameters, and elastic and breakup cross sections.	A significant correction to previously published results is found for the elastic cross section at very low energy.
doc	Early supersymmetric cold dark matter substructure EOS Earth-mass ``microhalos'' may be the first objects to virialize in the early universe. EOS Their ability to survive the hierarchical clustering process as substructure in the larger halos that form subsequently has implications for dark matter detection experiments. EOS We present a large N-body simulation of early substructure in a supersymmetric cold dark matter (SUSY-CDM) scenario characterized by an exponential cutoff in the power spectrum at M_c=10^-6 Msun. EOS The simulation resolves a 0.014 Msun parent ``SUSY'' halo at z=75 with 14 million particles.	On these scales the effective index of the power spectrum approaches -3, and a range of mass scales collapse almost simultaneously.

doc	The DiskMass Survey. VI. Gas and stellar kinematics in spiral galaxies from PPak integral-field spectroscopy EOS We present ionized-gas (OIII) and stellar kinematics (velocities and velocity dispersions) for 30 nearly face-on spiral galaxies out to as much as three disk scale lengths (h_R). EOS These data have been derived from PPak IFU spectroscopy (4980-5370A), observed at a mean resolution of R=7700 (sigma_inst=17km/s). EOS These data are a fundamental product of our survey and will be used in companion papers to, e.g., derive the detailed (baryonic+dark) mass budget of each galaxy in our sample. EOS Our presentation provides a comprehensive description of the observing strategy, data reduction, and analysis. EOS Along with a clear presentation of the data, we demonstrate: (1) The OIII and stellar rotation curves exhibit a clear signature of asymmetric drift with a rotation difference that is 11% of the maximum rotation speed of the galaxy disk, comparable to measurements in the solar neighborhood in the Milky Way. EOS (2) The e-folding length of the stellar velocity dispersion is two times h_R on average, as expected for a disk with a constant scale height and mass-to-light ratio, with a scatter that is notably smaller for massive, high-surface-brightness disks in the most luminous galaxies.	(3) At radii larger than 1.5 h_R, the stellar velocity dispersion tends to decline slower than the best-fitting exponential function, which may be due to an increase in the disk mass-to-light ratio, disk flaring, or disk heating by the dark-matter halo.
doc	A Survey: Various Techniques of Image Compression EOS This paper addresses about various image compression techniques. EOS On the basis of analyzing the various image compression techniques this paper presents a survey of existing research papers. EOS In this paper we analyze different types of existing method of image compression. EOS Compression of an image is significantly different then compression of binary raw data. EOS To solve these use different types of techniques for image compression. EOS Now there is question may be arise that how to image compress and which types of technique is used. EOS For this purpose there are basically two types are method are introduced namely lossless and lossy image compression techniques. EOS In present time some other techniques are added with basic method.	In some area neural network genetic algorithms are used for image compression.
doc	The geometrical origin of the strain-twist coupling in double helices EOS The geometrical coupling between strain and twist in double helices is investigated. EOS Overwinding, where strain leads to further winding, is shown to be a universal property for helices, which are stretched along their longitudinal axis when the initial pitch angle is below the zero-twist angle (39.4 deg). EOS Unwinding occurs at larger pitch angles.	The zero-twist angle is the unique pitch angle at the point between overwinding and unwinding, and it is independent of the mechanical properties of the double helix.
doc	INTEGRAL observations of the X-ray burster 4U1850-087: first detection of hard X-ray emission extending above 50keV EOS The X-ray burster 4U1850-087, located in the globular cluster NGC6712, is an ultracompact binary likely harbouring a degenerate companion.The source has been observed with INTEGRAL several times, during the monitoring of the Galactic plane, with an unprecedented exposure time. EOS The broad-band spectrum (2-100 keV; EOS INTEGRAL together with a quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton observation) is well described with a disk-blackbody emission (kTin=0.8keV) together with a power-law (photon index of 2).	We report here the first detection of hard X-ray emission from this source above 50 keV.
doc	_EQN_ -block parallel addition versus _EQN_ -block parallel addition in non-standard numeration systems EOS Parallel addition in integer base is used for speeding up multiplication and division algorithms. EOS _EQN_ -block parallel addition has been introduced by Kornerup in 1999: instead of manipulating single digits, one works with blocks of fixed length _EQN_. EOS The aim of this paper is to investigate how such notion influences the relationship between the base and the cardinality of the alphabet allowing parallel addition. EOS In this paper, we mainly focus on a certain class of real bases --- the so-called Parry numbers. EOS We give lower bounds on the cardinality of alphabets of non-negative integer digits allowing block parallel addition.	By considering quadratic Pisot bases, we are able to show that these bounds cannot be improved in general and we give explicit parallel algorithms for addition in these cases.

The sensitivity of the form factors to the _EQN_ quark mass has meant significant systematic uncertainties in lattice QCD calculations at unphysically heavy pion masses.

doc	Common Origin of 3.55 keV X-Ray Line and Galactic Center Gamma Ray Excess in a Radiative Neutrino Mass Model EOS We attempt to simultaneously explain the recently observed 3.55 keV X-ray line in the analysis of XMM-Newton telescope data and the galactic center gamma ray excess observed by the Fermi gamma ray space telescope within an abelian gauge extension of standard model. EOS We consider a two component dark matter scenario with tree level mass difference 3.55 keV such that the heavier one can decay into the lighter one and a photon with energy 3.55 keV. EOS The lighter dark matter candidate is protected from decaying into the standard model particles by a remnant _EQN_ symmetry into which the abelian gauge symmetry gets spontaneously broken. EOS If the mass of the dark matter particle is chosen to be within _EQN_ GeV, then this model can also explain the galactic center gamma ray excess if the dark matter annihilation into _EQN_ pairs has a cross section of _EQN_. EOS We constrain the model from the requirement of producing correct dark matter relic density, 3.55 keV X-ray line flux and galactic center gamma ray excess.	We also impose the bounds coming from dark matter direct detection experiments as well as collider limits on additional gauge boson mass and gauge coupling.
doc	Generalized Linear Models for Longitudinal Data with Biased Sampling Designs: A Sequential Offsetted Regressions Approach EOS Biased sampling designs can be highly efficient when studying rare (binary) or low variability (continuous) endpoints. EOS We consider longitudinal data settings in which the probability of being sampled depends on a repeatedly measured response through an outcome-related, auxiliary variable. EOS Such auxiliary variable- or outcome-dependent sampling improves observed response and possibly exposure variability over random sampling, even though the auxiliary variable is not of scientific interest. EOS For analysis, we propose a generalized linear model based approach using a sequence of two offsetted regressions.	The first estimates the relationship of the auxiliary variable to response and covariate data using an offsetted logistic regression model.

EOS At the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI), Switzerland, and at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), U.S.A., it is planned to use solid deuterium (SD_2) for the UCN production from cold neutrons.	The philosophies about how the cold neutrons are obtained are quite different, though.

doc	Measuring Baryon Acoustic Oscillations on 21 cm intensity fluctuations at moderate redshifts EOS After reionization, emission in the 21 cm hyperfine transition provides a direct probe of neutral hydrogen distributed in galaxies. EOS Different from galaxy redshift surveys, observation of baryon acoustic oscillations in the cumulative 21 cm emission may offer an attractive method for constraining dark energy properties at moderate redshifts. EOS Keys to this program are techniques to extract the faint cosmological signal from various contaminants, such as detector noise and continuum foregrounds.	In this paper, we investigate the possible systematic and statistical errors in the acoustic scale estimates using ground-based radio interferometers.

EOS We resolve the X-ray emission from the co-located ASCA source into a compact object surrounded by structured diffuse emission that fills the interior of the radio shell. EOS The morphology of the diffuse emission strongly resembles that of a pulsar wind nebula.	The spectrum of the compact source is well-characterized by a power-law with index approx.

EOS Stellar masses, stellar velocity dispersions and structural parameters such as sizes and surface mass densities are also available for these objects. EOS In order to correct the aperture mismatch between SDSS and 2MASS, we correct the SDSS magnitudes to the isophotal circular radius where the 2MASS magnitudes are measured.	We compare the correlations between optical, optical-infrared and infrared colours and galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, velocity dispersion and surface mass density.
doc	The Bulk-to-Boundary Propagator in Black Hole Microstate Backgrounds EOS First-quantized propagation in quantum gravitational AdS _EQN_ backgrounds can be exactly reconstructed using CFT _EQN_ data and Virasoro symmetry. EOS We develop methods to compute the bulk-to-boundary propagator in a black hole microstate, _EQN_, at finite central charge.	As a first application, we show that the semiclassical theory on the Euclidean BTZ solution sharply disagrees with the exact description, as expected based on the resolution of forbidden thermal singularities, though this effect may appear exponentially small for physical observers.

EOS We investigate whether the UHECRs exhibit the anisotropy signal expected if the primary particles are protons that originate in galaxies in the local universe, or in sources correlated with these galaxies. EOS We cross-correlate the UHECR arrival directions with the positions of IRAS-PSCz and 2MASS-6dF galaxies taking into account particle energy losses during propagation.	This is the first time that the 6dF survey is used in a search for the sources of UHECRs and the first time that the PSCz survey is used with the full 69 PAO events.

EOS The integrated intensity map of the 12CO (J=2-1) transition has shown a structure with a compact core and a compact ridge extended in the north-west of the core. EOS The cloud is surrounded by an optically bright rim, where the radiation-driven implosion (RDI) may greatly change the gas properties.	The intensities of the CO (J=3-2) transition are higher than those of the CO (J=2-1) transition along the rim area.We find characteristic RDI structure in positionvelocity diagrams.

For the same number of produced particles, because the number of participants differs, in the wounded nucleon model the transverse momentum of hadrons can differ between p+p and p+A collisions.
doc	A Unified Approximation Framework for Compressing and Accelerating Deep Neural Networks EOS Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in a variety of real world applications, i.e., image classification.

EOS To address this issue, various approximation techniques have been investigated, which seek for a light weighted network with little performance degradation in exchange of smaller model size or faster inference.	Both low-rankness and sparsity are appealing properties for the network approximation.

EOS However, whether these prior techniques, applied traditionally to image-based models, work with the same efficacy to the sequential decision making process in reinforcement learning remains an unanswered question.	To address this void, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study that quantifies the effects of quantization on various deep reinforcement learning policies with the intent to reduce their computational resource demands.

doc	Towards a Scalable and Flexible Simulation and Testing Environment Toolbox for Intelligent Microgrid Control EOS Micro- and smart grids (MSG) play an important role both for integrating renewable energy sources in conventional electricity grids and for providing power supply in remote areas. EOS Modern MSGs are largely driven by power electronic converters due to their high efficiency and flexibility. EOS Nevertheless, controlling MSGs is a challenging task due to highest requirements on energy availability, safety and voltage quality within a wide range of different MSG topologies. EOS This results in a high demand for comprehensive testing of new control concepts during their development phase and comparisons with the state of the art in order to ensure their feasibility. EOS This applies in particular to data-driven control approaches from the field of reinforcement learning (RL), whose stability and operating behavior can hardly be evaluated a priori. EOS Therefore, the OpenModelica Microgrid Gym (OMG) package, an open-source software toolbox for the simulation and control optimization of MSGs, is proposed.	It is capable of modeling and simulating arbitrary MSG topologies and offers a Python-based interface for plug \& play controller testing.

EOS The merger system is comprised of the subclusters A3376W & A3376E. EOS Based on new deep multi-wavelength large-field images and published redshifts, we bring new insights about the history of this merger. EOS Despite the difficulty of applying the weak lensing technique at such low redshift, we successfully recovered the mass distribution in the cluster field. EOS Moreover, with the application of a two-body model, we have addressed the dynamics of these merging system. EOS We have found the individual masses of M_ 200 ^ W =3.0_ -1.7 ^ +1.3 x10^ 14 M_ \odot and M_ 200 ^ E =0.9_ -0.8 ^ +0.5 x10^ 14 M_ \odot. EOS The cometary shaped X-ray distribution shows only one peak spatially coincident with both Eastern BCG and the A3376E mass peak whereas the gas content of A3376W seems to be stripped out. EOS Our data allowed us to confirm the existence of a third subcluster located at the North, 1147+-62 kpc apart from the neighbour subcluster A3376E and having a mass M_ 200 ^ N =1.4_ -1.0 ^ +0.7 x10^ 14 M_ \odot.	From our dynamical analysis, we found the merging is taking place very close to the plane of the sky, with the merger axis just 10 deg +-11 deg from it.

EOS One is a 2 kg 76Ge IGEX detector (RG-2) which has an energy threshold of 4 keV and a low-energy background rate of about 0.3 c/keV/kg/day.	The other is a small (234 g) natural abundance Ge detector (COSME), of low energy threshold (2.5 keV) and an energy resolution of 0.4 keV at 10 keV which is looking for WIMPs and for solar axions.

doc	An attempted replication of Hackl, Koster-Hale, Varvoutis (2012) EOS Hackl, Koster-Hale & Varvoutis (2012; EOS Journal of Semantics, 29, 145-206; EOS HKV) provide data that suggested that in a null context, antecedent-contained-deletion (ACD) relative clause structures modifying a quantified object noun phrase are easier to process than those modifying a definite object NP. EOS HKV argue that this pattern of results supports a quantifier-raising (QR) analysis of both ACD structures and quantified NPs in object position: under the account that they advocate, both ACD resolution and quantified NPs in object position require movement of the object NP to a higher syntactic position. EOS The processing advantage for quantified object NPs in ACD is hypothesized to derive from the fact that - at the point where ACD resolution must take place - the quantified NP has already undergone QR whereas this is not the case for definite NPs.	Here, we report attempted replications of their self-paced reading Experiments 1 and 2.
doc	Are large distance Heegaard splittings generic? EOS In a previous paper we introduced a notion of "genericity" for countable sets of curves in the curve complex of a surface S, based on the Lebesgue measure on the space of projective measured laminations in S.	With this definition we prove that for each fixed g > 1 the set of irreducible genus g Heegaard splittings of high distance is generic, in the set of all irreducible Heegaard splittings.
doc	Refit to numerically problematic UMIST reaction rate coefficients EOS Aims. EOS Chemical databases such as the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry (UDFA) are indispensable in the numerical modeling of astrochemical networks. EOS Several of the listed reactions in the UDFA have properties that are problematic in numerical computations: Some are parametrized in a way that leads to extremely divergent behavior for low kinetic temperatures. EOS Other reactions possess multiple entries that are each valid in a different temperature regime, but have no smooth transition when switching from one to another. EOS Numerically, this introduces many difficulties.We present corrected parametrizations for these sets of reactions in the UDFA06 database. EOS Methods.	From the tabulated parametrization in UDFA, we created artificial data points and used a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to find a set of improved fit parameters without divergent behavior for low temperatures.
doc	The number of connected components of links associated with the Thompson group EOS A few years ago Vaughan Jones devised a method to construct knots and links from elements of the Thompson groups.

doc	Angle-resolved effective potentials for disk-shaped molecules EOS We present an approach for calculating coarse-grained angle-resolved effective pair potentials for uniaxial molecules. EOS For integrating out the intramolecular degrees of freedom we apply umbrella sampling and steered dynamics techniques in atomistically-resolved molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. EOS Throughout this study we focus on disk-like molecules such as coronene. EOS To develop the methods we focus on integrating out the van-der-Waals and intramolecular interactions, while electrostatic charge contributions are neglected. EOS The resulting coarse-grained pair potential reveals a strong temperature and angle dependence. EOS In the next step we fit the numerical data with various Gay-Berne-like potentials to be used in more efficient simulations on larger scales.	The quality of the resulting coarse-grained results is evaluated by comparing their pair and many-body structure as well as some thermodynamic quantities self-consistently to the outcome of atomistic MD simulations of many-particle systems.

doc	Column density distribution and cosmological mass density of neutral gas: Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III Data Release 9 EOS We present the first results from an ongoing survey for Damped Lyman-alpha systems (DLAs) in the spectra of z>2 quasars observed in the course of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) III. EOS Our full (non-statistical) sample, based on Data Release 9, comprises 12,081 systems with log N(HI)>=20, out of which 6,839 have log N(HI)>=20.3. EOS This is the largest DLA sample ever compiled, superseding that from SDSS-II by a factor of seven.	Using a statistical sub-sample and estimating systematics from realistic mock data, we probe the N(HI) distribution at <z> = 2.5.
doc	A Quantitative Understanding of Pattern Matching EOS This paper shows that the recent approach to quantitative typing systems for programming languages can be extended to pattern matching features. EOS Indeed, we define two resource aware type systems, named U and E, for a lambda-calculus equipped with pairs for both patterns and terms. EOS Our typing systems borrow some basic ideas from [BKRDR15], which characterises (head) normalisation in a qualitative way, in the sense that typability and normalisation coincide. EOS But in contrast to [BKRDR15], our (static) systems also provides quantitative information about the dynamics of the calculus. EOS Indeed, system U provides upper bounds for the length of normalisation sequences plus the size of their corresponding normal forms, while system E, which can be seen as a refinement of system U, produces exact bounds for each of them. EOS This is achieved by means of a non-idempotent intersection type system equipped with different technical tools. EOS First of all, we use product types to type pairs, instead of the disjoint unions in [BKRDR15], thus avoiding an overlap between "being a pair" and "being duplicable", resulting in an essential tool to reason about quantitativity. EOS Secondly, typing sequents in system E are decorated with tuples of integers, which provide quantitative information about normalisation sequences, notably time (c.f.	length) and space (c.f.
doc	Can we reach Pareto optimal outcomes using bottom-up approaches? EOS Traditionally, researchers in decision making have focused on attempting to reach Pareto Optimality using horizontal approaches, where optimality is calculated taking into account every participant at the same time.	Sometimes, this may prove to be a difficult task (e.g., conflict, mistrust, no information sharing, etc.).
doc	Cut elimination, identity elimination, and interpolation in super-Belnap logics EOS We develop a Gentzen-style proof theory for super-Belnap logics (extensions of the four-valued Dunn-Belnap logic), expanding on an approach initiated by Pynko. EOS We show that just like substructural logics may be understood proof-theoretically as logics which relax the structural rules of classical logic but keep its logical rules as well as the rules of Identity and Cut, super-Belnap logics may be seen as logics which relax Identity and Cut but keep the logical rules as well as the structural rules of classical logic.	A generalization of the cut elimination theorem for classical propositional logic is then proved and used to establish interpolation for various super-Belnap logics.
doc	Refinement Reflection: Complete Verification with SMT EOS We introduce Refinement Reflection, a new framework for building SMT-based deductive verifiers. EOS The key idea is to reflect the code implementing a user-defined function into the function's (output) refinement type.	As a consequence, at uses of the function, the function definition is instantiated in the SMT logic in a precise fashion that permits decidable verification.
doc	Gribov horizon and BRST symmetry: a few remarks EOS The issue of the BRST symmetry in presence of the Gribov horizon is addressed in Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge. EOS The positivity of the Faddeev-Popov operator within the Gribov region enables us to convert the soft breaking of the BRST invariance exhibited by the Gribov-Zwanziger action into a non-local exact symmetry, displaying explicit dependence from the non-perturbative Gribov parameter.	Despite its non-locality, this symmetry turns out to be useful in order to establish non-perturbative Ward identities, allowing us to evaluate the vacuum expectation value of quantities which are BRST exact.
doc	Stable wrinkling in voltage and charge controlled dielectric membranes EOS Thin dielectric elastomers with compliant electrodes exhibit various types of instability under the action of electromechanical loading. EOS Guided by the thermodynamically-based formulation of Fosdick and Tang (J. EOS Elasticity 88, 255-297, 2007), here we provide an energetic perspective on the stability of dielectric elastomers and we highlight the fundamental energetic divide between voltage control and charge control.	By using the concept of energy relaxation, we describe wrinkling for neo-Hookean ideal elastomers, and we show that in voltage control wrinkling is stable as long as the tension-extension inequality holds, whereas wrinkling is always stable in charge control.
doc	Carbon Abundances of Three Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars from High-Resolution Gemini-S/bHROS Spectra of the 8727A [C I] Line EOS We present the results from an analysis of the 8727ang forbidden [C I] line in high-resolution Gemini-S/bHROS spectra of three CEMP stars. EOS We find the [C/Fe] ratios based on the [C I] abundances of the two most Fe-rich stars in our sample (HIP 0507-1653: [Fe/H] = -1.42 and HIP 0054-2542: [Fe/H] = -2.66) to be in good agreement with previously determined CH and C_2 line-based values. EOS For the most Fe-deficient star in our sample (HIP 1005-1439: [Fe/H] = -3.08), however, the [C/Fe] ratio is found to be 0.34 dex lower than the published molecular-based value. EOS We have carried out 3D local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) calculations for [C I], and the resulting corrections are found to be modest for all three stars, suggesting that the discrepancy between the [C I] and molecular-based C abundances of HIP 1005-1439 is due to more severe 3D effects on the molecular lines. EOS Carbon abundances are also derived from C I high-excitation lines and are found to be 0.45-0.64 dex higher than the [C I]-based abundances. EOS Previously published non-LTE C I abundance corrections bring the [C I] and C I abundances into better agreement;	however, targeted NLTE calculations for CEMP stars are clearly needed.
doc	Point transitivity, _EQN_ -transitivity and multi-minimality EOS Let _EQN_ be a topological dynamical system and _EQN_ be a Furstenberg family (a collection of subsets of _EQN_ with hereditary upward property). EOS A point _EQN_ is called an _EQN_ -transitive point if for every non-empty open subset _EQN_ of _EQN_ the entering time set of _EQN_ into _EQN_, _EQN_, is in _EQN_ ; EOS the system _EQN_ is called _EQN_ -point transitive if there exists some _EQN_ -transitive point. EOS In this paper, we first discuss the connection between _EQN_ -point transitivity and _EQN_ -transitivity, and show that weakly mixing and strongly mixing systems can be characterized by _EQN_ -point transitivity, completing results in [Transitive points via Furstenberg family, Topology Appl. EOS 158 (2011), 2221--2231]. EOS We also show that multi-transitivity, _EQN_ -transitivity and multi-minimality can also be characterized by _EQN_ -point transitivity, answering two questions proposed by Kwietniak and Oprocha [On weak mixing, minimality and weak disjointness of all iterates, Erg. EOS Th. EOS Dynam.	Syst., 32 (2012), 1661--1672].
doc	Ordered Landmarks in Planning EOS Many known planning tasks have inherent constraints concerning the best order in which to achieve the goals. EOS A number of research efforts have been made to detect such constraints and to use them for guiding search, in the hope of speeding up the planning process. EOS We go beyond the previous approaches by considering ordering constraints not only over the (top-level) goals, but also over the sub-goals that will necessarily arise during planning.	Landmarks are facts that must be true at some point in every valid solution plan.
doc	Exact ground-state correlation functions of an atomic-molecular boson conversion model EOS We study the ground-state properties of an atomic-molecular boson conversion model through an exact Bethe Ansatz solution. EOS For a certain range of parameter choices, we prove that the ground-state Bethe roots lie on the positive real-axis. EOS We then use a continuum limit approach to obtain a singular integral equation characterising the distribution of these Bethe roots. EOS Solving this equation leads to an analytic expression for the ground-state energy. EOS The form of the expression is consistent with the existence of a line of quantum phase transitions, which has been identified in earlier studies.	This line demarcates a molecular phase from a mixed phase.

EOS A key ingredient was information about certain Kronecker coefficients.	While tensors are an interesting test bed for GCT ideas, the far-away goal is the separation of algebraic complexity classes.

doc	Instruments on large optical telescopes -- A case study EOS In the distant past, telescopes were known, first and foremost, for the sizes of their apertures. EOS Advances in technology are now enabling astronomers to build extremely powerful instruments to the extent that instruments have now achieved importance comparable or even exceeding the usual importance accorded to the apertures of the telescopes. EOS However, the cost of successive generations of instruments has risen at a rate noticeably above that of the rate of inflation. EOS Here, given the vast sums of money now being expended on optical telescopes and their instrumentation, I argue that astronomers must undertake "cost-benefit" analysis for future planning. EOS I use the scientific output of the first two decades of the W. EOS M.	Keck Observatory as a laboratory for this purpose.
doc	Analyzing establishment nonresponse using an interpretable regression tree model with linked administrative data EOS To gain insight into how characteristics of an establishment are associated with nonresponse, a recursive partitioning algorithm is applied to the Occupational Employment Statistics May 2006 survey data to build a regression tree. EOS The tree models an establishment's propensity to respond to the survey given certain establishment characteristics. EOS It provides mutually exclusive cells based on the characteristics with homogeneous response propensities. EOS This makes it easy to identify interpretable associations between the characteristic variables and an establishment's propensity to respond, something not easily done using a logistic regression propensity model. EOS We test the model obtained using the May data against data from the November 2006 Occupational Employment Statistics survey.	Testing the model on a disjoint set of establishment data with a very large sample size _EQN_ offers evidence that the regression tree model accurately describes the association between the establishment characteristics and the response propensity for the OES survey.
doc	A note on q-Gaussians and non-Gaussians in statistical mechanics EOS The sum of _EQN_ sufficiently strongly correlated random variables will not in general be Gaussian distributed in the limit N\to\infty. EOS We revisit examples of sums x that have recently been put forward as instances of variables obeying a q-Gaussian law, that is, one of type (cst)\times[1-(1-q)x^2]^ 1/(1-q).	We show by explicit calculation that the probability distributions in the examples are actually analytically different from q-Gaussians, in spite of numerically resembling them very closely.

doc	A New 1.4GHz Radio Continuum Map of the Sky South of Declination +25 deg EOS Archival data from the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) and the HI Zone of Avoidance (HIZOA) survey have been carefully reprocessed into a new 1.4GHz continuum map of the sky south of declination +25 deg. EOS The wide sky coverage, high sensitivity of 40mK (limited by confusion), resolution of 14'.4 (compared to 51' for the Haslam et al 408MHz and 35' for the Reich et al 1.4GHz surveys), and low level of artefacts makes this map ideal for numerous studies, including: merging into interferometer maps to complete large-scale structures; EOS decomposition of thermal and non-thermal emission components from Galactic and extragalactic sources; EOS and comparison of emission regions with other frequencies.	The new map is available for download.
doc	Hamilton-Jacobi Theory for Degenerate Lagrangian Systems with Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints EOS We extend Hamilton-Jacobi theory to Lagrange-Dirac (or implicit Lagrangian) systems, a generalized formulation of Lagrangian mechanics that can incorporate degenerate Lagrangians as well as holonomic and nonholonomic constraints.	We refer to the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation as the Dirac-Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
doc	Blind decomposition of Herschel-HIFI spectral maps of the NGC 7023 nebula EOS Large spatial-spectral surveys are more and more common in astronomy. EOS This calls for the need of new methods to analyze such mega- to giga-pixel data-cubes. EOS In this paper we present a method to decompose such observations into a limited and comprehensive set of components. EOS The original data can then be interpreted in terms of linear combinations of these components. EOS The method uses non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to extract latent spectral end-members in the data. EOS The number of needed end-members is estimated based on the level of noise in the data. EOS A Monte-Carlo scheme is adopted to estimate the optimal end-members, and their standard deviations.	Finally, the maps of linear coefficients are reconstructed using non-negative least squares.
doc	The Morphology-Density relationship in 1<z<2 clusters EOS The morphology-density relationship states that dense cosmic environments such as galaxy clusters have an overabundance of quiescent elliptical galaxies, but it is unclear at which redshift this relationship is first established. EOS We study the morphology of 4 clusters with _EQN_ using HST imaging and the morphology computation code statmorph. EOS By comparing median morphology of cluster galaxies to CANDELS field galaxies using Monte Carlo analysis, we find that 2 out of 4 clusters (at z=1.19 and z=1.75) have an established morphology-density relationship with more than _EQN_ significance. EOS _EQN_ 50% of galaxies in these clusters are bulge-dominated compared to _EQN_ 30% in the field, and they are significantly more compact.	This result is more significant for low-mass galaxies with _EQN_, showing that low-mass galaxies are affected the most in clusters.
doc	A Critical Review of Concepts, Benefits, and Pitfalls of Blockchain Technology Using Concept Map EOS Blockchain is relatively a new area of research. EOS However, a surge of research studies on the blockchain has taken place in recent years. EOS These research studies have mostly focused on designing and developing conceptual frameworks to build more reliable, transparent and efficient digital systems. EOS While blockchain brings a wide variety of benefits, it also imposes certain challenges. EOS Therefore, the objective of this research is to understand the properties of blockchain, its current uses, observed benefits and pitfalls to provide a balanced understanding of blockchain. EOS A systematic literature review approach was adopted in this paper in order to attain the objective.	A total of 51 articles were selected and reviewed.
doc	On Symmetry and Conserved Quantities in Classical Mechanics EOS This paper expounds the relations between continuous symmetries and conserved quantities, i.e. EOS Noether's ``first theorem'', in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks for classical mechanics. EOS This illustrates one of mechanics' grand themes: exploiting a symmetry so as to reduce the number of variables needed to treat a problem. EOS I emphasise that, for both frameworks, the theorem is underpinned by the idea of cyclic coordinates;	and that the Hamiltonian theorem is more powerful.
doc	Atomic "bomb testing": the Elitzur-Vaidman experiment violates the Leggett-Garg inequality EOS Elitzur and Vaidman have proposed a measurement scheme that, based on the quantum superposition principle, allows one to detect the presence of an object --- in a dramatic scenario, a bomb --- without interacting with it. EOS It was pointed out by Ghirardi that this interaction-free measurement scheme can be put in direct relation with falsification tests of the macro-realistic worldview. EOS Here we have implemented the "bomb test" with a single atom trapped in a spin-dependent optical lattice to show explicitly a violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality --- a quantitative criterion fulfilled by macro-realistic physical theories. EOS To perform interaction-free measurements, we have implemented a novel measurement method that correlates spin and position of the atom. EOS This method, which quantum mechanically entangles spin and position, finds general application for spin measurements, thereby avoiding the shortcomings inherent in the widely used push-out technique.	Allowing decoherence to dominate the evolution of our system causes a transition from quantum to classical behavior in fulfillment of the Leggett-Garg inequality.
doc	Photospheric activity, rotation, and radial velocity variations of the planet-hosting star CoRoT-7 EOS The CoRoT satellite has recently discovered the transits of a telluric planet across the disc of a late-type magnetically active star dubbed CoRoT-7, while a second planet has been detected after filtering out the radial velocity (hereafter RV) variations due to stellar activity.	We investigate the magnetic activity of CoRoT-7 and use the results for a better understanding of its impact on stellar RV variations.

doc	Neutral pion production with respect to reaction plane in Au+Au collisions at RHIC-PHENIX EOS It has been observed that the yield of neutral pions at high transverse momentum (pT _EQN_ 5 GeV/c) region is strongly suppressed in central Au+Au collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), compared to the one expected in p+p collisions. EOS This suppression may be due to an energy loss of hard scattered partons in the medium (jet quenching), that results in a decrease of the yield at a given pT.	The magnitude of the suppression would depend on the path length of scattering partons in the medium, and therefore is associated with azimuthal angle from reaction plane in non-central collisions.

A further 14 sources with featureless spectra have been classified as BL Lac objects.
doc	Lindahl Equilibrium as a Collective Choice Rule EOS A collective choice problem is a finite set of social alternatives and a finite set of economic agents with vNM utility functions. EOS We associate a public goods economy with each collective choice problem and establish the existence and efficiency of (equal income) Lindahl equilibrium allocations. EOS We interpret collective choice problems as cooperative bargaining problems and define a set-valued solution concept, the equitable solution (ES). EOS We provide axioms that characterize ES and show that ES contains the Nash bargaining solution. EOS Our main result shows that the set of ES payoffs is the same a the set of Lindahl equilibrium payoffs.	We consider two applications: in the first, we show that in a large class of matching problems without transfers the set of Lindahl equilibrium payoffs is the same as the set of (equal income) Walrasian equilibrium payoffs.
doc	Axion response in Weyl semimetals EOS Weyl semimetal is a new phase of matter that provides the first solid state realization of chiral Weyl fermions. EOS Most of its unique physics is a consequence of chiral anomaly, namely nonconservation of the number of particles of a given chirality. EOS Mathematically, this is expressed in the appearance of the so called _EQN_ -term in the action of the electromagnetic field, when the Weyl fermions are integrated out.	Recently, however, it has been suggested that the analogy between the chiral fermions of quantum field theory with unbounded linear dispersion, and their solid state realization with a dispersion naturally bounded by the bandwidth and crystal momentum defined only within the first Brillouin zone, holds only in a restricted sense, with parts of the _EQN_ -term absent.

doc	A trio of horseshoes: past, present and future dynamical evolution of Earth co-orbital asteroids 2015 XX169, 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 EOS It is widely accepted that a quasi-steady-state flux of minor bodies moving in and out of the co-orbital state with the Earth may exist. EOS Some of these objects are very good candidates for future in situ study due to their favourable dynamical properties. EOS In this paper, we show that the recently discovered near-Earth asteroids 2015 XX169, 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 are small transient Earth co-orbitals. EOS These new findings increase the tally of known Earth co-orbitals to 17. EOS The three of them currently exhibit asymmetric horseshoe behaviour subjected to a Kozai resonance and their short-term orbital evolution is rather unstable.	Both 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 may leave Earth's co-orbital zone in the near future as they experience close encounters with Venus, the Earth-Moon system and Mars.
doc	Spectroscopy of MACHO 97-SMC-1: self-lensing within the SMC EOS More than a dozen microlensing events have been detected so far towards the LMC and 2 towards the SMC. EOS If all the lenses are in the Galactic halo, both the LMC and the SMC events are expected to have similar time scales. EOS However, the first event towards the SMC, MACHO 97-SMC-1, had a time scale of 123 days which is much larger than the typical time scale for the LMC events. EOS From optical depth estimates, we first show that the stars within the SMC play a dominant role as gravitational lenses and can fully account for the observed microlensing events, mainly due to its large physical depth. EOS We also show that if the lenses are within the Magellanic Clouds, then the SMC events should be longer in duration than the LMC events, a fact that is consistent with the observations. EOS The time scale of the event implies that the mass of the lens is >2 solar masses if it is in the Milky Way disk or halo, in which case the lens is expected to be bright and should reveal itself in the spectrum. EOS Here, we present an optical spectrum of MACHO 97-SMC-1 which shows that the lens is not in the Milky Way disk or halo, but is a low-mass star within the SMC.	It is worth noting here that MACHO SMC-98-1 is the only OTHER observed event towards the SMC.
doc	Dislocation nucleation in the phase field crystal model EOS We use the phase field crystal model to study the nucleation of edge dislocations under an applied stress field. EOS Under quasi-static loading of a perfect lattice, a dislocation dipole nucleates (due to Burgers vector conservation) with Burgers vector and slip plane chosen according to the lattice orientation with respect to the applied stress. EOS The phase field crystal correctly accounts for elastic energy storage prior to nucleation, and for dissipative relaxation during the nucleation event. EOS We show that both a lattice incompatibility field and the resolved stresses are sensitive diagnostics of the fluctuations prior to nucleation, of the location of the nucleation event, and of the Burgers vector and slip direction of the dislocations that will be nucleated upon further increases in the stress. EOS A direct calculation of the phase field energy accurately correlates with the nucleation event as signaled by the lattice incompatibility field.	We finally show that a Schmid-like criterion predicts the critical nucleation stress.
doc	The Vacuum Polarization tensor in 1+1 dimensional space-time EOS Quantum field theory (QFT) is supposed to be gauge invariant. EOS However it has been well established that a direct calculation of the vacuum polarization tensor produces a non-gauge invariant result. EOS In this paper it will be shown that this problem is due to the fact that there is a lower bound to the free field energy in QFT.	The vacuum polarization tensor will be calculated in 1+1 dimensional space-time and is shown not to be gauge invariant.
doc	Compositional Distributional Semantics with Compact Closed Categories and Frobenius Algebras EOS This thesis contributes to ongoing research related to the categorical compositional model for natural language of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark in three ways: Firstly, I propose a concrete instantiation of the abstract framework based on Frobenius algebras (joint work with Sadrzadeh). EOS The theory improves shortcomings of previous proposals, extends the coverage of the language, and is supported by experimental work that improves existing results. EOS The proposed framework describes a new class of compositional models that find intuitive interpretations for a number of linguistic phenomena. EOS Secondly, I propose and evaluate in practice a new compositional methodology which explicitly deals with the different levels of lexical ambiguity (joint work with Pulman). EOS A concrete algorithm is presented, based on the separation of vector disambiguation from composition in an explicit prior step. EOS Extensive experimental work shows that the proposed methodology indeed results in more accurate composite representations for the framework of Coecke et al in particular and every other class of compositional models in general. EOS As a last contribution, I formalize the explicit treatment of lexical ambiguity in the context of the categorical framework by resorting to categorical quantum mechanics (joint work with Coecke). EOS In the proposed extension, the concept of a distributional vector is replaced with that of a density matrix, which compactly represents a probability distribution over the potential different meanings of the specific word.	Composition takes the form of quantum measurements, leading to interesting analogies between quantum physics and linguistics.
doc	Controlled Hawking Process by Quantum Energy Teleportation EOS In this paper, a new quantum mechanical method to extract energy from black holes with contracting horizons is proposed. EOS The method is based on a gedanken experiment on quantum energy teleportation (QET), which has been recently proposed in quantum information theory. EOS We consider this QET protocol for N massless fields in near-horizon regions of large-mass black holes with near-horizon geometry described by the Minkowski metric. EOS For each field, a two-level spin is strongly coupled with the local quantum fluctuation outside the horizon during a short time period. EOS After the measurement of N fields, N-bit information is obtained. EOS During the measurement, positive-energy wave packets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole. EOS The amount of excitation energy is independent of the measurement result. EOS After absorption of the wave packets and increase of the black hole mass, a measurement-result-dependent local operation of the N fields is performed outside the horizon.	Then, accompanying the extraction of positive energy from the quantum fluctuation by the operation, negative-energy wave packets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole, decreasing the black hole mass.
doc	Training Multimodal Systems for Classification with Multiple Objectives EOS We learn about the world from a diverse range of sensory information. EOS Automated systems lack this ability as investigation has centred on processing information presented in a single form. EOS Adapting architectures to learn from multiple modalities creates the potential to learn rich representations of the world - but current multimodal systems only deliver marginal improvements on unimodal approaches. EOS Neural networks learn sampling noise during training with the result that performance on unseen data is degraded. EOS This research introduces a second objective over the multimodal fusion process learned with variational inference.	Regularisation methods are implemented in the inner training loop to control variance and the modular structure stabilises performance as additional neurons are added to layers.

doc	Exact results for curvature-driven coarsening in two dimensions EOS We consider the statistics of the areas enclosed by domain boundaries (`hulls') during the curvature-driven coarsening dynamics of a two-dimensional nonconserved scalar field from a disordered initial state. EOS We show that the number of hulls per unit area that enclose an area greater than _EQN_ has, for large time _EQN_, the scaling form _EQN_, demonstrating the validity of dynamical scaling in this system, where _EQN_ is a universal constant.	Domain areas (regions of aligned spins) have a similar distribution up to very large values of _EQN_.
doc	Unresolved stellar companions with Gaia DR2 astrometry EOS For stars with unresolved companions, motions of the centre of light and that of mass decouple, causing a single-source astrometric model to perform poorly. EOS We show that such stars can be easily detected with the reduced chi2 statistic, or RUWE, provided as part of Gaia DR2. EOS We convert RUWE into the amplitude of the image centroid wobble, which, if scaled by the source distance, is proportional to the physical separation between companions (for periods up to several years). EOS We test this idea on a sample of known spectroscopic binaries and demonstrate that the amplitude of the centroid perturbation scales with the binary period and the mass ratio as expected. EOS We apply this technique to the Gaia DR2 data and show how the binary fraction evolves across the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. EOS The observed incidence of unresolved companions is high for massive young stars and drops steadily with stellar mass, reaching its lowest levels for white dwarfs. EOS We highlight the elevated binary fraction for the nearby Blue Stragglers and Blue Horizontal Branch stars.	We also illustrate how unresolved hierarchical triples inflate the relative velocity signal in wide binaries.
doc	Standard Model Physics at HERA EOS Both components of the Standard Model, QCD and the electroweak sector, are tested in the H1 and ZEUS experiments at HERA. EOS The inclusive ep single and double differential cross sections for neutral and charged current processes are measured in the range of four-momentum transfer squared, Q2, between 0.045 and 30000 GeV2, and Bjorken x between 10^ -6 and 0.65.	The neutral current double differential cross section, from which the proton structure function F2 and the longitudinal structure function FL are extracted, is measured at low x with typically 1% statistical and 2-3% systematic uncertainties.

doc	Credal Model Averaging for classification: representing prior ignorance and expert opinions EOS Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is the state of the art approach for overcoming model uncertainty. EOS Yet, especially on small data sets, the results yielded by BMA might be sensitive to the prior over the models. EOS Credal Model Averaging (CMA) addresses this problem by substituting the single prior over the models by a set of priors (credal set). EOS Such approach solves the problem of how to choose the prior over the models and automates sensitivity analysis. EOS We discuss various CMA algorithms for building an ensemble of logistic regressors characterized by different sets of covariates.	We show how CMA can be appropriately tuned to the case in which one is prior-ignorant and to the case in which instead domain knowledge is available.
doc	Oscillatory thermocapillary instability of a film heated by a thick substrate EOS In this work we consider a new class of oscillatory instabilities that pertain to thermocapillary destabilization of a liquid film heated by a solid substrate. EOS We assume the substrate thickness and substrate-film thermal conductivity ratio are large so that the effect of substrate thermal diffusion is retained at leading order in the long-wave approximation. EOS As a result, system dynamics are described by a nonlinear partial differential equation for the film thickness that is nonlocally coupled to the full substrate heat equation.	Perturbing about a steady quiescent state, we find that its stability is described by a non-self adjoint eigenvalue problem.
doc	Interface Tensions and Perfect Wetting in the Two-Dimensional Seven-State Potts Model EOS We present a numerical determination of the order-disorder interface tension, \sod, for the two-dimensional seven-state Potts model.	We find _EQN_, in good agreement with expectations based on the conjecture of perfect wetting.
doc	Collective Phase Chaos in the Dynamics of Interacting Oscillator Ensembles EOS We study chaotic behavior of order parameters in two coupled ensembles of self-sustained oscillators. EOS Coupling within each of these ensembles is switched on and off alternately, while the mutual interaction between these two subsystems is arranged through quadratic nonlinear coupling. EOS We show numerically that in the course of alternating Kuramoto transitions to synchrony and back to asynchrony, the exchange of excitations between two subpopulations proceeds in such a way that their collective phases are governed by an expanding circle map similar to the Bernoulli map.	We perform the Lyapunov analysis of the dynamics and discuss finite-size effects.
doc	Caught in the act: a helium-reionizing quasar near the line of sight to Q0302-003 EOS We report the discovery of a quasar at z=3.050+/-0.003, closely coincident in redshift with the isolated low-opacity feature seen near z~3.056 in the otherwise black portion of the HeII Gunn-Peterson absorption trough seen toward the z=3.286 background quasar Q0302-003, located 6.5' away on the sky. EOS We explore plausible models for the HeIII ionization zone created by this neighboring quasar and its interception with the line of sight toward Q0302-003.	At its present brightness of V=20.5 and separation of D=3.2 Mpc, the quasar can readily account for the opacity gap in the HeII absorption spectrum of Q0302-003, provided it has been active for t_Q > 10^7 y.
doc	Optical spectroscopic observations of _EQN_ -ray blazar candidates VI. Further observations from TNG, WHT, OAN, SOAR and Magellan telescopes EOS Blazars, one of the most extreme class of active galaxies, constitute so far the largest known population of _EQN_ -ray sources and their number is continuously growing in the Fermi catalogs. EOS However in the latest release of the Fermi catalog there is still a large fraction of sources that are classified as blazar candidate of uncertain type (BCUs) for which optical spectroscopic observations are necessary to confirm their nature and their associations. EOS In addition about 1/3 of the _EQN_ -ray point sources listed in the Third Fermi-LAT Source Catalog (3FGL) are still unassociated and lacking an assigned lower energy counterpart.	Since 2012 we have been carrying out an optical spectroscopic campaign to observe blazar candidates to confirm their nature.
doc	Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing EOS We show how to turn any classifier that classifies well under Gaussian noise into a new classifier that is certifiably robust to adversarial perturbations under the _EQN_ norm. EOS This "randomized smoothing" technique has been proposed recently in the literature, but existing guarantees are loose. EOS We prove a tight robustness guarantee in _EQN_ norm for smoothing with Gaussian noise. EOS We use randomized smoothing to obtain an ImageNet classifier with e.g. EOS a certified top-1 accuracy of 49% under adversarial perturbations with _EQN_ norm less than 0.5 (=127/255).	No certified defense has been shown feasible on ImageNet except for smoothing.

In this sense, this copula is the least informative among the copulas with a given diagonal section.
doc	The Relativistic Inverse Stellar Structure Problem EOS The observable macroscopic properties of relativistic stars (whose equations of state are known) can be predicted by solving the stellar structure equations that follow from Einstein's equation.	For neutron stars, however, our knowledge of the equation of state is poor, so the direct stellar structure problem can not be solved without modeling the highest density part of the equation of state in some way.
doc	Cranked Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov Theory: Superdeformed Bands in the _EQN_ Region EOS Cranked Relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (CRHB) theory is presented as an extension of Relativistic Mean Field theory with pairing correlations to the rotating frame. EOS Pairing correlations are taken into account by a finite range two-body force of Gogny type and approximate particle number projection is performed by Lipkin-Nogami method.	This theory is applied to the description of yrast superdeformed rotational bands observed in even-even nuclei of the _EQN_ mass region.
doc	Quantum Statistical Mechanics as an Exact Classical Expansion with Results for Lennard-Jones Helium EOS The quantum states representing classical phase space are given, and these are used to formulate quantum statistical mechanics as a formally exact double perturbation expansion about classical statistical mechanics. EOS One series of quantum contributions arises from the non-commutativity of the position and momentum operators.	Although the formulation of the quantum states differs, the present results for separate averages of position operators and of momentum operators agree with Wigner (1932) and Kirkwood (1933).
doc	A new splitting method for solving composite monotone inclusions involving parallel-sum operators EOS We propose a new primal-dual splitting method for solving composite inclusions involving Lipschitzian, and parallel-sum-type monotone operators. EOS Our approach extends the framework in REF to a more general class of monotone inclusions in a nontrivial fashion. EOS The main idea is to represent the solution set of both the primal and dual problems using their associated Kuhn-Tucker set, and then develop a projected method to successively approximate a feasible point of the Kuhn-Tucker set. EOS We propose a splitting algorithm based on the resolvent of each maximally monotone operator to construct a primal-dual sequence that weakly converges to a solution of the original problem. EOS The key feature of our method is that it only employes the resolvent of each monotone operator separately, which is different from existing methods in the literature.	As a byproduct, our algorithm can be specialized to solve composite convex minimization problems that uses the proximal-operator of each objective component independently, and is equipped with a weakly convergence guarantee.
doc	A Search for "Dwarf" Seyfert Nuclei. III. Spectroscopic Parameters and Properties of the Host Galaxies EOS We have completed an optical spectroscopic survey of the nuclear regions (r < 200 pc) of a large sample of nearby galaxies. EOS Although the main objectives of the survey are to search for low-luminosity active galactic nuclei and to quantify their luminosity function, the database can be used for a variety of other purposes. EOS This paper presents measurements of the spectroscopic parameters for the 418 emission-line nuclei, along with a compilation of the global properties of all 486 galaxies in the survey. EOS Stellar absorption generally poses a serious obstacle to obtaining accurate measurement of emission lines in nearby galactic nuclei. EOS We describe a procedure for removing the starlight from the observed spectra in an efficient and objective manner.	The main parameters of the emission lines (intensity ratios, fluxes, profile widths, equivalent widths) are measured and tabulated, as are several stellar absorption-line and continuum indices useful for studying the stellar population.
doc	Mathematical modelling of drug delivery from pH-responsive nanocontainers EOS Drug delivery systems represent a promising strategy to treat cancer and to overcome the side effects of chemotherapy. EOS In particular, polymeric nanocontainers have attracted major interest because of their structural and morphological advantages and the variety of polymers that can be used, allowing the synthesis of materials capable of responding to the biochemical alterations of the tumour microenvironment.	While experimental methodologies can provide much insight, the generation of experimental data across a wide parameter space is usually prohibitively time consuming and/or expensive.
doc	Vertical current induced domain wall motion in MgO-based magnetic tunnel junction with low current densities EOS Shifting electrically a magnetic domain wall (DW) by the spin transfer mechanism is one of the future ways foreseen for the switching of spintronic memories or registers. EOS The classical geometries where the current is injected in the plane of the magnetic layers suffer from a poor efficiency of the intrinsic torques acting on the DWs. EOS A way to circumvent this problem is to use vertical current injection. EOS In that case, theoretical calculations attribute the microscopic origin of DW displacements to the out-of-plane (field-like) spin transfer torque. EOS Here we report experiments in which we controllably displace a DW in the planar electrode of a magnetic tunnel junction by vertical current injection. EOS Our measurements confirm the major role of the out-of-plane spin torque for DW motion, and allow to quantify this term precisely.	The involved current densities are about 100 times smaller than the one commonly observed with in-plane currents.
doc	Features in Concert: Discriminative Feature Selection meets Unsupervised Clustering EOS Feature selection is an essential problem in computer vision, important for category learning and recognition. EOS Along with the rapid development of a wide variety of visual features and classifiers, there is a growing need for efficient feature selection and combination methods, to construct powerful classifiers for more complex and higher-level recognition tasks. EOS We propose an algorithm that efficiently discovers sparse, compact representations of input features or classifiers, from a vast sea of candidates, with important optimality properties, low computational cost and excellent accuracy in practice. EOS Different from boosting, we start with a discriminant linear classification formulation that encourages sparse solutions.	Then we obtain an equivalent unsupervised clustering problem that jointly discovers ensembles of diverse features.

EOS An anisotropic behavior of _EQN_ and isotropic nature of _EQN_ under strain are predicted for the two wire orientations.	Compressive (tensile) strain decreases (increases) _EQN_.
doc	The Hierarchical Build-Up of Massive Galaxies and the Intracluster Light since z=1 EOS We use a set of simulation-based models for the dissipationless evolution of galaxies since z=1 to constrain the fate of accreted satellites embedded in dark matter subhalos. EOS These models assign stellar mass to dark matter halos at z=1 by relating the observed galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) to the halo+subhalo mass function monotonically. EOS The evolution of the stellar mass content is then followed using halo merger trees extracted from N-body simulations. EOS Our models are differentiated only in the fate assigned to satellite galaxies once subhalos, within which satellites are embedded, disrupt. EOS These models are confronted with the observed evolution in the massive end of the GSMF, the z~0 brightest cluster galaxy (BCG)-cluster mass relation, and the combined BCG and intracluster light (ICL) luminosity distribution -- all observables expected to evolve approximately dissipationlessly since z=1.	The combined observational constraints favor a model in which the vast majority (>80%) of satellite stars from disrupted subhalos go into the ICL.
doc	3D Face Reconstruction from Light Field Images: A Model-free Approach EOS Reconstructing 3D facial geometry from a single RGB image has recently instigated wide research interest. EOS However, it is still an ill-posed problem and most methods rely on prior models hence undermining the accuracy of the recovered 3D faces.	In this paper, we exploit the Epipolar Plane Images (EPI) obtained from light field cameras and learn CNN models that recover horizontal and vertical 3D facial curves from the respective horizontal and vertical EPIs.
doc	Discovering the Building Blocks of Atomic Systems using Machine Learning EOS Machine learning has proven to be a valuable tool to approximate functions in high-dimensional spaces. EOS Unfortunately, analysis of these models to extract the relevant physics is never as easy as applying machine learning to a large dataset in the first place. EOS Here we present a description of atomic systems that generates machine learning representations with a direct path to physical interpretation. EOS As an example, we demonstrate its usefulness as a universal descriptor of grain boundary systems. EOS Grain boundaries in crystalline materials are a quintessential example of a complex, high-dimensional system with broad impact on many physical properties including strength, ductility, corrosion resistance, crack resistance, and conductivity. EOS In addition to modeling such properties, the method also provides insight into the physical "building blocks" that influence them.	This opens the way to discover the underlying physics behind behaviors by understanding which building blocks map to particular properties.
doc	An Analytical Model for S-ALOHA Performance Evaluation in M2M Networks EOS The S-ALOHA (i.e. EOS slotted-ALOHA) protocol is recently regaining interest in Lower Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) handling M2M traffic. EOS Despite intensive studies since the birth of S-ALOHA, the special features of M2M traffic and requirements highlight the importance of analytical models taking into account performance-affecting factors and giving a thorough performance evaluation.	Fulfilling this necessity is the main focus of this paper: we jointly consider the impact of capture effect, diversity of transmit power levels with imperfect power control.
doc	Detailed Network Measurements Using Sparse Graph Counters: The Theory EOS Measuring network flow sizes is important for tasks like accounting/billing, network forensics and security. EOS Per-flow accounting is considered hard because it requires that many counters be updated at a very high speed; EOS however, the large fast memories needed for storing the counters are prohibitively expensive. EOS Therefore, current approaches aim to obtain approximate flow counts; EOS that is, to detect large elephant flows and then measure their sizes. EOS Recently the authors and their collaborators have developed  a novel method for per-flow traffic measurement that is fast, highly memory efficient and accurate. EOS At the core of this method is a novel counter architecture called "counter braids.'' In this paper, we analyze the performance of the counter braid architecture under a Maximum Likelihood (ML) flow size estimation algorithm and show that it is optimal; EOS that is, the number of bits needed to store the size of a flow matches the entropy lower bound.	While the ML algorithm is optimal, it is too complex to implement.

doc	Salient Facial Features from Humans and Deep Neural Networks EOS In this work, we explore the features that are used by humans and by convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to classify faces. EOS We use Guided Backpropagation (GB) to visualize the facial features that influence the output of a ConvNet the most when identifying specific individuals; EOS we explore how to best use GB for that purpose. EOS We use a human intelligence task to find out which facial features humans find to be the most important for identifying specific individuals. EOS We explore the differences between the saliency information gathered from humans and from ConvNets. EOS Humans develop biases in employing available information on facial features to discriminate across faces. EOS Studies show these biases are influenced both by neurological development and by each individual's social experience.	In recent years the computer vision community has achieved human-level performance in many face processing tasks with deep neural network-based models.
doc	Bethe Ansatz for Yangian Invariants: Towards Super Yang-Mills Scattering Amplitudes EOS We propose that Baxter's Z-invariant six-vertex model at the rational gl(2) point on a planar but in general not rectangular lattice provides a way to study Yangian invariants. EOS These are identified with eigenfunctions of certain monodromies of an auxiliary inhomogeneous spin chain. EOS As a consequence they are special solutions to the eigenvalue problem of the associated transfer matrix. EOS Excitingly, this allows to construct them using Bethe ansatz techniques. EOS Conceptually, our construction generalizes to general (super) Lie algebras and general representations. EOS Here we present the explicit form of sample invariants for totally symmetric, finite-dimensional representations of gl(n) in terms of oscillator algebras. EOS In particular, we discuss invariants of three- and four-site monodromies that can be understood respectively as intertwiners of the bootstrap and Yang-Baxter equation.	We state a set of functional relations significant for these representations of the Yangian and discuss their solutions in terms of Bethe roots.
doc	Determinism and general relativity EOS We investigate the fate of determinism in general relativity (GR), comparing the philosopher's account with the physicist's well-posed initial value formulations. EOS The fate of determinism is interwoven with the question of what it is for a spacetime to be `physically reasonable'. EOS A central concern is the status of global hyperbolicity, a putatively necessary condition for determinism in GR.	While global hyperbolicity may fail to be true of all physically reasonable models, we analyze whether global hyperbolicity should be (i) imposed by fiat;

The simulations confirm that the dynamical friction timescale is significantly shorter in MOND than in equivalent Newtonian systems, i.e.
doc	The Occurrence of Compact Groups of Galaxies Through Cosmic Time EOS We use the outputs of a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation run on the Millennium Simulation to investigate the prevalence of 3D compact groups (CGs) of galaxies from _EQN_ to 0. EOS Our publicly available code identifies CGs using the 3D galaxy number density, the mass ratio of secondary+tertiary to the primary member, mass density in a surrounding shell, the relative velocities of candidate CG members, and a minimum CG membership of three. EOS We adopt "default" values for the first three criteria, representing the observed population of Hickson CGs at _EQN_. EOS The percentage of non-dwarf galaxies (_EQN_) in CGs peaks near _EQN_ for the default set, and between _EQN_ for other parameter sets.	This percentage declines rapidly at higher redshifts (_EQN_), consistent with the galaxy population as a whole being dominated by low-mass galaxies excluded from this analysis.
doc	Geometry of foliations and flows I: Almost transverse pseudo-Anosov flows and asymptotic behavior of foliations EOS Let F be a foliation in a closed 3-manifold with negatively curved fundamental group and suppose that F is almost transverse to a quasigeodesic pseudo-Anosov flow. EOS We show that the leaves of the foliation in the universal cover extend continuously to the sphere at infinity, hence the limit sets are continuous images of the circle. EOS One important corollary is that if F is a Reebless finite depth foliation in a hyperbolic manifold, then it has the continuous extension property. EOS Such finite depth foliations exist whenever the second Betti number is non zero. EOS The result also applies to other classes of foliations, including a large class of foliations where all leaves are dense and infinitely many examples with one sided branching.	One key tool is a detailed understanding of asymptotic properties of almost pseudo-Anosov singular 1-dimensional foliations in the leaves of F lifted to the universal cover.
doc	An open quantum Kirwan map EOS We construct a morphism from the equivariant Fukaya algebra of a Lagrangian brane in the zero level set of a moment map of a Hamiltonian action to the Fukaya algebra of the quotient brane. EOS This morphism induces a map between Maurer-Cartan solution spaces, and intertwines the disk potentials. EOS As an application, we show under some technical hypotheses that weak unobstructedness of an invariant Lagrangian brane implies weak unobstructedness of its quotient. EOS For semi-Fano toric manifolds we give a different proof of the open mirror theorem of Chan-Lau-Leung-Tseng by showing that the potential of a Lagrangian toric orbit in a toric manifold is related to the Givental-Hori-Vafa potential by a change of variable.	We also reprove the results of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono on weak unobstructedness of these toric orbits.

doc	Espaces de Berkovich, polytopes, squelettes et th\'eorie des mod\`eles EOS Let _EQN_ be an analytic space over a non-Archimedean, complete field _EQN_ and let _EQN_ be a family of invertible functions on _EQN_. EOS Let _EQN_ the morphism _EQN_ induced by the _EQN_ 's, and let _EQN_ be the map _EQN_ induced by the norms of the _EQN_ 's. EOS Let us recall two results. EOS 1) The compact set _EQN_ is a polytope of the _EQN_ -vector space _EQN_ (we use the multiplicative notation) ; EOS this is due to Berkovich in the locally algebraic case, and has been extended to the general case by the author. EOS 2) If moreover _EQN_ is Hausdorff and _EQN_ -dimensional, then the pre-image under _EQN_ of the skeleton _EQN_ of _EQN_ has a piecewise-linear structure making _EQN_ a piecewise immersion ; EOS this is due to the author. EOS In this article, we improve 1) and 2), and give new proofs of both of them. EOS Our proofs are based upon the model theory of algebraically closed, non-trivially valued fields. EOS Let us quickly explain what we mean by improving 1) and 2). EOS - Concerning 1), we also prove that if _EQN_, there exists a compact analytic neighborhood _EQN_ of _EQN_, such that for every compact analytic neighborhood _EQN_ of _EQN_ in _EQN_, the germs of polytopes _EQN_ and _EQN_ coincide.	- Concerning 2), we prove that the piecewise linear structure on _EQN_ is canonical, that is, doesn't depend on the map we choose to write it as a pre-image of the skeleton;

doc	A Gated Self-attention Memory Network for Answer Selection EOS Answer selection is an important research problem, with applications in many areas. EOS Previous deep learning based approaches for the task mainly adopt the Compare-Aggregate architecture that performs word-level comparison followed by aggregation. EOS In this work, we take a departure from the popular Compare-Aggregate architecture, and instead, propose a new gated self-attention memory network for the task.	Combined with a simple transfer learning technique from a large-scale online corpus, our model outperforms previous methods by a large margin, achieving new state-of-the-art results on two standard answer selection datasets: TrecQA and WikiQA.

doc	Asymptotic theory of generalized information criterion for geostatistical regression model selection EOS Information criteria, such as Akaike's information criterion and Bayesian information criterion are often applied in model selection. EOS However, their asymptotic behaviors for selecting geostatistical regression models have not been well studied, particularly under the fixed domain asymptotic framework with more and more data observed in a bounded fixed region.	In this article, we study the generalized information criterion (GIC) for selecting geostatistical regression models under a more general mixed domain asymptotic framework.
doc	Filtering out activity-related variations from radial velocities in a search for low-mass planets EOS Variations related to stellar activity and correlated noise can prevent the detections of low-amplitude signals in radial velocity data if not accounted for. EOS This can be seen as the greatest obstacle in detecting Earth-like planets orbiting nearby stars with Doppler spectroscopy regardless of developments in instrumentation and rapidly accumulating amounts of data. EOS We use a statistical model that is not sensitive to aperiodic and/or quasiperiodic variability of stellar origin.	We demonstrate the performance of our model by re-analysing the radial velocities of the moderately active star CoRoT-7 (_EQN_) with a transiting planet whose Doppler signal has proven rather difficult to detect.
doc	Activated diffusiophoresis EOS Perturbations of fluid media can give rise to non-equilibrium dynamics, which may in turn cause motion of immersed inclusions. EOS We consider perturbations ("activations") that are local in space and time, of a fluid density which is conserved, and study the resulting diffusiophoretic phenomena that emerge at a large distance. EOS Specifically, we consider cases where the perturbations propagate diffusively, providing examples from passive and active matter for which this is expected to be the case. EOS Activations can, for instance, be realized by sudden and local changes in interaction potentials of the medium, or by local changes of its activity.	Various analytical results are provided for the case of confinement by two parallel walls.

Unmeasured neutron scattering cross sections are often accounted for incorrectly in Monte Carlo simulations.
doc	Robust multifrequency imaging with MUSIC EOS In this paper, we study the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm often used to image small targets when multiple measurement vectors are available. EOS We show that this algorithm may be used when the imaging problem can be cast as a linear system that admits a special factorization. EOS We discuss several active array imaging configurations where this factorization is exact, as well as other configurations where the factorization only holds approximately and, hence, the results provided by MUSIC deteriorate. EOS We give special attention to the most general setting where an active array with an arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers uses signals of multiple frequencies to image the targets. EOS This setting provides all the possible diversity of information that can be obtained from the illuminations. EOS We give a theorem that shows that MUSIC is robust with respect to additive noise provided that the targets are well separated.	The theorem also shows the relevance of using appropriate sets of controlled parameters, such as excitations, to form the images with MUSIC robustly.

doc	A subarcsecond resolution near-infrared study of Seyfert and `normal' galaxies: I. Imaging data EOS We present new high-resolution near-infrared observations in the J,H and K bands, obtained to study the properties of Seyfert host galaxies. EOS The dataset consists of images in the three bands of practically the entire CfA sample of Seyfert galaxies, and K-band images of a control sample of non-active, `normal', galaxies, matched to the Seyfert sample in the distribution of type and inclination. EOS The spatial resolution and sampling of the new images is a factor 2 better than previously published K-band data. EOS In this paper, we present the data in the form of profiles of surface brightness and color, ellipticity and major axis position angle, as well as greyscale maps of surface brightness in H or K and both J-H and H-K colors. EOS We compare our surface brightness and color profiles with the literature, and find good agreement.	Our data are discussed in detail in three subsequent publications, where we analyze the morphologies of Seyfert and normal hosts, quantify the strength of nonaxisymmetric features in disks and their relationship to nuclear activity, address the question of bar fraction in Seyferts and normal galaxies, and analyze the color information in the framework of emission mechanisms in Seyfert 1s and 2s, and in non-active galaxies.

doc	Sustainability of Transient Kinetic Regimes and Origins of Death EOS It is generally recognized that a distinguishing feature of life is its peculiar capability to avoid equilibration. EOS The origin of this capability and its evolution along the timeline of abiogenesis is not yet understood. EOS We propose to study an analog of this phenomenon that could emerge in non-biological systems. EOS To this end, we introduce the concept of sustainability of transient kinetic regimes. EOS This concept is illustrated via investigation of cooperative effects in an extended system of compartmentalized chemical oscillators under batch and semi-batch conditions. EOS The computational study of a model system shows robust enhancement of lifetimes of the decaying oscillations which translates into the evolution of the survival function of the transient non-equilibrium regime.	This model does not rely on any form of replication.

Creutz's algorithm is a microcanonical generalization of the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm (to sample Gibbs measures, in the canonical ensemble).
doc	Robust Self-Supervised Learning of Deterministic Errors in Single-Plane (Monoplanar) and Dual-Plane (Biplanar) X-ray Fluoroscopy EOS Fluoroscopic imaging that captures X-ray images at video framerates is advantageous for guiding catheter insertions by vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists. EOS Visualizing the dynamical movements non-invasively allows complex surgical procedures to be performed with less trauma to the patient. EOS To improve surgical precision, endovascular procedures can benefit from more accurate fluoroscopy data via calibration. EOS This paper presents a robust self-calibration algorithm suitable for single-plane and dual-plane fluoroscopy. EOS A three-dimensional (3D) target field was imaged by the fluoroscope in a strong geometric network configuration. EOS The unknown 3D positions of targets and the fluoroscope pose were estimated simultaneously by maximizing the likelihood of the Student-t probability distribution function. EOS A smoothed k-nearest neighbour (kNN) regression is then used to model the deterministic component of the image reprojection error of the robust bundle adjustment. EOS The Maximum Likelihood Estimation step and the kNN regression step are then repeated iteratively until convergence. EOS Four different error modeling schemes were compared while varying the quantity of training images. EOS It was found that using a smoothed kNN regression can automatically model the systematic errors in fluoroscopy with similar accuracy as a human expert using a small training dataset.	When all training images were used, the 3D mapping error was reduced from 0.61-0.83 mm to 0.04 mm post-calibration (94.2-95.7% improvement), and the 2D reprojection error was reduced from 1.17-1.31 to 0.20-0.21 pixels (83.2-83.8% improvement).

doc	Fog-Aided Device to Device Networks with Opportunistic Content Delivery EOS In this paper, we investigate the caching placement and content delivery strategy in large-scale fog-aided device to device (F-D2D) networks by exploring the idea of opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) which is originally introduced in cognitive radio (CR). EOS Let _EQN_ denote the point process formed by the conventional user equipments (C-UEs) which request other files except the _EQN_ -th file. EOS Then, to resolve the contentions among the file requests and constrain the `inter-file' interference received at the C-UEs, an opportunistic content delivery strategy is proposed, under which a fog user equipment (F-UE) with the _EQN_ -th file selected as the candidate file based on the random file selection (RFS) scheme or the most requested file selection (MRFS) scheme is designed to detect and exploit the spatial spectrum hole of _EQN_ for the multicast of the _EQN_ -th file to its associated C-UEs. EOS Assuming decentralized probabilistic caching, the activation probability of F-UEs under the proposed opportunistic content delivery strategy is derived. EOS Further, by adopting appropriate approximation, the successful content delivery probability (SCDP) of the F-D2D network is evaluated. EOS We also investigate the caching placement optimization of F-UEs for the maximization of SCDP.	It is shown through both the numerical and simulation results that the proposed opportunistic content delivery strategy can enhance the network SCDP performance.

This paper introduces the novel approach of adaptive twin probability associated with the advanced twin operator that enhances the performance of GA.

EOS AIMS: HESS J1844-030 is a newly confirmed TeV source in the direction of the X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) candidate G29.4+0.1 and the complex radio source G29.37+0.1, which is likely formed by the superposition of a background radio galaxy and a Galactic supernova remnant (SNR). EOS We investigate the possible connection between the SNR, the PWN G29.4+0.1, and HESS J1844-030 to shed light on the astrophysical origin of the TeV emission.	METHODS: We performed an imaging and spectral study of the X-ray emission from the PWN G29.4+0.1 using archival observations obtained with the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes.
doc	Solar modulations by the regular heliospheric electromagnetic field EOS The standard way to model the cosmic ray solar modulations is via the Parker equation, that is as the effect of diffusion in the turbulent magnetic of an expanding solar wind. EOS Calculations performed with this method that do not include a description of the regular magnetic field in the heliosphere predict, in disagreement with the observations, equal modulations for particles and antiparticles. EOS The effects of the regular heliospheric field, that break the the particle/anti-particle symmetry, have been included in the Parker equation adding convection terms associated to the magnetic drift velocity of charged particles moving in non--homogeneous magnetic field.	In this work we take a completely different approach and study the propagation of charged particles in the heliosphere assuming only the presence of the regular magnetic field, and completely neglecting the random component.

doc	Hidden Galaxies Revealed EOS In twenty years, low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies have evolved from being an idiosyncratic notion to being one of the major baryonic repositories in the Universe. EOS The story of their discovery and the characterization of their properties is told here. EOS Their recovery from the noise of the night sky background is a strong testament to the severity of surface brightness selection effects. EOS LSB galaxies have a number of remarkable properties which distinguish them from the more familiar Hubble Sequence of spirals. EOS The two most important are 1) they evolve at a significantly slower rate and may well experience star formation outside of the molecular cloud environment, 2) they are embedded in dark matter halos which are of lower density and more extended than the halos around high surface brightness (HSB) disk galaxies. EOS Compared to HSB disks, LSB disks are strongly dark matter dominated at all radii and show a systematic increase in M/L with central surface brightness. EOS In addition, the recognition that large numbers of LSB galaxies actually exist has changed the form of the galaxy luminosity function and has clearly increased the space density of galaxies at z = 0. EOS Recent CCD surveys have uncovered a population of red LSB disks that may be related to the excess of faint blue galaxies detected at moderate redshifts. EOS LSB galaxies offer us a new window into galaxy evolution and formation which is every bit as important as those processes which have produced easy to detect galaxies.	Indeed, the apparent youth of some LSB galaxies suggest that galaxy formation is a greatly extended process.
doc	Starless Cloud Core L1517B in Envelope Expansion with Core Collapse EOS Various spectral emission lines from star-forming molecular cloud core L1517B manifest red asymmetric double-peaked profiles with stronger red peaks and weaker blue peaks, in contrast to the oft-observed blue-skewed molecular spectral line profiles with blue peaks stronger than red peaks. EOS Invoking a spherically symmetric general polytropic hydrodynamic shock model for the envelope expansion with core collapse (EECC) phase, we show the radial flow velocity, mass density and temperature structures of self-similar evolution for L1517B in a dynamically consistent manner. EOS By prescribing simple radial profiles of abundance distribution for pertinent molecules, we perform molecular excitation and radiative transfer calculations using the publicly available RATRAN code set for the spherically symmetric case. EOS Our computational results show that the EECC model reproduces molecular spectral line profiles in sensible agreement with observational data of IRAM, FCRAO and Effelsberg 100 m telescopes for L1517B. EOS We also report spatially resolved observations of optically thick line HCO+(1-0) using the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13.7 m telescope at Delingha in China and the relevant fitting results. EOS Hyperfine line structures of NH3 and N2H+ transitions are also fitted to consistently reveal the dynamics of central core collapse. EOS As a consistent model check, radial profiles of 1.2 mm and 0.85 mm dust continua observed by IRAM 30 m telescope and SCUBA, respectively, are also fitted numerically using the same EECC model that produces the molecular line profiles. EOS L1517B is likely undergoing an EECC shock phase.	For future observational tests, we also predict several molecular line profiles with spatial distributions, radial profile of sub-millimeter continuum at wavelength 0.45mm, as well as the radial profiles of the column density and visual extinction for L1517B.

doc	Special relativity in decays of hybrids EOS A decay of a heavy hybrid is expected to produce light mesons flying out with speeds comparable to the speed of light and phenomenological models of the decay must respect symmetries of special relativity. EOS We study consequences of this requirement in a class of simple constituent models with spin. EOS Our models respect boost symmetry because they conform to the rules of a boost-invariant renormalization group procedure for effective particles in light-front QCD. EOS But rotational symmetry of the decay amplitude is not guaranteed and the parameters in the model wave functions must take special values in order to obtain the symmetry. EOS When the effective interaction Hamiltonian responsible for a hybrid decay has the same structure as the gluon-quark-antiquark interaction term obtained by solving the renormalization group equations for Hamiltonians in first order perturbation theory, the non-relativistic image of a hybrid as built from a quark and an antiquark and a heavy gluon that typically resides between the quarks, cannot produce rotationally symmetric amplitude.	However, there exists an alternative generic picture in the model that does satisfy the requirements of special relativity.

These simulations indicate that for some initial conditions the post-collapse inner core is indeed unstable.
doc	Unlocking Color and Flavor in Superconducting Strange Quark Matter EOS We explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter with massless u and d quarks as a function of the strange quark mass m_s and the chemical potential mu for baryon number. EOS Neglecting electromagnetism, we describe the different baryonic and quark matter phases at zero temperature. EOS For quark matter, we support our model-independent arguments with a quantitative analysis of a model which uses a four-fermion interaction abstracted from single-gluon exchange. EOS For any finite m_s, at sufficiently large mu we find quark matter in a color-flavor locked state which leaves a global vector-like SU(2)_ color+L+R symmetry unbroken. EOS As a consequence, chiral symmetry is always broken in sufficiently dense quark matter. EOS As the density is reduced, for sufficiently large m_s we observe a first order transition from the color-flavor locked phase to a color superconducting phase analogous to that in two flavor QCD. EOS At this unlocking transition chiral symmetry is restored. EOS For realistic values of m_s our analysis indicates that chiral symmetry breaking may be present for all densities down to those characteristic of baryonic matter.	This supports the idea that quark matter and baryonic matter may be continuously connected in nature.

doc	Measuring the non-thermal pressure in early type galaxy atmospheres: A comparison of X-ray and optical potential profiles in M87 and NGC1399 EOS We compare the gravitational potential profiles of the elliptical galaxies NGC 4486 (M87) and NGC 1399 (the central galaxy in the Fornax cluster) derived from X-ray and optical data. EOS This comparison suggests that the combined contribution of cosmic rays, magnetic fields and micro-turbulence to the pressure is ~10% of the gas thermal pressure in the cores of NGC 1399 and M87, although the uncertainties in our model assumptions (e.g., spherical symmetry) are sufficiently large that the contribution could be consistent with zero. EOS In the absence of any other form of non-thermal pressure support, these upper bounds translate into upper limits on the magnetic field of ~10-20 muG at a distance of 1'-2' from the centers of NGC1399 and M87.	We show that these results are consistent with the current paradigm of cool cluster cores, based on the assumption that AGN activity regulates the thermal state of the gas by injecting energy into the intra-cluster medium.

doc	Dynamic Leidenfrost effect: relevant time- and length-scales EOS When a liquid droplet impacts a hot solid surface, enough vapor may be generated under it as to prevent its contact with the solid. EOS The minimum solid temperature for this so-called Leidenfrost effect to occur is termed the Leidenfrost temperature, or the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature when the droplet velocity is non-negligible. EOS We observe the wetting/drying and the levitation dynamics of the droplet impacting on an (isothermal) smooth sapphire surface using high speed total internal reflection imaging, which enables us to observe the droplet base up to about 100 nm above the substrate surface.	By this method we are able to reveal the processes responsible for the transitional regime between the fully wetting and the fully levitated droplet as the solid temperature increases, thus shedding light on the characteristic time- and length-scales setting the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature for droplet impact on an isothermal substrate.

doc	Does Compton/Schwarzschild duality in higher dimensions exclude TeV quantum gravity? EOS In three spatial dimensions, the Compton wavelength _EQN_) and Schwarzschild radius _EQN_) are dual under the transformation _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the Planck mass. EOS This suggests that there could be a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty Principle or Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary particles with _EQN_ and black holes in the _EQN_ regime. EOS In the presence of _EQN_ extra dimensions, compactified on some scale _EQN_ exceeding the Planck length _EQN_, one expects _EQN_ for _EQN_, which breaks this duality.	However, it may be restored in some circumstances because the effective Compton wavelength of a particle depends on the form of the _EQN_ -dimensional wavefunction.

doc	The POINT-AGAPE Survey I: The Variable Stars in M31 EOS The POINT-AGAPE collaboration has been monitoring M31 for three seasons with the Wide Field Camera on the Isaac Newton Telescope. EOS In each season, data are taken for one hour per night for roughly sixty nights during the six months that M31 is visible. EOS The two fields of view straddle the central bulge, northwards and southwards. EOS We have calculated the locations, periods and amplitudes of 35414 variable stars in M31 as a by-product of our microlensing search. EOS The variables are classified according to their period and amplitude of variation. EOS They are classified into population I and II Cepheids, Miras and semi-regular long-period variables. EOS The population I Cepheids are associated with the spiral arms, while the central concentration of the Miras and long-period variables varies noticeably, the stars with brighter (and shorter) variations being much more centrally concentrated. EOS A crucial role in the microlensing experiment is played by the asymmetry signal. EOS It was initially assumed that the variable stars would not be a serious problem as their distributions would be symmetric. EOS We demonstrate that this assumption is not correct.	We find that differential extinction associated with the dust lanes causes the variable star distributions to be asymmetric.

doc	Contextualizing selection bias in Mendelian randomization: how bad is it likely to be? EOS Selection bias affects Mendelian randomization investigations when selection into the study sample depends on a collider between the genetic variant and confounders of the risk factor-outcome association. EOS However, the relative importance of selection bias for Mendelian randomization compared to other potential biases is unclear. EOS We performed an extensive simulation study to assess the impact of selection bias on a typical Mendelian randomization investigation. EOS Selection bias had a severe impact on bias and Type 1 error rates in our simulation study, but only when selection effects were large. EOS For moderate effects of the risk factor on selection, bias was generally small and Type 1 error rate inflation was not considerable. EOS The magnitude of bias was also affected by the strength of confounder-risk factor and confounder-outcome associations, the structure of the causal diagram and selection frequency. EOS The use of inverse probability weighting ameliorated bias when the selection model was correctly specified, but increased bias when selection bias was moderate and the model was misspecified.	Finally, we investigated whether selection bias may explain a recently reported finding that lipoprotein(a) is not a causal risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in individuals with previous coronary heart disease.
doc	On the Performance of Massive MIMO Systems With Low-Resolution ADCs Over Rician Fading Channels EOS This paper considers uplink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with lowresolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) over Rician fading channels. EOS Maximum-ratio-combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers are considered under the assumption of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). EOS Low-resolution ADCs are considered for both data detection and channel estimation, and the resulting performance is analyzed. EOS Asymptotic approximations of the spectrum efficiency (SE) for large systems are derived based on random matrix theory. EOS With these results, we can provide insights into the trade-offs between the SE and the ADC resolution and study the influence of the Rician K-factors on the performance. EOS It is shown that a large value of K-factors may lead to better performance and alleviate the influence of quantization noise on channel estimation. EOS Moreover, we investigate the power scaling laws for both receivers under imperfect CSI and it shows that when the number of base station (BS) antennas is very large, without loss of SE performance, the transmission power can be scaled by the number of BS antennas for both receivers while the overall performance is limited by the resolution of ADCs. EOS The asymptotic analysis is validated by numerical results. EOS Besides, it is also shown that the SE gap between the two receivers is narrowed down when the K-factor is increased.	We also show that ADCs with moderate resolutions lead to better energy efficiency (EE) than that with high-resolution or extremely low-resolution ADCs and using ZF receivers achieve higher EE as compared with the MRC receivers.

doc	The very low-mass population of the Corona Australis and Chamaeleon II star forming regions EOS We present the results of a deep optical survey in the Corona Australis and Chamaeleon II star forming regions. EOS Our optical photometry is combined with available near- and mid-infrared photometry to identify very low-mass candidate members in these dark clouds. EOS In our Chamaeleon II field, only one object exhibits clear H-alpha emission, but the discrepancy between its optical and near-infrared colours suggests that it might be a foreground star. EOS We also identify two objects without H-alpha emission that could be planetary mass members of Chamaeleon II. EOS In Corona Australis, we find ten stars and three brown dwarf candidates in the Coronet cluster. EOS Five of our new members are identified with ISOCAM sources. EOS Only two of them have a mid-infrared excess, indicating the presence of an accretion disk. EOS On the other hand, one brown dwarf candidate has a faint close companion, seen only in our deepest I-band image.	For many of the candidates in both clouds, membership could not be inferred from their H-alpha emission or near-infrared colours;

doc	The Composition and Mineralogy of Rocky Exoplanets: A Survey of >4,000 Stars from the Hypatia Catalog EOS We present a survey of >4,000 star compositions from the Hypatia Catalog to examine whether rocky exoplanets (i.e., those with rocky surfaces, dominated by silicates) might be geologically similar to Earth, at least with respect to composition and mineralogy. EOS To do so, we explore the variety of reported stellar compositions to then determine a possible range of exoplanetary mantle mineralogies. EOS We find that exoplanetary mantles will likely be dominated by olivine and/or orthopyroxene, depending upon Fe partitioning during core formation. EOS Some exoplanets may be magnesiowustite- or quartz-saturated, and we present a new classification scheme based on the weight _EQN_ ratio (FeO+MgO)/SiO _EQN_, to differentiate rock types. EOS But wholly exotic mineralogies should be rare to absent. EOS We find that half or more of the range of exoplanet mantle mineralogy is controlled by core formation, which we model using _EQN_ = _EQN_ / _EQN_, where _EQN_ is Fe in a Bulk Silicate Planet (bulk planet, minus core), on a cation weight _EQN_ basis (elemental weight proportions, absent anions) and _EQN_ is the cation weight _EQN_ of Fe for a Bulk Planet. EOS In our solar system, _EQN_ varies from 0 (Mercury) to about 0.54 (Mars).	Remaining variations in exoplanet mantle mineralogy result from non-trivial variations in star compositions.
doc	Can local single-pass methods solve any stationary Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation? EOS The use of local single-pass methods (like, e.g., the Fast Marching method) has become popular in the solution of some Hamilton-Jacobi equations. EOS The prototype of these equations is the eikonal equation, for which the methods can be applied saving CPU time and possibly memory allocation. EOS Then, some natural questions arise: can local single-pass methods solve any Hamilton-Jacobi equation? EOS If not, where the limit should be set?	This paper tries to answer these questions.

doc	Learning under _EQN_ -Tampering Attacks EOS Recently, Mahloujifar and Mahmoody (TCC'17) studied attacks against learning algorithms using a special case of Valiant's malicious noise, called _EQN_ -tampering, in which the adversary gets to change any training example with independent probability _EQN_ but is limited to only choose malicious examples with correct labels.	They obtained _EQN_ -tampering attacks that increase the error probability in the so called targeted poisoning model in which the adversary's goal is to increase the loss of the trained hypothesis over a particular test example.
doc	Analysis and control of pre-extinction dynamics in stochastic populations EOS We consider a stochastic population model where the intrinsic or demographic noise causes cycling between states before the population eventually goes extinct. EOS A master equation approach coupled with a WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation is used to construct the optimal path to extinction. EOS In addition, a probabilistic argument is used to understand the pre-extinction dynamics and approximate the mean time to extinction. EOS Analytical results agree well with numerical Monte Carlo simulations.	A control method is implemented to decrease the mean time to extinction.

doc	Geometric chained inequalities for higher-dimensional systems EOS For systems of an arbitrary dimension, a theory of geometric chained Bell inequalities is presented. EOS The approach is based on chained inequalities derived by Pykacz and Santos. EOS For maximally entangled states the inequalities lead to a complete _EQN_ contradiction with quantum predictions. EOS Local realism suggests that the probability for the two observes to have identical results is _EQN_ (that is a perfect correlation is predicted), whereas quantum formalism gives an opposite prediction: the local results always differ.	This is so for any dimension.
doc	Noise Characteristics of Feed Forward Loops EOS A prominent feature of gene transcription regulatory networks is the presence in large numbers of motifs, i.e, patterns of interconnection, in the networks. EOS One such motif is the feed forward loop (FFL) consisting of three genes X, Y and Z. EOS The protein product of x of X controls the synthesis of protein product y of Y. EOS Proteins x and y jointly regulate the synthesis of z proteins from the gene Z. EOS The FFLs, depending on the nature of the regulating interactions, can be of eight different types which can again be classified into two categories: coherent and incoherent. EOS In this paper, we study the noise characteristics of FFLs using the Langevin formalism and the Monte Carlo simulation technique based on the Gillespie algorithm.	We calculate the variances around the mean protein levels in the steady states of the FFLs and find that, in the case of coherent FFLs, the most abundant FFL, namely, the Type-1 coherent FFL, is the least noisy.
doc	Hybrid Gradient Boosting Trees and Neural Networks for Forecasting Operating Room Data EOS Time series data constitutes a distinct and growing problem in machine learning. EOS As the corpus of time series data grows larger, deep models that simultaneously learn features and classify with these features can be intractable or suboptimal.

Focusing on the consequential setting of electronic health record data, we predict the occurrence of hypoxemia five minutes into the future based on past features.
doc	The Smallest Particles in Saturn's A and C Rings EOS Radio occultations of Saturn's main rings by spacecraft suggest a power law particle size-distribution down to sizes of the order of 1 cm (Marouf et al, 1983), (Zebker et al, 1985). EOS The lack of optical depth variations between ultraviolet and near-IR wavelengths indicate a lack of micron-sized particles. EOS Between these two regimes, the particle-size distribution is largely unknown. EOS A cutoff where the particle-size distribution turns over must exist, but the position and shape of it is not clear from existing studies. EOS Using a series of solar occultations performed by the VIMS instrument on-board Cassini in the near-infrared, we are able to measure light forward scattered by particles in the A and C rings. EOS With a model of diffraction by ring particles, and the previous radio work as a constraint on the slope of the particle size distribution, we estimate the minimum particle size using a truncated power-law size distribution. EOS The C Ring shows a minimum particle size of _EQN_ mm, with an assumed power law index of q=3.1 and a maximum particle size of 10 m.	The A Ring signal shows a similar level of scattered flux, but modeling is complicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes and higher optical depths.

EOS The data are combined with IRAC and 2MASS data to investigate _EQN_ 616 sources from 1.25-24 _EQN_.	We use the long-baseline _EQN_ - color to identify two populations with IR excess indicative of circumstellar material: Be stars with 24 _EQN_ excess from optically-thin free free emission and 17 fainter sources (J _EQN_ 14-15) with  excess consistent with a circumstellar disk.
doc	Lossy Compression for Compute-and-Forward in Limited Backhaul Uplink Multicell Processing EOS We study the transmission over a cloud radio access network in which multiple base stations (BS) are connected to a central processor (CP) via finite-capacity backhaul links. EOS We propose two lattice-based coding schemes. EOS In the first scheme, the base stations decode linear combinations of the transmitted messages, in the spirit of compute-and-forward (CoF), but differs from it essentially in that the decoded equations are remapped to linear combinations of the channel input symbols, sent compressed in a lossy manner to the central processor, and are not required to be linearly independent. EOS Also, by opposition to the standard CoF, an appropriate multi-user decoder is utilized to recover the sent messages. EOS The second coding scheme generalizes the first one by also allowing, at each relay node, a joint compression of the decoded equation and the received signal.	Both schemes apply in general, but are more suited for situations in which there are more users than base stations.

doc	Spectroscopy of diffuse ionized gas in halos of selected edge-on galaxies EOS In order to examine the excitation and ionization mechanism of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (DIG) we have obtained optical longslit spectra of seven edge-on spiral galaxies. EOS In four objects the brightest emission lines can be traced out to distances of typically 1.5 kpc above the disk. EOS For NGC1963 and NGC3044 line ratios such as [NII]6583/Ha or [SII]6717/Ha as well as [OIII]5007/Hb could be measured for the halo DIG. EOS This allows us to discuss the DIG in the halo of these objects in the framework of diagnostic diagrams. EOS For these two objects, the line ratios of [OIII]5007/Hb decrease with increasing z, different from the recently reported trend in NGC891 (Rand 1998). EOS We find that emission lines from the DIG in the disks are in good agreement with photoionization models using a dilute radiation field. EOS However, with increasing z these models fail to predict the measured [OI]6300/Ha and HeI5876/Ha line ratios for NGC1963. EOS Diagnostic diagrams reveal for NGC1963 the need for a second ionization mechanism of the halo DIG (besides photoionization). EOS This additional source could be shock ionization.	The same diagrams demonstrate an intermediate classification for NGC3044.
doc	On the internal structure of dyons in _EQN_ super Yang-Mills theories EOS We use the low energy effective _EQN_ action on the Coulomb branch of _EQN_ super Yang-Mills theory to construct approximate field configurations for solitonic dyons in these theories, building on the brane prong description developed in hep-th/0101114. EOS This dovetails closely with the corresponding description of these dyons as string webs stretched between D-branes in the transverse space.	The resulting picture within these approximations shows the internal structure of these dyons (for fixed asymptotic charges) to be molecule-like, with multiple charge cores held together at equilibrium separations, which grow large near lines of marginal stability.

EOS Through we mainly concern with weighted measure algebra M_b(S; EOS w); EOS where w is a weight on a semi-topological semigroup S. EOS We study those con- ditions under which M_b(S; EOS w) is a WAP-algebra (respectively dual Banach algebra).	In particular, M_b(S) is a WAP-algebra (respectively dual Banach algebra) if and only if wap(S) separates the points of S (respectively S is compactly cancellative semigroup).
doc	The Novel Probes Project -- Tests of Gravity on Astrophysical Scales EOS We introduce The Novel Probes Project, an initiative to advance the field of astrophysical tests of the dark sector by creating a forum that connects observers and theorists. EOS This review focuses on tests of gravity and is intended to be of use primarily to observers, but also to theorists with interest in the development of experimental tests. EOS It is twinned with a separate review on tests of dark matter self-interactions (Adhikari et al, in prep.). EOS Our focus is on astrophysical probes of gravity in the weak-field regime, ranging from stars to quasilinear cosmological scales. EOS These are complementary to both strong-field tests and background and linear probes in cosmology.	In particular, the nonlinear screening mechanisms that are an integral part of viable modified gravity models lead to characteristic signals specifically on astrophysical scales.

Within each sheet, the light-cone imaginary time evolution operator is calculated numerically with high precision using DLCQ.

doc	Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with extra dimensions EOS We consider a theory of modified gravity possessing d extra spatial dimensions with a maximally symmetric metric and a scale factor, whose (4+d)-dimensional gravitational action contains terms proportional to quadratic curvature scalars.	Constructing the 4D effective field theory by dimensional reduction, we find that a special case of our action where the additional terms appear in the well-known Gauss-Bonnet combination is of special interest as it uniquely produces a Horndeski scalar-tensor theory in the 4D effective action.
doc	InstanceMotSeg: Real-time Instance Motion Segmentation for Autonomous Driving EOS Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for autonomous vehicles as it can be used to segment objects in a class agnostic manner based on its motion cues. EOS It will enable the detection of objects unseen during training (e.g., moose or a construction truck) generically based on their motion. EOS Although pixel-wise motion segmentation has been studied in the literature, it is not dealt with at instance level, which would help separate connected segments of moving objects leading to better trajectory planning. EOS In this paper, we proposed a motion-based instance segmentation task and created a new annotated dataset based on KITTI, which will be released publicly. EOS We make use of the YOLACT model to solve the instance motion segmentation network by feeding inflow and image as input and instance motion masks as output. EOS We extend it to a multi-task model that learns semantic and motion instance segmentation in a computationally efficient manner.	Our model is based on sharing a prototype generation network between the two tasks and learning separate prototype coefficients per task.
doc	Quantifying Uncertainty in Stochastic Models with Parametric Variability EOS We present a method to quantify uncertainty in the predictions made by simulations of mathematical models that can be applied to a broad class of stochastic, discrete, and differential equation models. EOS Quantifying uncertainty is crucial for determining how accurate the model predictions are and identifying which input parameters affect the outputs of interest. EOS Most of the existing methods for uncertainty quantification require many samples to generate accurate results, are unable to differentiate where the uncertainty is coming from (e.g., parameters or model assumptions), or require a lot of computational resources. EOS Our approach addresses these challenges and opportunities by allowing different types of uncertainty, that is, uncertainty in input parameters as well as uncertainty created through stochastic model components. EOS This is done by combining the Karhunen-Loeve decomposition, polynomial chaos expansion, and Bayesian Gaussian process regression to create a statistical surrogate for the stochastic model.	The surrogate separates the analysis of variation arising through stochastic simulation and variation arising through uncertainty in the model parameterization.

EOS The Newtonian approach is shown to be equivalent to the use of Chetaev's rule to incorporate the constraint within the initially unconstrained formulation. EOS Although the resulting equations are not, in principle, obtained from a variational statement, it is shown that the trajectories coincide with those of geometrical optics in a medium with a suitably chosen refractive index, as prescribed by Fermat's principle of least time.	This fact gives rise to an intriguing mechano-optical analogy.

We refer to such automation tools as bots and, in many software mining scenarios related to developer productivity or code quality it is desirable to identify bots in order to separate their actions from actions of individuals.

doc	Gravitational Wave Probe of High Supersymmetry Breaking Scale EOS A supersymmetric standard model with heavier scalar particles is very interesting from various viewpoints, especially Higgs properties. EOS If the scalar mass scale is O(10-10^4) TeV, the standard model-like Higgs with mass around 125 GeV, which is implied by the recent LHC experiments, is predicted. EOS However this scenario is difficult to be directly tested with collider experiments.	In this paper, we propose a test of this scenario by using observations of primordial gravitational waves (GWs).
doc	Holonomic Quantum Computation with Electron Spins in Quantum Dots EOS With the help of the spin-orbit interaction, we propose a scheme to perform holonomic single qubit gates on the electron spin confined to a quantum dot. EOS The manipulation is done in the absence (or presence) of an applied magnetic field. EOS By adiabatic changing the position of the confinement potential, one can rotate the spin state of the electron around the Bloch sphere in semiconductor heterostructures. EOS The dynamics of the system is equivalent to employing an effective non-Abelian gauge potential whose structure depends on the type of the spin-orbit interaction. EOS As an example, we find an analytic expression for the electron spin dynamics when the dot is moved around a circular path (with radius R) on the two dimensional electron gas (2DEG), and show that all single qubit gates can be realized by tuning the radius and orientation of the circular paths.	Moreover, using the Heisenberg exchange interaction, we demonstrate how one can generate two-qubit gates by bringing two quantum dots near each other, yielding a scalable scheme to perform quantum computing on arbitrary N qubits.

doc	Nonaffine lattice dynamics with the Ewald method reveals strongly nonaffine elasticity of \alpha -quartz EOS A lattice dynamical formalism based on nonaffine response theory is derived for non-centrosymmetric crystals, accounting for long-range interatomic interactions using the Ewald method. EOS The framework takes equilibrated static configurations as input to compute the elastic constants in excellent agreement with both experimental data and calculations under strain. EOS Besides this methodological improvement, which enables faster evaluation of elastic constants without the need of explicitly simulating the deformation process, the framework provides insights into the nonaffine contribution to the elastic constants of \alpha -quartz.	It turns out that, due to the non-centrosymmetric lattice structure, the nonaffine (softening) correction to the elastic constants is very large, such that the overall elastic constants are at least 3-4 times smaller than the affine Born-Huang estimat
doc	Nonasymptotic control of the MLE for misspecified nonparametric hidden Markov models EOS We study the problem of estimating an unknown time process distribution using nonparametric hidden Markov models in the misspecified setting, that is when the true distribution of the process may not come from a hidden Markov model.

The paper discusses these past limitations, relates them to combinatorial complexity (exponential explosion) of algorithms in the past, and further to the static nature of classical logic.
doc	An application of the Ghosh & Lamb model to the accretion powered X-ray pulsar X Persei EOS The accretion-induced pulse-period changes of the Be/X-ray binary pulsar X Persei were investigated over a period of 1996 January to 2017 September. EOS This study utilized the monitoring data acquired with the RXTE/ASM in 1.5 _EQN_ 12 keV and MAXI/GSC in 2 _EQN_ 20 keV. EOS The source intensity changed by a factor of 5 _EQN_ 6 over this period. EOS The pulsar was spinning down for 1996 _EQN_ 2003, and has been spinning up since 2003, as already reported. EOS The spin up/down rate and the 3 _EQN_ 12 keV flux, determined every 250 d, showed a clear negative correlation, which can be successfully explained by the accretion torque model proposed by Ghosh & Lamb (1979).	When the mass, radius and distance of the neutron star are allowed to vary over a range of 1.0 _EQN_ 2.4 solar masses, 9.5 _EQN_ 15 km, and 0.77 _EQN_ 0.85 kpc, respectively, the magnetic field strength of _EQN_ gave the best fits to the observation.

EOS Using these results, we define in this paper a new polynomial invariant on hypergraphs. EOS We give a combinatorial interpretation of this invariant on negative integers which leads to a reciprocity theorem on hypergraphs.	Finally, we use this invariant to recover well-known invariants on other combinatorial objects (graphs, simplicial complexes, building sets etc) as well as the associated reciprocity theorems.

EOS Large efforts were spent by the first author in collecting and restoring electronic versions of new and old source catalogues. EOS Some 67 catalogues with ~520,000 entries were searchable via the "Einstein On-line Service" (EOLS). EOS When EOLS lost maintenance support in 1994 a group at SAO (Russia) started building software tools to search and cross-identify objects between the major radio catalogues, maintained as the "CATalog supporting System" (CATS) at the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO, Russia). EOS The independent efforts in east and west have recently been joined. EOS Almost 400 different source lists with ~2,000,000 entries have been archived (and partly prepared) by us. EOS All 5C and Penticton "P"-surveys and many of the published WSRT survey lists are now available. EOS CATS has been developed by O. EOS Verkhodanov, S. EOS Trushkin, V. EOS Chernenkov at SAO primarily to support RATAN-600 radio observations. EOS CATS runs under LINUX and can process requests on the basis of various net protocols and via email. EOS Almost 70 well-known radio source catalogues and tables with about 1.3 Mrecords are now available via ftp from CATS, as well as their documentation files.	Twenty of the larger tables may be searched simultaneously for objects in rectangular boxes of coordinates.

EOS From two large five-fold terraces on the surface in a short decorated Fibonacci sequence, atomically resolved surface images have been obtained. EOS One of these terraces carries a rare local configuration in a form of a ring. EOS The location of the corresponding sequence of terminations in the bulk model M of icosahedral i-AlPdMn based on the three-dimensional tiling T*(2F) of an F-phase has been estimated using this ring configuration and the requirement from the LEED work of Gierer et al that the average atomic density of the terminations is 0.136 atoms per A^2. EOS A termination contains two atomic plane layers separated by a vertical distance of 0.48 A. EOS The position of the bulk terminations is fixed within the layers of Bergman polytopes in the model M: they are 4.08 A in the direction of the bulk from a surface of the most dense Bergman layers. EOS From the coding windows of the top planes in terminations in M we conclude that a Penrose (P1) tiling is possible on almost all five-fold terraces. EOS The shortest edge of the tiling P1, is either 4.8 A or 7.8 A.	The experimentally derived tiling of the surface with the ring configuration has an edge-length of 8.0 +- 0.3 A and hence matches the minimal edge-length expected from the model.

doc	Responses of Pre-transitional Materials with Stress-Generating Defects to External Stimuli: Superelasticity, Supermagnetostriction, Invar and Elinvar Effects EOS We considered a generic case of pre-transitional materials with static stress-generating defects, dislocations and coherent nano-precipitates, at temperatures close but above the starting temperature of martensitic transformation, Ms. EOS Using the Phase Field Microelasticity theory and 3D simulation, we demonstrated that the local stress generated by these defects produces equilibrium nano-size martensitic embryos (MEs) in pre-transitional state, these embryos being orientation variants of martensite. EOS This is a new type of equilibrium: the thermoelastic equilibrium between the MEs and parent phase in which the total volume of MEs and their size are equilibrium internal thermodynamic parameters. EOS This thermoelastic equilibrium exists only in presence of the stress-generating defects. EOS Cooling the pre-transitional state towards Ms or applying the external stimuli, stress or magnetic field, results in a shift of the thermoelastic equilibrium provided by a reversible anhysteretic growth of MEs that results in a giant ME-generated macroscopic strain. EOS In particular, this effect can be associated with the diffuse phase transformations observed in some ferroelectrics above the Curie point. EOS It is shown that the ME-generated strain is giant and describes a superelasticity if the applied field is stress.	It describes a super magnetostriction if the martensite (or austenite) are ferromagnetic and the applied field is a magnetic field.

doc	Study of _EQN_ production and cold nuclear matter effects in _EQN_ Pb collisions at _EQN_ EOS The production of _EQN_ mesons with rapidity _EQN_ or _EQN_ and transverse momentum _EQN_ is studied with the LHCb detector in proton-lead collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy _EQN_. EOS The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about _EQN_. EOS For the first time the nuclear modification factor and forward-backward production ratio are determined separately for prompt _EQN_ mesons and _EQN_ from _EQN_ -hadron decays. EOS Clear suppression of prompt _EQN_ production with respect to proton-proton collisions at large rapidity is observed, while the production of _EQN_ from _EQN_ -hadron decays is less suppressed. EOS These results show good agreement with available theoretical predictions.	The measurement shows that cold nuclear matter effects are important for interpretations of the related quark-gluon plasma signatures in heavy-ion collisions.

Using the information retained from the first phase, the second phase employs the priority-first search algorithm to the trellis corresponding to the linear block code itself, which guarantees finding the ML decision.

EOS This search graph is constructed based on the Wikipedia bidirectional link structure, the most recent edits on the pages, the importance of the page, and the article quality;	search results are then ranked by the centrality of their network position.
doc	Mott Effect and J/Psi Dissociation at the Quark-Hadron Phase Transition EOS We investigate the in-medium modification of pseudoscalar and vector mesons in a QCD motivated chiral quark model by solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations for quarks and mesons at finite temperature for a wide mass range of meson masses, from light (pi, rho) to open-charm (D, D*) states. EOS At the chiral / deconfinement phase transition, the quark-antiquark bound states enter the continuum of unbound states and become broad resonances (the hadronic Mott effect).	We calculate the in-medium cross sections for charmonium dissociation due to collisions with light hadrons in a chiral Lagrangian approach, and show that the D and D* meson spectral broadening lowers the threshold for charmonium dissociation by pi and rho meson impact.

doc	Equatorial magnetohydrodynamic shallow water waves in the solar tachocline EOS The influence of a toroidal magnetic field on the dynamics of shallow water waves in the solar tachocline is studied. EOS A sub-adiabatic temperature gradient in the upper overshoot layer of the tachocline causes significant reduction of surface gravity speed, which leads to trapping of the waves near the equator and to an increase of the Rossby wave period up to the timescale of solar cycles. EOS Dispersion relations of all equatorial magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shallow water waves are obtained in the upper tachocline conditions and solved analytically and numerically. EOS It is found that the toroidal magnetic field splits equatorial Rossby and Rossby-gravity waves into fast and slow modes. EOS For a reasonable value of reduced gravity, global equatorial fast magneto-Rossby waves (with the spatial scale of equatorial extent) have a periodicity of 11 years, matching the timescale of activity cycles. EOS The solutions are confined around the equator between latitudes 20-40, coinciding with sunspot activity belts. EOS Equatorial slow magneto-Rossby waves have a periodicity of 90-100 yr, resembling the observed long-term modulation of cycle strength, i.e., the Gleissberg cycle. EOS Equatorial magneto-Kelvin and slow magneto-Rossby-gravity waves have the periodicity of 1-2 years and may correspond to observed annual and quasi-biennial oscillations. EOS Equatorial fast magneto-Rossby-gravity and magneto-inertia-gravity waves have periods of hundreds of days and might be responsible for observed Rieger-type periodicity.	Consequently, the equatorial MHD shallow water waves in the upper overshoot tachocline may capture all timescales of observed variations in solar activity, but detailed analytical and numerical studies are necessary to make a firm conclusion toward the connection of the waves to the solar dynamo.

doc	CAn't Touch This: Practical and Generic Software-only Defenses Against Rowhammer Attacks EOS Rowhammer is a hardware bug that can be exploited to implement privilege escalation and remote code execution attacks. EOS Previous proposals on rowhammer mitigation either require hardware changes or follow heuristic-based approaches (based on CPU performance counters). EOS To date, there exists no instant protection against rowhammer attacks on legacy systems. EOS In this paper, we present the design and implementation of two practical and efficient software-only defenses against rowhammer attacks. EOS Our defenses prevent the attacker from leveraging rowhammer to corrupt physically co-located data in memory that is owned by a different system entity. EOS Our first defense, B-CATT, extends the system bootloader to disable vulnerable physical memory. EOS B-CATT is highly practical, does not require changes to the operating system, and can be deployed on virtually all x86-based systems. EOS While B-CATT is able to stop all known rowhammer attacks, it does not yet tackle the fundamental problem of missing memory isolation in physical memory.	To address this problem, we introduce our second defense G-CATT, a generic solution that extends the physical memory allocator of the OS to physically isolate the memory of different system entities (e.g., kernel and user space).

doc	Merging black holes in young star clusters EOS Searching for distinctive signatures, which characterize different formation channels of binary black holes (BBHs), is a crucial step towards the interpretation of current and future gravitational wave detections. EOS Here, we investigate the demography of merging BBHs in young star clusters (SCs), which are the nursery of massive stars. EOS We performed _EQN_ N-body simulations of SCs with metallicity _EQN_, initial binary fraction _EQN_ and fractal initial conditions, to mimic the clumpiness of star forming regions. EOS Our simulations include a novel population-synthesis approach based on the code MOBSE. EOS We find that SC dynamics does not affect the merger rate significantly, but leaves a strong fingerprint on the properties of merging BBHs. EOS More than 50 % of merging BBHs in young SCs form by dynamical exchanges in the first few Myr. EOS Dynamically formed merging BBHs are significantly heavier than merging BBHs in isolated binaries: merging BBHs with total mass up to _EQN_ M _EQN_ form in young SCs, while the maximum total mass of merging BBHs in isolated binaries with the same metallicity is only _EQN_ M _EQN_. EOS Merging BBHs born via dynamical exchanges tend to have smaller mass ratios than BBHs in isolated binaries. EOS Furthermore, SC dynamics speeds up the merger: the delay time between star formation and coalescence is significantly shorter in young SCs. EOS In our simulations, massive systems such as GW170729 form only via dynamical exchanges.	Finally _EQN_ % of merging BBHs in young SCs have mass in the pair-instability mass gap (_EQN_ M _EQN_).

doc	A new simple dynamo model for stellar activity cycle EOS A new simple dynamo model for stellar activity cycle is proposed. EOS By considering an inhomogeneous mean flow effect on turbulence, it is shown that turbulent cross helicity (velocity--magnetic-field correlation) should enter the expression of turbulent electromotive force as the coupling coefficient for the mean absolute vorticity. EOS The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes the present model different from the current _EQN_ -- _EQN_ -type models mainly in two points. EOS First, in addition to the usual _EQN_ (helicity effect) and _EQN_ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the _EQN_ coefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process. EOS Second, unlike the _EQN_ and _EQN_ coefficients, which are often treated as an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution of _EQN_ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field equations. EOS The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross helicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation by the turbulent cross helicity. EOS The _EQN_ effect generates the poloidal field from the toroidal one. EOS This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross helicity whose sign is opposite to the original one.	Then a cycle of reversal completes.

doc	Quasi-two-dimensional thermoelectricity in SnSe EOS Stannous selenide is a layered semiconductor that is a polar analogue of black phosphorus, and of great interest as a thermoelectric material. EOS Unusually, hole doped SnSe supports a large Seebeck coefficient at high conductivity, which has not been explained to date. EOS Angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy, optical reflection spectroscopy and magnetotransport measurements reveal a multiple-valley valence band structure and a quasi two-dimensional dispersion, realizing a Hicks-Dresselhaus thermoelectric contributing to the high Seebeck coefficient at high carrier density. EOS We further demonstrate that the hole accumulation layer in exfoliated SnSe transistors exhibits a field effect mobility of up to _EQN_ at _EQN_.	SnSe is thus found to be a high quality, quasi two-dimensional semiconductor ideal for thermoelectric applications.

doc	New study of the Boer-Mulders function: Implications for the quark and hadron transverse momenta EOS In series of papers the Boer-Mulders function for a given quark flavour has been extracted: (i) from data on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, using the simplifying, but theoretically inconsistent, assumption that it is proportional to the Sivers function for each quark flavour and (ii) from data on Drell-Yan reactions. EOS In earlier papers, using the semi-inclusive deep inelastic COMPASS deuteron data on the _EQN_ and _EQN_ asymmetries, we extracted the collinear _EQN_ dependence of the Boer-Mulders function for the sum of the valence quarks _EQN_ using a small number of model dependent assumptions and found a significant disagreement with the analysis in (i). EOS In the present paper, we provide a more complete analysis of the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering reaction, including a discussion of higher twist and interaction-dependent terms, and also a comparison with the Boer-Mulders function extracted from data on the Drell-Yan reaction. EOS We confirm that the proportionality relation of the BM function to the Sivers function, for each quark flavour, fails badly, but find that it holds rather well if applied to the nonsinglet valence-quark combination, _EQN_. EOS We also find good agreement with the results of the Drell-Yan analysis.	Furthermore, we obtain interesting information on the quark transverse momentum densities in the nucleon and on the hadron transverse momentum dependence in quark fragmentation.
doc	Path probabilities for consecutive measurements, and certain "quantum paradoxes" EOS We consider a finite-dimensional quantum system, making a transition between known initial and final states.

If the measurements are actually made, the paths, which may now be called "real", acquire also the probabilities, related to the frequencies, with which a path is seen to be travelled in a series of identical trials.
doc	Hardness of Bichromatic Closest Pair with Jaccard Similarity EOS Consider collections _EQN_ and _EQN_ of red and blue sets, respectively. EOS Bichromatic Closest Pair is the problem of finding a pair from _EQN_ that has similarity higher than a given threshold according to some similarity measure. EOS Our focus here is the classic Jaccard similarity _EQN_ for _EQN_. EOS We consider the approximate version of the problem where we are given thresholds _EQN_ and wish to return a pair from _EQN_ that has Jaccard similarity higher than _EQN_ if there exists a pair in _EQN_ with Jaccard similarity at least _EQN_. EOS The classic locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm of Indyk and Motwani (STOC '98), instantiated with the MinHash LSH function of Broder et al, solves this problem in _EQN_ time if _EQN_. EOS In particular, for _EQN_, the approximation ratio _EQN_ increases polynomially in _EQN_.	In this paper we give a corresponding hardness result.
doc	Activity in Galactic Nuclei of Compact Group Galaxies in the Local Universe EOS We study the nuclear activity of galaxies in local compact groups. EOS We use a spectroscopic sample of 238 galaxies in 58 compact groups from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7 to estimate the fraction of AGN-host galaxies in compact groups, and to compare it with those in cluster and field regions. EOS We use emission-line ratio diagrams to identify AGN-host galaxies, and find that the AGN fraction of compact group galaxies is 17-42% depending on the AGN classification method. EOS The AGN fraction in compact groups is not the highest among the galaxy environments.	This trend remains even if we use several subsamples segregated by galaxy morphology and optical luminosity.
doc	Defining an intrinsic stickiness parameter of stock price returns EOS We introduce a non linear pricing model of individual stock returns that defines a stickiness parameter of the returns.

The link to tectonic plate movements happens, since price movements of a given stock index is seen adding stress to its components of individual stock returns, in order to follow the index.

EOS A total of 21,743 tracks of nuclei heavier than iron have been identified in meteoritic matter to date to form the largest database within this charge range. EOS The database includes three tracks of superheavy nuclei with the lifetimes of about a few decades, which can be considered as direct experimental evidence for the existence of natural superheavy nuclei from the "island of stability".

A Universe with pure mirror matter can fit very well the observations, equivalently to the case of an admixture with cold dark matter.
doc	Artificial trapping of a stable high-density dipolar exciton fluid EOS We present compelling experimental evidence for a successful electrostatic trapping of two-dimensional dipolar excitons that results in stable formation of a well confined, high-density and spatially uniform dipolar exciton fluid.

This method should allow for the study of strongly interacting bosons in two dimensions at low temperatures, and possibly lead towards the observation of quantum phase transitions of 2D interacting excitons, such as superfluidity and crystallization.

doc	Identification and quantification of Granger causality between gene sets EOS Wiener and Granger have introduced an intuitive concept of causality between two variables which is based on the idea that an effect never occurs before its cause. EOS Later, Geweke has generalized this concept to a multivariate Granger causality, i.e., n variables Granger-cause another variable. EOS Although Granger causality is not "effective causality", this concept is useful to infer directionality and information flow in observational data. EOS Granger causality is usually identified by using VAR models due to their simplicity. EOS In the last few years, several VAR-based models were presented in order to model gene regulatory networks. EOS Here, we generalize the multivariate Granger causality concept in order to identify Granger causalities between sets of gene expressions, i.e., whether a set of n genes Granger-causes another set of m genes, aiming at identifying and quantifying the flow of information between gene networks (or pathways). EOS The concept of Granger causality for sets of variables is presented. EOS Moreover, a method for its identification with a bootstrap test is proposed. EOS This method is applied in simulated and also in actual biological gene expression data in order to model regulatory networks. EOS This concept may be useful to understand the complete information flow from one network or pathway to the other, mainly in regulatory networks. EOS Linking this concept to graph theory, sink and source can be generalized to node sets.	Moreover, hub and centrality for sets of genes can be defined based on total information flow.

The necessary and sufficient criterion of separability for the three qubit X shaped state is given to illustrate the procedure of finding the criterion.
doc	Bound orbits of a slowly evolving black hole EOS Bound orbits of black holes are very well understood. EOS Given a Kerr black hole of mass _EQN_ and spin _EQN_, it is simple to characterize its orbits as functions of the orbit's geometry. EOS How do the orbits change if the black hole is itself evolving? EOS How do the orbits change if the orbiting body evolves? EOS In this paper, we consider a process that changes a black hole's mass and spin, acting such that the spacetime is described by the Kerr solution at any moment, or that changes the orbiting body's mass.	Provided this change happens slowly, the orbit's actions (_EQN_) are adiabatic invariants, and thus are constant during this process.

EOS Now-a-days, real-time multimedia applications have evolved largely over the Internet. EOS Most of multimedia services are unresponsive during network congestion. EOS Unresponsive traffic streams steal most network bandwidth and starve out some other flows which are responsive during network congestion. EOS In the presence of these unresponsive traffic flows, protection of responsive flows has become a major issue. EOS Many Active Queue Management (AQM) based solutions have been recommended to protect responsive traffic flows from unresponsive ones and to ensure fairness among all traffic flows. EOS The thesis proposes a novel AQM scheme CHOKeD, to deliver fairness among all flows of a congested link. EOS It is a completely stateless approach. EOS CHOKeD is based on dynamic drawing factor to penalize unresponsive traffic.	It successfully protects responsive flows in the presence of unresponsive flows.

EOS We comment on the space-time topological quantum field theory (TQFT) interpretation of this result.	We also investigate the GDS in the presence of time reversal symmetry, showing that it forms a non-trivial symmetry enriched toric code phase in odd spatial dimensions.
doc	On Differential Properties of Multifunctions Defined Implicitly by Set-Valued Inclusions EOS In the present paper, several properties concerning generalized derivatives of multifunctions implicitly defined by set-valued inclusions are studied by techniques of variational analysis.	Set-valued inclusions are problems formalizing the robust fulfilment of cone constraint systems, whose data are affected by a "crude knowledge" of uncertain elements, so they can not be casted in traditional generalized equations.
doc	X-ray spectroscopy of the ADC source X1822-371 with Chandra and XMM-Newton EOS The eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary X1822-371 is the prototype of the accretion disc corona (ADC) sources. EOS We analyse two Chandra observations and one XMM-Newton observation to study the discrete features and their variation as a function of the orbital phase, deriving constraints on the temperature, density, and location of the plasma responsible for emission lines. EOS The HETGS and XMM/Epic-pn observed X1822-371 for 140 and 50 ks, respectively. EOS We extracted an averaged spectrum and five spectra from five selected orbital-phase intervals that are 0.04-0.25, 0.25-0.50, 0.50-0.75, 0.75-0.95, and, finally, 0.95-1.04; EOS the orbital phase zero corresponds to the eclipse time. EOS All spectra cover the energy band between 0.35 and 12 keV.	We confirm the presence of local neutral matter that partially covers the X-ray emitting region;
doc	Light Element Chemistry and the Double Red Giant Branch in the Galactic Globular Cluster NGC 288 EOS The globular cluster NGC 288 was previously reported to exhibit two distinct red giant branches (RGBs) in the narrow-band Calcium (HK) and Str\"omgren b and y band passes. EOS In order to investigate this phenomenon further, we obtained moderate resolution (R _EQN_ 18,000) spectra of 27 RGB stars in NGC 288 with the Hydra multifiber spectrograph on the Blanco 4m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. EOS From these data we derive iron (_EQN_ [Fe/H] _EQN_ =-1.19; EOS _EQN_ =0.12), oxygen (_EQN_ [O/Fe] _EQN_ = _EQN_ 0.25; EOS _EQN_ =0.13), and sodium (_EQN_ [Na/Fe] _EQN_ = _EQN_ 0.15; EOS _EQN_ =0.26) abundances using standard equivalent width and spectrum synthesis techniques.	Combining these data with those available in the literature indicates that the two giant branches have distinctly different light element chemistry but do not exhibit a significant spread in [Fe/H].
doc	A simple tensor network algorithm for two-dimensional steady states EOS Understanding dissipation in 2D quantum many-body systems is a remarkably difficult open challenge. EOS Here we show how numerical simulations for this problem are possible by means of a tensor network algorithm that approximates steady-states of 2D quantum lattice dissipative systems in the thermodynamic limit. EOS Our method is based on the intuition that strong dissipation kills quantum entanglement before it gets too large to handle. EOS We test its validity by simulating a dissipative quantum Ising model, relevant for dissipative systems of interacting Rydberg atoms, and benchmark our simulations with a variational algorithm based on product and correlated states. EOS Our results support the existence of a first order transition in this model, with no bistable region.	We also simulate a dissipative spin-1/2 XYZ model, showing that there is no re-entrance of the ferromagnetic phase.
doc	A neglected topic in relativistic electrodynamics: transformation of electromagnetic integrals EOS Although relativistic electrodynamics is more than 100 year old, there is one neglected topic in its presentation and application: relativistic transformations of electromagnetic integrals.	Whereas in theoretical and applied electrodynamics electric and magnetic fields are mainly expressed in terms of integrals over charge and current distributions, relativistic transformations are traditionally applied to point charges and elementary currents.
doc	The Millennium Outburst of the Cool Hypergiant Rho Cassiopeiae: Spectroscopy and Modeling EOS Between 2000 June and September an exceptional variability phase occurred in the peculiar F-type hypergiant Rho Cas, when the V-brightness dimmed by at least a full magnitude. EOS The star recovered from this deep minimum by 2001 April. EOS It is the third outburst of Rho Cas on record in the last century. EOS We observe TiO absorption bands in high-resolution optical and near-IR spectra obtained with the Utrecht Echelle Spectrograph during the summer of 2000. EOS TiO formation in the outer atmosphere occurred before the deep brightness minimum.Atmospheric models reveal that the effective temperature decreases by at least 3000 K, and the TiO shell is driven supersonically with Mdot =~5.4 10^-2 Msun/yr. EOS Strong episodic mass loss and TiO have also been observed during the outbursts of 1945-47 and 1985-86. EOS An analysis of the exceptional outburst spectra of 2000-01 is provided, by comparing with high-resolution optical spectra of the early M-type supergiants Mu Cep (Ia) and Betelgeuse (Iab). EOS During the outburst, central emission appears above the local continuum level in the split Na D lines. EOS The outburst spectra indicate the formation of a low- temperature, optically thick circumstellar gas shell of 3 10^-2 Msun during \~200 d, caused by dynamic instability of the upper atmosphere of this pulsating massive supergiant near the Eddington luminosity limit.	We present an equation that correctly predicts the outburst time-scale, whereby the shell ejection is driven by the release of hydrogen recombination energy.
doc	MSE-based analysis of optimal tuning functions predicts phenomena observed in sensory neurons EOS Biological systems display impressive capabilities in effectively responding to environmental signals in real time. EOS There is increasing evidence that organisms may indeed be employing near optimal Bayesian calculations in their decision-making. EOS An intriguing question relates to the properties of optimal encoding methods, namely determining the properties of neural populations in sensory layers that optimize performance, subject to physiological constraints.	Within an ecological theory of neural encoding/decoding, we show that optimal Bayesian performance requires neural adaptation which reflects environmental changes.

doc	Revisiting Tardos's Framework for Linear Programming: Faster Exact Solutions using Approximate Solvers EOS In breakthrough work, Tardos (Oper. EOS Res. EOS '86) gave a proximity based framework for solving linear programming (LP) in time depending only on the constraint matrix in the bit complexity model. EOS In Tardos's framework, one reduces solving the LP _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, to solving _EQN_ LPs in _EQN_ having small integer coefficient objectives and right-hand sides using any exact LP algorithm. EOS This gives rise to an LP algorithm in time poly _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the largest subdeterminant of _EQN_. EOS A significant extension to the real model of computation was given by Vavasis and Ye (Math. EOS Prog. EOS '96), giving a specialized interior point method that runs in time poly _EQN_, depending on Stewart's _EQN_, a well-studied condition number. EOS In this work, we extend Tardos's original framework to obtain such a running time dependence. EOS In particular, we replace the exact LP solves with approximate ones, enabling us to directly leverage the tremendous recent algorithmic progress for approximate linear programming. EOS More precisely, we show that the fundamental "accuracy" needed to exactly solve any LP in _EQN_ is inverse polynomial in _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS Plugging in the recent algorithm of van den Brand (SODA '20), our method computes an optimal primal and dual solution using _EQN_ arithmetic operations, outperforming the specialized interior point method of Vavasis and Ye and its recent improvement by Dadush et al (STOC '20).	At a technical level, our framework combines together approximate LP solutions to compute exact ones, making use of constructive proximity theorems -- which bound the distance between solutions of "nearby" LPs -- to keep the required accuracy low.
doc	Few-Shot Goal Inference for Visuomotor Learning and Planning EOS Reinforcement learning and planning methods require an objective or reward function that encodes the desired behavior. EOS Yet, in practice, there is a wide range of scenarios where an objective is difficult to provide programmatically, such as tasks with visual observations involving unknown object positions or deformable objects. EOS In these cases, prior methods use engineered problem-specific solutions, e.g., by instrumenting the environment with additional sensors to measure a proxy for the objective.	Such solutions require a significant engineering effort on a per-task basis, and make it impractical for robots to continuously learn complex skills outside of laboratory settings.

Beforehand, the problematic status - physical size or simple parameter - of interfacial tension in CNT was audited.

doc	Nonlinear collisional absorption of laser light in dense, strongly coupled plasmas EOS We present a new theoretical approach for collisional absorption of laser energy in dense plasmas which accommodates arbitrary frequencies and high intensities of the laser field. EOS We establish a connection between laser absorption by inverse Bremstrahlung and the stopping power. EOS This relation is then applied to include strong correlations beyond the mean field approach.	The results show an excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations up to very high coupling strength.
doc	The X-ray/SZ view of the virial region. II. Gas mass fraction EOS Several recent studies used the hot gas fraction of galaxy clusters as a standard ruler to constrain dark energy, which provides competitive results compared to other techniques. EOS This method, however, relies on the assumption that the baryon fraction in clusters agrees with the cosmic value Omega_b/Omega_m, and does not differ from one system to another. EOS We test this hypothesis by measuring the gas mass fraction over the entire cluster volume in a sample of local clusters. EOS Combining the SZ thermal pressure from Planck and the X-ray gas density from ROSAT, we measured for the first time the average gas fraction (fgas) out to the virial radius and beyond in a large sample of clusters. EOS We also obtained azimuthally-averaged measurements of the gas fraction for 18 individual systems, which we used to compute the scatter of fgas around the mean value at different radii and its dependence on the cluster's temperature.	The gas mass fraction increases with radius and reaches the cosmic baryon fraction close to R200.

doc	Inferring High Quality Co-Travel Networks EOS Social networks provide a new perspective for enterprises to better understand their customers and have attracted substantial attention in industry. EOS However, inferring high quality customer social networks is a great challenge while there are no explicit customer relations in many traditional OLTP environments. EOS In this paper, we study this issue in the field of passenger transport and introduce a new member to the family of social networks, which is named Co-Travel Networks, consisting of passengers connected by their co-travel behaviors. EOS We propose a novel method to infer high quality co-travel networks of civil aviation passengers from their co-booking behaviors derived from the PNRs (Passenger Naming Records). EOS In our method, to accurately evaluate the strength of ties, we present a measure of Co-Journey Times to count the co-travel times of complete journeys between passengers. EOS We infer a high quality co-travel network based on a large encrypted PNR dataset and conduct a series of network analyses on it. EOS The experimental results show the effectiveness of our inferring method, as well as some special characteristics of co-travel networks, such as the sparsity and high aggregation, compared with other kinds of social networks.	It can be expected that such co-travel networks will greatly help the industry to better understand their passengers so as to improve their services.
doc	Inferring source properties of monoenergetic electron precipitation from kappa and Maxwellian moment-voltage relationships EOS We present two case studies of FAST electrostatic analyzer measurements of both highly nonthermal (_EQN_ ~2.5) and weakly nonthermal/thermal monoenergetic electron precipitation at _EQN_ 4000~km, from which we infer the properties of the magnetospheric source distributions via comparison of experimentally determined number density--, current density--, and energy flux--voltage relationships with corresponding theoretical relationships. EOS We also discuss the properties of the two new theoretical number density--voltage relationships that we employ.	Moment uncertainties, which are calculated analytically via application of the REF Gershman2015 moment uncertainty framework, are used in Monte Carlo simulations to infer ranges of magnetospheric source population densities, temperatures, _EQN_ values, and altitudes.
doc	Parton rescattering and screening in Au+Au collisions at RHIC EOS We study the microscopic dynamics of quarks and gluons in relativistic heavy ion collisions in the framework of the Parton Cascade Model. EOS We use lowest order perturbative QCD cross sections with fixed lower momentum cutoff p_0. EOS We calculate the time-evolution of the Debye-screening mass for Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV per nucleon pair. EOS The screening mass is used to determine a lower limit for the allowed range of p_0.	We also determine the energy density reached through hard and semi-hard processes at RHIC, obtain a lower bound for the rapidity density of charged hadrons produced by semihard interactions, and analyze the extent of perturbative rescattering among partons.

EOS This function rapidly tends to zero as _EQN_ and to some positive constant c as _EQN_. EOS In 1989 E. EOS Khruslov and V.	Kotlyarov have found that for a large time the solution breaks up into a train of asymptotic solitons located in the domain _EQN_ (_EQN_ is a constant).
doc	Photon transport enhanced by transverse Anderson localization in disordered superlattices EOS One of the daunting challenges in optical physics is to accurately control the flow of light at the subwavelength scale, by patterning the optical medium one can design anisotropic media. EOS The light transport can also be significantly affected by Anderson localization, namely the wave localization in a disordered medium, a ubiquitous phenomenon in wave physics. EOS Here we report the photon transport and collimation enhanced by transverse Anderson localization in chip-scale dispersion engineered anisotropic media. EOS We demonstrate a new type of anisotropic photonic structure in which diffraction is nearly completely arrested by cascaded resonant tunneling through transverse guided resonances.	By perturbing the shape of more than 4,000 scatterers in these superlattices we add structural disordered in a controlled manner and uncover the mechanism of disorder-induced transverse localization at the chip-scale.

doc	Flexible superconducting Nb transmission lines on thin film polyimide for quantum computing applications EOS We describe progress and initial results achieved towards the goal of developing integrated multi-conductor arrays of shielded controlled-impedance flexible superconducting transmission lines with ultra-miniature cross sections and wide bandwidths (dc to >10 GHz) over meter-scale lengths. EOS Intended primarily for use in future scaled-up quantum computing systems, such flexible thin-film Nb/polyimide ribbon cables provide a physically compact and ultra-low thermal conductance alternative to the rapidly increasing number of discrete coaxial cables that are currently used by quantum computing experimentalists to transmit signals between the low-temperature stages (from ~ 4 K down to ~ 20 mK) of a dilution refrigerator. EOS S-parameters are presented for 2-metal layer Nb microstrip structures with lengths ranging up to 550 mm. EOS Weakly coupled open-circuit microstrip resonators provided a sensitive measure of the overall transmission line loss as a function of frequency, temperature, and power. EOS Two common polyimide dielectrics, one conventional and the other photo-definable (PI-2611 and HD-4100, respectively) were compared. EOS Our most striking result, not previously reported to our knowledge, was that the dielectric loss tangents of both polyimides are remarkably low at deep cryogenic temperatures, typically 100 _EQN_ smaller than corresponding room temperature values. EOS This enables fairly long-distance transmission of microwave signals without excessive attenuation and permits usefully high rf power levels to be transmitted without creating excessive dielectric heating. EOS We observed loss tangents as low as 2.2 _EQN_ 10 _EQN_ at 20 mK.	Our fabrication techniques could be extended to more complex structures such as multiconductor, multi-layer stripline or rectangular coax, and integrated attenuators and thermalization structures.
doc	The Hierarchical Random Energy Model EOS We introduce a Random Energy Model on a hierarchical lattice where the interaction strength between variables is a decreasing function of their mutual hierarchical distance, making it a non-mean field model.	Through small coupling series expansion and a direct numerical solution of the model, we provide evidence for a spin glass condensation transition similar to the one occuring in the usual mean field Random Energy Model.
doc	Latent Variable Session-Based Recommendation EOS Session based recommendation provides an attractive alternative to the traditional feature engineering approach to recommendation. EOS Feature engineering approaches require hand tuned features of the users history to be created to produce a context vector. EOS In contrast a session based approach is able to dynamically model the users state as they act. EOS We present a probabilistic framework for session based recommendation. EOS A latent variable for the user state is updated as the user views more items and we learn more about their interests. EOS The latent variable model is conceptually simple and elegant; EOS yet requires sophisticated computational technique to approximate the integral over the latent variable. EOS We provide computational solutions using both the re-parameterization trick and also using the Bouchard bound for the softmax function, we further explore employing a variational auto-encoder and a variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm for tightening the variational bound. EOS The model performs well against a number of baselines. EOS The intuitive nature of the model allows an elegant formulation combining correlations between items and their popularity and that sheds light on other popular recommendation methods.	An attractive feature of the latent variable approach is that, as the user continues to act, the posterior on the user's state tightens reflecting the recommender system's increased knowledge about that user.
doc	Spectra of Discrete Schr\"odinger Operators with Primitive Invertible Substitution Potentials EOS We study the spectral properties of discrete Schr\"odinger operators with potentials given by primitive invertible substitution sequences (or by Sturmian sequences whose rotation angle has an eventually periodic continued fraction expansion, a strictly larger class than primitive invertible substitution sequences). EOS It is known that operators from this family have spectra which are Cantor sets of zero Lebesgue measure.	We show that the Hausdorff dimension of this set tends to _EQN_ as coupling constant _EQN_ tends to _EQN_.

doc	Printing-while-moving: a new paradigm for large-scale robotic 3D Printing EOS Building and Construction have recently become an exciting application ground for robotics. EOS In particular, rapid progress in materials formulation and in robotics technology has made robotic 3D Printing of concrete a promising technique for in-situ construction. EOS Yet, scalability remains an important hurdle to widespread adoption: the printing systems (gantry- based or arm-based) are often much larger than the structure to be printed, hence cumbersome. EOS Recently, a mobile printing system - a manipulator mounted on a mobile base - was proposed to alleviate this issue: such a system, by moving its base, can potentially print a structure larger than itself. EOS However, the proposed system could only print while being stationary, imposing thereby a limit on the size of structures that can be printed in a single take.	Here, we develop a system that implements the printing-while-moving paradigm, which enables printing single-piece structures of arbitrary sizes with a single robot.
doc	Soft Active Matter EOS In this review we summarize theoretical progress in the field of active matter, placing it in the context of recent experiments. EOS Our approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. EOS A major goal of the review is to integrate the several approaches proposed in the literature, from semi-microscopic to phenomenological. EOS In particular, we first consider "dry" systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium, and clarify the differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar. EOS We then consider the active hydrodynamics of a suspension, and relate as well as contrast it with the dry case. EOS We further highlight various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. EOS We discuss and connect various semi-microscopic derivations of the continuum theory, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. EOS Throughout the review, we discuss the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular materials. EOS We suggest promising extensions towards greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to ethology, and remark on some exotic active-matter analogues.	Lastly, we summarize the outlook for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or artificial constituents.

doc	An Orientifold with Fluxes and Branes via T-duality EOS String compactifications with non-abelian gauge fields localized on D-branes, with background NSNS and RR 3-form fluxes, and with non-trivial warp factors, can naturally exist within T-dual versions of type I string theory. EOS We develop a systematic procedure to construct the effective bosonic Lagrangian of type I T-dualized along a six-torus, including the coupling to gauge multiplets on D3-branes and the modifications due to 3-form fluxes. EOS Looking for solutions to the ten-dimensional equations of motion, we find warped products of Minkowski space and Ricci-flat internal manifolds. EOS Once the warp factor is neglected, the resulting no-scale scalar potential of the effective four-dimensional theory combines those known for 3-form fluxes and for internal Yang-Mills fields and stabilizes many of the moduli. EOS We perform an explicit comparison of our expressions to those obtained from N=4 gauged supergravity and find agreement.	We also comment on the possibility to include D9-branes with world-volume gauge fluxes in the background with 3-form fluxes.
doc	X-ray emission and the incidence of magnetic fields in the massive stars of the Orion Nebula Cluster EOS Magnetic fields have been frequently invoked as a likely source of variability and confinement of the winds of massive stars. EOS To date, the only magnetic field detected in O-type stars are those of theta 1 Ori C (HD 37022; EOS Donati et al 2002), the brightest and most massive member of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and HD 191612 (Donati et al 2006). EOS Notably, theta 1 Ori C is an intense X-ray emitter, and the source of these X-rays is thought to be strong shocks occurring in its magnetically-confined wind (Babel & Montmerle 1997a, Donati et al 2002). EOS Recently, Stelzer et al (2005) found significant X-ray emission from all massive stars in the ONC. EOS Periodic rotational modulation in X-rays and other indicators suggested that theta 1 Ori C may be but one of many magnetic B- and O-type stars in this star-forming region.	In 2005B we carried out sensitive ESPaDOnS observations to search for direct evidence of such fields, detecting unambiguous Zeeman signatures in two objects.

doc	The Shape of Data and Probability Measures EOS We introduce the notion of multiscale covariance tensor fields (CTF) associated with Euclidean random variables as a gateway to the shape of their distributions. EOS Multiscale CTFs quantify variation of the data about every point in the data landscape at all spatial scales, unlike the usual covariance tensor that only quantifies global variation about the mean. EOS Empirical forms of localized covariance previously have been used in data analysis and visualization, but we develop a framework for the systematic treatment of theoretical questions and computational models based on localized covariance. EOS We prove strong stability theorems with respect to the Wasserstein distance between probability measures, obtain consistency results, as well as estimates for the rate of convergence of empirical CTFs. EOS These results ensure that CTFs are robust to sampling, noise and outliers.	We provide numerous illustrations of how CTFs let us extract shape from data and also apply CTFs to manifold clustering, the problem of categorizing data points according to their noisy membership in a collection of possibly intersecting, smooth submanifolds of Euclidean space.

doc	Pix2Vex: Image-to-Geometry Reconstruction using a Smooth Differentiable Renderer EOS The long-coveted task of reconstructing 3D geometry from images is still a standing problem. EOS In this paper, we build on the power of neural networks and introduce Pix2Vex, a network trained to convert camera-captured images into 3D geometry. EOS We present a novel differentiable renderer (_EQN_) as a forward validation means during training. EOS Our key insight is that _EQN_ s produce images of a particular appearance, different from typical input images. EOS Hence, we propose adding an image-to-image translation component, converting between these rendering styles.	This translation closes the training loop, while allowing to use minimal supervision only, without needing any 3D model as ground truth.
doc	The signed enhanced principal rank characteristic sequence EOS The signed enhanced principal rank characteristic sequence (sepr-sequence) of an _EQN_ Hermitian matrix is the sequence _EQN_, where _EQN_ is either _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, or _EQN_ based on the following criteria: _EQN_ if _EQN_ has both a positive and a negative order- _EQN_ principal minor, and each order- _EQN_ principal minor is nonzero. EOS _EQN_ (respectively, _EQN_) if each order- _EQN_ principal minor is positive (respectively, negative). EOS _EQN_ if each order- _EQN_ principal minor is zero. EOS _EQN_ if _EQN_ has each a positive, a negative, and a zero order- _EQN_ principal minor. EOS _EQN_ (respectively, _EQN_) if _EQN_ has both a zero and a nonzero order- _EQN_ principal minor, and each nonzero order- _EQN_ principal minor is positive (respectively, negative). EOS Such sequences provide more information than the _EQN_ epr-sequence in the literature, where the _EQN_ th term is either _EQN_, _EQN_, or _EQN_ based on whether all, none, or some (but not all) of the order- _EQN_ principal minors of the matrix are nonzero. EOS Various sepr-sequences are shown to be unattainable by Hermitian matrices. EOS In particular, by applying Muir's law of extensible minors, it is shown that subsequences such as _EQN_ and _EQN_ are prohibited in the sepr-sequence of a Hermitian matrix. EOS For Hermitian matrices of orders _EQN_, all attainable sepr-sequences are classified.	For real symmetric matrices, a complete characterization of the attainable sepr-sequences whose underlying epr-sequence contains _EQN_ as a non-terminal subsequence is established.

EOS The affective understanding of conversations focuses on the problem of how speakers use emotions to react to a situation and to each other. EOS In the CL-Aff Shared Task, the organizers released Get it #OffMyChest dataset, which contains Reddit comments from casual and confessional conversations, labeled for their disclosure and supportiveness characteristics. EOS In this paper, we introduce a predictive ensemble model exploiting the finetuned contextualized word embeddings, RoBERTa and ALBERT.

We further conduct statistical analysis and outline deeper insights into the given dataset while providing a new characterization of impact for the dataset.
doc	Dust Scattering and the Radiation Pressure Force in the M82 Superwind EOS Radiation pressure on dust grains may be an important physical mechanism driving galaxy-wide superwinds in rapidly star-forming galaxies. EOS We calculate the combined dust and gas Eddington ratio (Gamma) for the archetypal superwind of M82. EOS By combining archival GALEX data, a standard dust model, Monte Carlo dust scattering calculations, and the Herschel map of the dust surface density distribution, the observed FUV/NUV surface brightness in the outflow constrains both the total UV luminosity escaping from the starburst along its minor axis (L_*, UV) and the flux-mean opacity, thus allowing a calculation of Gamma. EOS We find that L_(*, UV) ~ 1-6*10^42 ergs s^-1, ~2-12 times greater than the UV luminosity observed from our line of sight. EOS On a scale of 1-3 kpc above the plane of M82, we find that Gamma ~ 0.01 - 0.06. EOS On smaller scales (~0.25-0.5 kpc), where the enclosed mass decreases, our calculation of L_(*, UV) implies that Gamma ~ 0.1 with factor of few uncertainties. EOS Within the starburst itself, we estimate the single-scattering Eddington ratio to be of order unity.	Thus, although radiation pressure is weak compared to gravity on kpc scales above the plane of M82, it may yet be important in launching the observed outflow.

EOS Here, we present a quasilattice-conserved optimization method (quasiOPT), with particular quasiperiodic boundary conditions. EOS As the atomic coordinates described by basic cells and quasilattices, we are able to maintain the self-similarity characteristics of qusicrystals with the atomic structure of the boundary region updated timely following the relaxing region.	Exemplified with the study of decagonal Al-Co-Ni (d-Al-Co-Ni), we propose a more stable atomic structure model based on Penrose quasilattice and our quasiOPT simulations.

The presence of the topological term is due to the fact that _EQN_.
doc	Asymptotic of Approximate Least Squares Estimators of Parameters Two-Dimensional Chirp Signal EOS In this paper, we address the problem of parameter estimation of a 2-D chirp model under the assumption that the errors are stationary. EOS We extend the 2-D periodogram method for the sinusoidal model, to find initial values to use in any iterative procedure to compute the least squares estimators (LSEs) of the unknown parameters, to the 2-D chirp model. EOS Next we propose an estimator, known as the approximate least squares estimator (ALSE), that is obtained by maximising a periodogram-type function and is observed to be asymptotically equivalent to the LSE. EOS Moreover the asymptotic properties of these estimators are obtained under slightly mild conditions than those required for the LSEs. EOS For the multiple component 2-D chirp model, we propose a sequential method of estimation of the ALSEs, that significantly reduces the computational difficulty involved in reckoning the LSEs and the ALSEs.	We perform some simulation studies to see how the proposed method works and a data set has been analysed for illustrative purposes.
doc	Pitfalls of exergy analysis EOS The well-known Gouy-Stodola theorem states that a device produces maximum useful power when working reversibly, that is with no entropy production inside the device. EOS This statement then leads to a method of thermodynamic optimization based on entropy production minimization. EOS Exergy destruction (difference between exergy of fuel and exhausts) is also given by entropy production inside the device. EOS Therefore, assessing efficiency of a device by exergy analysis is also based on the Gouy-Stodola theorem. EOS However, assumptions that had led to the Gouy-Stodola theorem are not satisfied in several optimization scenarios, e.g. EOS non-isothermal steady-state fuel cells, where both entropy production minimization and exergy analysis should be used with caution.	We demonstrate, using non-equilibrium thermodynamics, a few cases where entropy production minimization and exergy analysis should not be applied.
doc	Visualization Framework for Colonoscopy Videos EOS We present a visualization framework for annotating and comparing colonoscopy videos, where these annotations can then be used for semi-automatic report generation at the end of the procedure. EOS Currently, there are approximately 14 million colonoscopies performed every year in the US. EOS In this work, we create a visualization tool to deal with the deluge of colonoscopy videos in a more effective way. EOS We present an interactive visualization framework for the annotation and tagging of colonoscopy videos in an easy and intuitive way.	These annotations and tags can later be used for report generation for electronic medical records and for comparison at an individual as well as group level.
doc	Optimization-based Decentralized Coded Caching for Files and Caches with Arbitrary Size EOS Existing decentralized coded caching solutions cannot guarantee small loads in the general scenario with arbitrary file sizes and cache sizes. EOS In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for decentralized coded caching in the general scenario to minimize the worst-case load and average load (under an arbitrary file popularity), respectively. EOS Specifically, we first propose a class of decentralized coded caching schemes for the general scenario, which are specified by a general caching parameter and include several known schemes as special cases. EOS Then, we optimize the caching parameter to minimize the worst-case load and average load, respectively. EOS Each of the two optimization problems is a challenging nonconvex problem with a nondifferentiable objective function. EOS For each optimization problem, we develop an iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point using techniques for solving Complementary Geometric Programming (GP).	We also obtain a low-complexity approximate solution by solving an approximate problem with a differentiable objective function which is an upper bound on the original nondifferentiable one, and characterize the performance loss caused by the approximation.
doc	Bounds on antipodal spherical designs with few angles EOS A finite subset _EQN_ on the unit sphere _EQN_ is called an _EQN_ -distance set with strength _EQN_ if its angle set _EQN_ has size _EQN_, and _EQN_ is a spherical _EQN_ -design but not a spherical _EQN_ -design.	In this paper, we consider to estimate the maximum size of such antipodal set for small _EQN_.
doc	One class of wild but brick-tame matrix problems EOS We present a class of wild matrix problems (representations of boxes), which are "brick-tame," i.e. EOS only have one-parameter families of ph bricks (representations with trivial endomorphism algebra).

doc	The CARMENES search for exoplanets around M dwarfs. Dynamical characterization of the multiple planet system GJ 1148 and prospects of habitable exomoons around GJ 1148 b EOS Context. EOS GJ 1148 is an M-dwarf star hosting a planetary system composed of two Saturn-mass planets in eccentric orbits with periods of 41.38 and 532.02 days. EOS Aims. EOS We reanalyze the orbital configuration and dynamics of the GJ 1148 multi-planetary system based on new precise radial velocity (RV) measurements taken with CARMENES. EOS Methods. EOS We combined new and archival precise Doppler measurements from CARMENES with those available from HIRES for GJ 1148 and modeled these data with a self-consistent dynamical model. EOS We studied the orbital dynamics of the system using the secular theory and direct N-body integrations. EOS The prospects of potentially habitable moons around GJ 1148 b were examined. EOS Results. EOS The refined dynamical analyses show that the GJ 1148 system is long-term stable in a large phase-space of orbital parameters with an orbital configuration suggesting apsidal alignment, but not in any particular high-order mean-motion resonant commensurability. EOS GJ 1148 b orbits inside the optimistic habitable zone (HZ). EOS We find only a narrow stability region around the planet where exomoons can exist.	However, in this stable region exomoons exhibit quick orbital decay due to tidal interaction with the planet.
doc	Thermal fluctuations and flux-tunable barrier in proximity Josephson junctions EOS The effect of thermal fluctuations in Josephson junctions is usually analysed using the Ambegaokar-Halperin (AH) theory in the context of thermal activation.

doc	Multi-Sparse Gaussian Process: Learning based Semi-Parametric Control EOS A key challenge with controlling complex dynamical systems is to accurately model them.

Data-driven approaches such as Gaussian processes (GPs) have proved quite effective by employing regression based methods to capture the unmodeled dynamical effects.
doc	Chiral oily streaks in a smectic-A liquid crystal EOS The liquid crystal octylcyanobiphenyl (8CB) was doped with the chiral agent CB15 and spin-coated onto a substrate treated for planar alignment of the director, resulting in a film of thickness several hundred nm in the smectic-A phase. EOS In both doped and undoped samples, the competing boundary conditions - planar alignment at the substrate and vertical alignment at the free surface - cause the liquid crystal to break into a series of flattened hemicylinders to satisfy the boundary conditions. EOS When viewed under an optical microscope with crossed polarizers, this structure results in a series of dark and light stripes ("oily streaks") of period ~ 1 _EQN_ m.	In the absence of chiral dopant the stripes run perpendicular to the substrate's easy axis.
doc	Probing the environment in Gamma-ray bursts: the case of an X-ray precursor, afterglow late onset and wind vs constant density profile in GRB011121 and GRB011211 EOS In this paper we present BeppoSax and XMM observations of two long Gamma-ray bursts, the X-ray rich event of December 11, 2001 (GRB011211) and the hard and very bright event of November 21, 2001 (GRB011121). EOS In both events we find evidence of a late X-ray burst, taking place several minutes after the prompt emission. EOS The temporal and spectral behaviour of this phenomenon suggest that it represents the onset of the afterglow. EOS Broad band spectral modelling of the afterglow indicate that the fireball evolution in the December burst takes place in a ISM environment. EOS On the contrary in the November burst the wind case is revealed by an X-ray decay slower than that observed in the optical (_EQN_ vs _EQN_). EOS The wind profile should change into a constant density profile at large radii, in order to reconcile late-time radio data with a jet. EOS Two other results are obtained for this burst.	An X-ray burst is preceding by about 30 s the much harder GRB.

doc	A Two-stage Stochastic Programming DSO Framework for Comprehensive Market Participation of DER Aggregators under Uncertainty EOS In this paper, a distribution system operator (DSO) framework is proposed for comprehensive retail and wholesale markets participation of distributed energy resource (DER) aggregators under uncertainty based on two-stage stochastic programming. EOS Different kinds of DER aggregators including energy storage aggregators (ESAGs), demand response aggregators (DRAGs), electric vehicle (EV) aggregating charging stations (EVCSs), dispatchable distributed generation (DDG) aggregators (DDGAGs), and renewable energy aggregators (REAGs) are modeled.

doc	Classical and quantum Chaplygin gas Ho\v r ava-Lifshitz scalar-metric cosmology EOS In this work, we study the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology in which a Chaplygin gas is coupled to a non-linear scalar field in the framework of the Ho\v r ava-Lifshitz theory. EOS In writing the action of the matter part, we use the Schutz's formalism so that the only degree of freedom of the Chaplygin gas plays the role of an evolutionary parameter. EOS In a minisuperspace perspective, we construct the Lagrangian for this model and show that in comparison with the usual Einstein-Hilbert gravity, there are some correction terms coming from the Ho\v r ava theory. EOS In such a set-up and by using of some approximations the classical dynamics of the model is investigated and some discussions about their possible singularities are presented.	We then deal with the quantization of the model in the context of the Wheeler-DeWitt approach of quantum cosmology to find the cosmological wave function.
doc	A fully end-to-end deep learning approach for real-time simultaneous 3D reconstruction and material recognition EOS This paper addresses the problem of simultaneous 3D reconstruction and material recognition and segmentation. EOS Enabling robots to recognise different materials (concrete, metal etc.) in a scene is important for many tasks, e.g. EOS robotic interventions in nuclear decommissioning. EOS Previous work on 3D semantic reconstruction has predominantly focused on recognition of everyday domestic objects (tables, chairs etc.), whereas previous work on material recognition has largely been confined to single 2D images without any 3D reconstruction. EOS Meanwhile, most 3D semantic reconstruction methods rely on computationally expensive post-processing, using Fully-Connected Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), to achieve consistent segmentations. EOS In contrast, we propose a deep learning method which performs 3D reconstruction while simultaneously recognising different types of materials and labelling them at the pixel level. EOS Unlike previous methods, we propose a fully end-to-end approach, which does not require hand-crafted features or CRF post-processing.	Instead, we use only learned features, and the CRF segmentation constraints are incorporated inside the fully end-to-end learned system.
doc	Allee dynamics: Growth, extinction and range expansion EOS In population biology, the Allee dynamics refer to negative growth rates below a critical population density. EOS In this Letter, we study a reaction-diffusion (RD) model of population growth and dispersion in one dimension, which incorporates the Allee effect in both the growth and mortality rates.	In the absence of diffusion, the bifurcation diagram displays regions of both finite population density and zero population density, i.e., extinction.
doc	On curves contained in convex subsets of the plane EOS If K' and K are convex bodies of the plane such that K' is a subset of K then the perimeter of K' is not greater than the perimeter of K. EOS We obtain the following generalization of this fact. EOS Let K be a convex compact body of the plane with the perimeter p and the diameter d and r>1 be an integer. EOS Let s be the smallest number such that for any curve of length greater than s contained in K there is a straight line intersecting the curve at least in r+1 different points.	Then s=rp/2 if r is even and s=(r-1)p/2+d if r is odd.

doc	LASSO-Driven Inference in Time and Space EOS We consider the estimation and inference in a system of high-dimensional regression equations allowing for temporal and cross-sectional dependency in covariates and error processes, covering rather general forms of weak temporal dependence. EOS A sequence of regressions with many regressors using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is applied for variable selection purpose, and an overall penalty level is carefully chosen by a block multiplier bootstrap procedure to account for multiplicity of the equations and dependencies in the data.	Correspondingly, oracle properties with a jointly selected tuning parameter are derived.

doc	Characterizing the deep uncertainties surrounding coastal flood hazard projections: A case study for Norfolk, VA EOS Coastal planners and decision makers design risk management strategies based on hazard projections. EOS However, projections can differ drastically. EOS What causes this divergence and which projection(s) should a decision maker adopt to create plans and adaptation efforts for improving coastal resiliency?	Using Norfolk, Virginia, as a case study, we start to address these questions by characterizing and quantifying the drivers of differences between published sea-level rise and storm surge projections, and how these differences can impact efforts to improve coastal resilience.
doc	Performance Analysis of MANET Routing Protocols Using An Elegant Visual Simulation Tool EOS The task of simulation is often complicated for which many naive users often seek for relatively easier solutions. EOS In many cases, simulations are done without any visual output which makes them non-attractive.

EOS ViSim could be useful for researchers, students, teachers in their works, and for the demonstration of various wireless network scenarios on computer screen.	It could make the task of simulation more exciting and enhance the interest of the users without going into complex command-only text interface.
doc	On the entanglement of formation of two-mode Gaussian states: a compact form EOS We define an EPR-like uncertainty by using the Duan et al's inequality which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of any two-mode Gaussian state. EOS We show that for a given amount of entanglement, the uncertainty is minimized by pure two-mode squeezed states. EOS Using this fact, we write the optimal pure-state decomposition and derive a compact form for the entanglement of formation of two-mode Gaussian states. EOS For illustration purposes, we consider symmetric and squeezed thermal states as special cases and evaluate their entanglement of formation explicitly. EOS For the symmetric states, our result is in agreement with the Giedke et al's one.	To our knowledge, our work is the first one which gives the exact entanglement of formation of two-mode squeezed thermal states explicitly.

doc	Indeterministic Quantum Gravity III. Gravidynamics versus Geometrodynamics: Revision of the Einstein Equation EOS This paper is a continuation of the papers [gr-qc/9409010, gr-qc/9505034]. EOS A revision of the Einstein equation shows that its dynamic incompleteness, contrary to a popular opinion, cannot be circumvented by so-called coordinate conditions. EOS Gravidynamics, i.e., dynamics for gravitational potentials _EQN_ is advanced, which differs from geometrodynamics of general relativity in that the former is based on a projected Einstein equation.	Cosmic gravidynamics, due to a global structure of spacetime, is complete.
doc	First-principles study of ternary graphite compounds cointercalated with alkali atoms (Li, Na, and K) and alkylamines towards alkali ion battery applications EOS Using density functional theory calculations, we have investigated the structural, energetic, and electronic properties of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) containing alkali atoms (AM) and normal alkylamine molecules (nC _EQN_), denoted as AM-nC _EQN_ -GICs (AM=Li, Na, K, _EQN_ =1, 2, 3, 4). EOS The orthorhombic unit cells have been used to build the models for crystalline stage-I AM-nC _EQN_ -GICs. EOS By performing the variable cell relaxations and the analysis of results, we have found that with the increase in the atomic number of alkali atoms the layer separations decreases in contrast to AM-GICs, while the bond lengths of alkali atoms with graphene layer and nitrogen atom of alkylamine decreases. EOS The formation and interlayer binding energies of AM-nC3-GICs have been calculated, indicating the increase in stability from Li to K. EOS The calculated energy barriers for migration of alkali atoms suggest that alkali cation with larger ionic radius diffuses in graphite more smoothly, being similar to AM-GICs.	The analysis of density of states, electronic density differences, and atomic populations illustrates a mechanism how the insertion of especially Na among alkali atoms into graphite with first stage can be made easy by cointercalation with alkylamine, more extent of electronic charge transfer is occurred from more electropositive alkali atom to carbon ring of graphene layer, while alkylamine molecules interact strongly with graphene layer through the hybridization of valence electron orbitals.

doc	AGN duty cycle estimates for the ultra-steep spectrum radio relic VLSS J1431.8+1331 EOS Steep spectrum radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN) may contain remnants of past AGN activity episodes. EOS Novel instruments like the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) are enabling studies of these fascinating structures to be made at tens to hundreds of MHz with sufficient resolution to analyse their complex morphology. EOS Our goal is to characterize the integrated and resolved spectral properties of VLSS J1431+1331 and estimate source ages based on synchrotron radio emission models, thus putting constraints on the AGN duty cycle. EOS Using a broad spectral coverage, we have derived spectral and curvature maps, and used synchrotron ageing models to determine the time elapsed from the last time the source plasma was energized.	We used LOFAR, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) data.
doc	Interactive Traceability Querying and Visualization for Coping With Development Complexity EOS Requirements traceability can in principle support stakeholders coping with rising development complexity. EOS However, studies showed that practitioners rarely use available traceability information after its initial creation. EOS In the position paper for the Dagstuhl seminar 1242, we argued that a more integrated approach allowing interactive traceability queries and context-specific traceability visualizations is needed to let practitioner access and use valuable traceability information.	The information retrieved via traceability can be very specific to a current task of a stakeholder, abstracting from everything that is not required to solve the task.
doc	The BeppoSAX broad-band spectrum and variability of the Seyfert 1 NGC 3783 EOS BeppoSAX observed the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783 for ~ 5 days from 1998 June 6 to 1998 June 10. EOS The average flux during the observation was F(2-10 keV) ~ 6 X 10^ -11 erg cm^-2 s^-1. EOS The long exposure provided a very high quality spectrum that exhibits all the typical features of Seyfert 1s. EOS The high energy cut-off of the intrinsic continuum, at E_c=340+560/-107 keV, was detected for the first time in this object. EOS During the observation the source showed modest flux variations (~ 20% in 2-10 keV) and spectral variability that can be completely explained by a change of the intrinsic slope \Delta\Gamma ~ 0.1. EOS NGC 3783 is one of the few Seyfert 1s that exhibits a soft emission component in the BeppoSAX spectrum. EOS This soft excess is well reproduced by a black body component with temperature kT ~ 0.2 keV. EOS A warm absorber is also required to fit the soft X-ray spectrum. EOS Both reprocessing features, the Compton reflection hump and the Fe emission line, were detected in our observation. EOS In addition to a narrow iron line (as observed by Chandra) a broad component with sigma=0.72 +1.28/-0.27 keV and EW=115+/-76 eV, is required to fit the line.	The observed Compton hump and the Fe line are well reproduced with the ionized (lg(xi)=2.73+0.04/-0.05) disc reflection model of Ross & Fabian.

Interstellar extinction toward the Cyg OB1 supershell EOS Two star-forming regions are studied: the young embedded open cluster vdB 130 and the protocluster neighbourhood observed in the head and tail of the cometary molecular cloud located in the wall of the expanding supershell surrounding the Cyg OB1 association. EOS The GAIA DR2 catalogue is employed to verify the stellar composition of the vdB 130 cluster whose members were earlier selected using the UCAC4 catalogue. EOS The new sample of vdB 130 members contains 68 stars with close proper motions (within 1 mas yr _EQN_) and close trigonometric parallaxes (ranging from 0.50 to 0.70 mas). EOS The relative parallax error is shown to increase with distance to objects and depend on their magnitude.	At a distance of 1.5-2 kpc it is of about 3-7 per cent and 20-30 per cent for bright and faint stars, respectively.
doc	Chiral transition temperature and aspects of deconfinement in 2+1 flavor QCD with the HISQ/tree action EOS We present results on the chiral transition temperature Tc in 2+1 flavor QCD extrapolated to the continuum limit and the physical light quark mass.

EOS The chiral transition is analyzed in terms of universal O(N) scaling functions.	After performing simultaneous asqtad and HISQ/tree continuum extrapolation the chiral transition temperature is Tc=154 +/- 9 MeV.
doc	Integrable time-dependent Hamiltonians, solvable Landau-Zener models and Gaudin magnets EOS We solve the non-stationary Schrodinger equation for several time-dependent Hamiltonians, such as the BCS Hamiltonian with an interaction strength inversely proportional to time, periodically driven BCS and linearly driven inhomogeneous Dicke models as well as various multi-level Landau-Zener tunneling models. EOS The latter are Demkov-Osherov, bow-tie, and generalized bow-tie models. EOS We show that these Landau-Zener problems and their certain interacting many-body generalizations map to Gaudin magnets in a magnetic field.	Moreover, we demonstrate that the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for the above models has a similar structure and is integrable with a similar technique as Knizhnikov-Zamolodchikov equations.

doc	Long range correlations in quantum gravity EOS Smolin has pointed out that the spin network formulation of quantum gravity will not necessarily possess the long range correlations needed for a proper classical limit; EOS typically, the action of the scalar constraint is too local. EOS Thiemann's length operator is used to argue for a further restriction on the action of the scalar constraint: it should not introduce new edges of color unity into a spin network, but should rather change preexisting edges by _EQN_ one unit of color. EOS Smolin has proposed a specific ansatz for a correlated scalar constraint. EOS This ansatz does not introduce color unity edges, but the [scalar, scalar] commutator is shown to be anomalous. EOS In general, it will be hard to avoid anomalies, once correlation is introduced into the constraint;	but it is argued that the scalar constraint may not need to be anomaly-free when acting on the kinematic basis.

EOS The influence of the hyperbolic structure of the model on the pattern formation as well as on the transient regimes is highlighted.	The theoretical predictions are illustrated on the hyperbolic Schnakenberg model and linear and weakly nonlinear stability are investigated both analytically and numerically.

doc	Refined Vertex Sparsifiers of Planar Graphs EOS We study the following version of cut sparsification. EOS Given a large edge-weighted network _EQN_ with _EQN_ terminal vertices, compress it into a smaller network _EQN_ with the same terminals, such that every minimum terminal cut in _EQN_ approximates the corresponding one in _EQN_, up to a factor _EQN_ that is called the quality. EOS (The case _EQN_ is known also as a mimicking network). EOS We provide new insights about the structure of minimum terminal cuts, leading to new results for cut sparsifiers of planar graphs. EOS Our first contribution identifies a subset of the minimum terminal cuts, which we call elementary, that generates all the others. EOS Consequently, _EQN_ is a cut sparsifier if and only if it preserves all the elementary terminal cuts (up to this factor _EQN_). EOS This structural characterization lead to improved bounds on the size of _EQN_. EOS For example, it improve the bound of mimicking-network size for planar graphs into a near-optimal one. EOS Our second and main contribution is to refine the known bounds in terms of _EQN_, which is defined as the minimum number of faces that are incident to all the terminals in a planar graph _EQN_. EOS We prove that the number of elementary terminal cuts is _EQN_ (compared to _EQN_ terminal cuts), and furthermore obtain a mimicking-network of size _EQN_, which is near-optimal as a function of _EQN_. EOS In the analysis we break the elementary terminal cuts into fragments, and count them carefully.	Our third contribution is a duality between cut sparsification and distance sparsification for certain planar graphs, when the sparsifier _EQN_ is required to be a minor of _EQN_.

EOS Therefore, we start making a comparison between this property and other notions of amenability for locally finite metric spaces that have been proposed by Gromov, Lafontaine and Pansu, by Ceccherini-Silberstein, Grigorchuk and de la Harpe and by Block and Weinberger.	We discuss possible applications of the property SN in the study of embedding a metric space into another one.

EOS For finite lattices, this problem shows three clearly different regimes, namely, nearly independent particles, highly interacting particles, and saturation. EOS The mean-square displacement of a tagged particle as a function of time follows a power law in each regime. EOS The first crossover time _EQN_, between the first and the second regime, depends on the particle density. EOS The other crossover time _EQN_, between the second and the third regime, depends on the lattice length. EOS We find analytic expressions for these dependencies and show how the general behavior can be characterized by an universal form. EOS We also show that the mean-square displacement of the center of mass presents two regimes;	anomalous diffusion for times shorter than _EQN_, and normal diffusion for times longer than _EQN_.
doc	One-channel conductor coupled to a quantum of resistance: exact ac conductance and finite-frequency noise EOS We consider a one-channel coherent conductor with a good transmission embedded into an ohmic environment whose impedance is equal to the quantum of resistance R_q=h/e^2 below the RC frequency. EOS This choice is motivated by the mapping of this problem to a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with one impurity whose interaction parameter corresponds to the specific value K=1/2, allowing for a refermionization procedure. EOS The "new" fermions have an energy-dependent transmission amplitude which incorporates the strong correlation effects and yields the exact dc current and zero-frequency noise through expressions similar to those of the scattering approach.	We recall and discuss these results for our present purpose.
doc	Sharp Load Thresholds for Cuckoo Hashing EOS The paradigm of many choices has influenced significantly the design of efficient data structures and, most notably, hash tables. EOS Cuckoo hashing is a technique that extends this concept. EOS There,we are given a table with _EQN_ locations, and we assume that each location can hold one item. EOS Each item to be inserted chooses randomly k>1 locations and has to be placed in any one of them. EOS How much load can cuckoo hashing handle before collisions prevent the successful assignment of the available items to the chosen locations? EOS Practical evaluations of this method have shown that one can allocate a number of elements that is a large proportion of the size of the table, being very close to 1 even for small values of k such as 4 or 5. EOS In this paper we show that there is a critical value for this proportion: with high probability, when the amount of available items is below this value, then these can be allocated successfully, but when it exceeds this value, the allocation becomes impossible.	We give explicitly for each k>1 this critical value.
doc	Ways of Applying Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering EOS As Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have become more powerful and easier to use they are increasingly deployed as key components of modern software systems. EOS While this enables new functionality and often allows better adaptation to user needs it also creates additional problems for software engineers and exposes companies to new risks. EOS Some work has been done to better understand the interaction between Software Engineering and AI but we lack methods to classify ways of applying AI in software systems and to analyse and understand the risks this poses.	Only by doing so can we devise tools and solutions to help mitigate them.
doc	Segmentation and Generation of Magnetic Resonance Images by Deep Neural Networks EOS Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) are extremely used in the medical field to detect and better understand diseases. EOS In order to fasten automatic processing of scans and enhance medical research, this project focuses on automatically segmenting targeted parts of MRIs and generating new MRI datasets from random noise.	More specifically, a Deep Neural Network architecture called U-net is used to segment bones and cartilages of Knee MRIs, and several Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are compared and tuned to create new realistic and high quality brain MRIs that can be used as training set for more advanced models.
doc	Electronic Ground State of Higher Acenes EOS We examine the electronic ground state of acenes with different number of fused benzene rings (up to 40) by using first principles density functional theory. EOS Their properties are compared with those of infinite polyacene. EOS We find that the ground state of acenes that consist of more than seven fused benzene rings is an antiferromagnetic (in other words, open-shell singlet) state, and we show that this singlet is not necessarily a diradical, because the spatially separated magnetizations for the spin-up and spin-down electrons increase with the size of the acene. EOS For example, our results indicate that there are about four spin-up electrons localized at one zigzag edge of 20-acene.	The reason that both acenes and polyacene have the antiferromagnetic ground state is due to the zigzag-shaped boundaries, which cause pi-electrons to localize and form spin orders at the edges.
doc	Thermal conductance of an Edge mode EOS Thermoelectric conductance of an edge mode is investigated. EOS The edge modes of a _EQN_ and _EQN_ two band model with parabolic dispersion is considered. EOS For the the one dimensional non interacting fermions the thermal conductivity computed agrees with the result known from _EQN_ computations. EOS In the presence of a magnetic field, backscattering is allowed and controls the value of the thermal conductivity.	The thermal conductivity is obtained from the continuity equation of thermal current energy conservation.

doc	Direct observations of magnetic flux rope formation during a solar coronal mass ejection EOS Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most spectacular eruptive phenomena in the solar atmosphere. EOS It is generally accepted that CMEs are results of eruptions of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs).	However, a heated debate is on whether MFRs pre-exist before the eruptions or they are formed during the eruptions.
doc	Andreev reflection at the edge of a two-dimentional semimetal EOS We investigate electron transport through the interface between a niobium superconductor and the edge of a two-dimensional semimetal, realized in a 20~nm wide HgTe quantum well. EOS Experimentally, we observe that typical behavior of a single Andreev contact is complicated by both a pronounced zero-bias resistance anomaly and shallow subgap resistance oscillations with _EQN_ periodicity. EOS These results are demonstrated to be independent of the superconducting material and should be regarded as specific to a 2D semimetal in a proximity with a superconductor.	We interpret these effects to originate from the Andreev-like correlated process at the edge of a two-dimensional semimetal.
doc	Detection and Study of High-Redshift Galaxies Through Cluster-Lenses EOS We discuss a method to build up and study a sample of distant galaxies, with 2<z<5, using the gravitational amplification effect in cluster-lenses for which the mass distribution is well known. EOS The candidates are selected close to the critical lines at high-z, through photometric redshift estimates on a large wavelength range.	With respect to other methods, this procedure allows to reduce the selection biases in luminosity, thanks to the cluster magnification of ~1 magnitude, and towards active SFRs when the near-IR domain is included.
doc	An algorithm to find the spectral radius of nonnegative tensors and its convergence analysis EOS In this paper we propose an iterative algorithm to find out the spectral radius of nonnegative tensors.

For nonnegative irreducible tensors, we establish the converges of the algorithm.
doc	Forward-Backward Asymmetries of Fourth Family Fermions Through the Z' Models at Linear Colliders EOS We investigate the forward-backward asymmetries in the pair production of fourth family fermions through the new Z' interactions in the e+e- collisions. EOS The Z' boson having family universal couplings can contribute to the pair production of fourth family fermions via the s-channel exchange. EOS The linear colliders will provide a clean environment for the physics of Z' boson to measure its couplings precisely. EOS The effects of the Z' boson to the asymmetries are shown to be important in some parameter regions for different Z' models. EOS Among these parameters, the invariant mass distribution m_FFbar will be an important measurement to constrain the Z' models.	Providing the fourth family fermion exist in an accesssible mass range, a chi^2 analysis can also be used to probe the Z' models at linear collider energies.
doc	Excitonic Effects in Two-Dimensional Massless Dirac Fermions EOS We study excitonic effects in two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions with Coulomb interactions by solving the ladder approximation to the Bethe-Salpeter equation. EOS It is found that the general 4-leg vertex has a power law behavior with the exponent going from real to complex as the coupling constant is increased. EOS This change of behavior is manifested in the antisymmetric response, which displays power law behavior at small wavevectors reminiscent of a critical state, and a change in this power law from real to complex that is accompanied by poles in the response function for finite size systems, suggesting a phase transition for strong enough interactions.	The density-density response is also calculated, for which no critical behavior is found.

doc	A non-CLP-compact product space whose finite subproducts are CLP-compact EOS We construct a family of Hausdorff spaces such that every finite product of spaces in the family (possibly with repetitions) is CLP-compact, while the product of all spaces in the family is non-CLP-compact.	Our example will yield a single Hausdorff space _EQN_ such that every finite power of _EQN_ is CLP-compact, while no infinite power of _EQN_ is CLP-compact.
doc	Relativistic outflow from two thermonuclear shell flashes on neutron stars EOS We study the exceptionally short (32-41 ms) precursors of two intermediate-duration thermonuclear X-ray bursts observed with RXTE from the neutron stars in 4U 0614+09 and 2S 0918-549. EOS They exhibit photon fluxes that surpass those at the Eddington limit later in the burst by factors of 2.6 to 3.1. EOS We are able to explain both the short duration and the super-Eddington flux by mildly relativistic outflow velocities of 0.1 _EQN_ to 0.3 _EQN_ subsequent to the thermonuclear shell flashes on the neutron stars.	These are the highest velocities ever measured from any thermonuclear flash.
doc	Recent results of the STAR high-energy polarized proton-proton program at RHIC at BNL EOS The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is carrying out a spin physics program colliding transverse or longitudinal polarized proton beams at _EQN_ GeV to gain a deeper insight into the spin structure and dynamics of the proton. EOS These studies provide fundamental tests of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). EOS One of the main objectives of the STAR spin physics program is the determination of the polarized gluon distribution function through a measurement of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, _EQN_, for various processes. EOS Recent results will be shown on the measurement of _EQN_ for inclusive jet production, neutral pion production and charged pion production at _EQN_ GeV.	In addition to these measurements involving longitudinal polarized proton beams, the STAR collaboration has performed several important measurements employing transverse polarized proton beams.

doc	Diagrammatic Inference EOS Diagrammatic logics were introduced in 2002, with emphasis on the notions of specifications and models. EOS In this paper we improve the description of the inference process, which is seen as a Yoneda functor on a bicategory of fractions.	A diagrammatic logic is defined from a morphism of limit sketches (called a propagator) which gives rise to an adjunction, which in turn determines a bicategory of fractions.
doc	Unequal Layer Densities in Bilayer Wigner Crystal at High Magnetic Field EOS We report studies of pinning mode resonances of magnetic field induced bilayer Wigner crystals of bilayer hole samples with negligible interlayer tunneling and different interlayer separations d, in states with varying layer densities, including unequal layer densities. EOS With unequal layer densities, samples with large d relative to the in-plane carrier-carrier spacing a, two pinning resonances are present, one for each layer. EOS For small d/a samples, a single resonance is observed even with significant density imbalance. EOS These samples, at balance, were shown to exhibit an enhanced pinning mode frequency [Zhihai Wang et al, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett.	136804 (2007)], which was ascribed to a one-component, pseudospin ferromagnetic Wigner solid.

doc	Fermion production from real-time lattice gauge theory in the classical-statistical regime EOS We investigate the real-time dynamics of U(1) and SU(N) gauge theories coupled to fermions on a lattice. EOS While real-time lattice gauge theory is not amenable to standard importance sampling techniques, for a large class of time-dependent problems the quantum dynamics can be accurately mapped onto a classical-statistical ensemble.	We illustrate the genuine quantum contributions included in this description by giving a diagrammatic representation in a series expansion.

doc	Smoothed Analysis of the Minimum-Mean Cycle Canceling Algorithm and the Network Simplex Algorithm EOS The minimum-cost flow (MCF) problem is a fundamental optimization problem with many applications and seems to be well understood. EOS Over the last half century many algorithms have been developed to solve the MCF problem and these algorithms have varying worst-case bounds on their running time. EOS However, these worst-case bounds are not always a good indication of the algorithms' performance in practice. EOS The Network Simplex (NS) algorithm needs an exponential number of iterations for some instances, but it is considered the best algorithm in practice and performs best in experimental studies. EOS On the other hand, the Minimum-Mean Cycle Canceling (MMCC) algorithm is strongly polynomial, but performs badly in experimental studies. EOS To explain these differences in performance in practice we apply the framework of smoothed analysis. EOS We show an upper bound of _EQN_ for the number of iterations of the MMCC algorithm. EOS Here _EQN_ is the number of nodes, _EQN_ is the number of edges, and _EQN_ is a parameter limiting the degree to which the edge costs are perturbed.	We also show a lower bound of _EQN_ for the number of iterations of the MMCC algorithm, which can be strengthened to _EQN_ when _EQN_.
doc	Measuring geometric phases with a dynamical quantum Zeno effect in a Bose-Einstein condensate EOS A closed-trajectory evolution of a quantum state generally imprints a phase that contains both dynamical and geometrical contributions. EOS While dynamical phases depend on the reference system, geometric phase factors are uniquely defined by the properties of the outlined trajectory. EOS Here, we generate and measure geometric phases in a Bose-Einstein condensate of _EQN_ Rb using a combination of dynamical quantum Zeno effect and measurement-free evolution.	We show that the dynamical quantum Zeno effect can inhibit the formation of a geometric phase without altering the dynamical phase.

At two loops this symbol can be uplifted to the full function in a unique way, without any beyond-the-symbol ambiguities.
doc	Sea of Genes: Combining Animation and Narrative Strategies to Visualize Metagenomic Data for Museums EOS We examine the application of narrative strategies to present a complex and unfamiliar metagenomics dataset to the public in a science museum. EOS Our dataset contains information about microbial gene expressions that scientists use to infer the behavior of microbes. EOS This exhibit had three goals: to inform (the) public about microbes' behavior, cycles, and patterns; EOS to link their behavior to the concept of gene expression; EOS and to highlight scientists' use of gene expression data to understand the role of microbes. EOS To address these three goals, we created a visualization with three narrative layers, each layer corresponding to a goal. EOS This study presented us with an opportunity to assess existing frameworks for narrative visualization in a naturalistic setting.	We present three successive rounds of design and evaluation of our attempts to engage visitors with complex data through narrative visualization.
doc	Reduced fusion systems over 2-groups of small order EOS We prove, when _EQN_ is a _EQN_ -group of order at most _EQN_, that each reduced fusion system over _EQN_ is the fusion system of a finite simple group and is tame.	It then follows that each saturated fusion system over a _EQN_ -group of order at most _EQN_ is realizable.

doc	Fast and direct visualization of piezo-generated charges at the nanoscale using direct piezoelectric force microscopy EOS The denominated surface charge scraping mechanism was discovered in 2014 by using a new Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) based mode called Charge Gradient Microscopy. EOS The measurements to probe such mechanism are achieved with the use of a current-to-voltage converter: a transimpedance amplifier (TIA). EOS However, the use of an incorrect approximation, named Gain BandWidth Product (GBWP) to calculate TIAs BandWidth (BW) could mislead to an incorrect data interpretation. EOS By measuring at higher frequencies than permitted, the amplifier is used as a current-to-voltage converter, in conditions where it behaves as a charge-to-voltage converter. EOS In this manuscript, we report the specific conditions in which the transfer function of the same electronic circuit topology is valid, while we spot both ringing and unstable amplifiers artifacts in the published data. EOS We finally perform physical measurements in similar conditions as reported, but fully respecting the BandWidth (BW) of the system. EOS We find that the charge collected is way below the values reported in such publication, diminishing or even nullifying the impact of a possible charge scrapping mechanism.	These findings pave the way to employ Direct Piezoelectric Force Microscopy (DPFM) as a fast ferroelectric nanoscale characterization tool.
doc	DOP: Deep Optimistic Planning with Approximate Value Function Evaluation EOS Research on reinforcement learning has demonstrated promising results in manifold applications and domains. EOS Still, efficiently learning effective robot behaviors is very difficult, due to unstructured scenarios, high uncertainties, and large state dimensionality (e.g. EOS multi-agent systems or hyper-redundant robots). EOS To alleviate this problem, we present DOP, a deep model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, which exploits action values to both (1) guide the exploration of the state space and (2) plan effective policies.	Specifically, we exploit deep neural networks to learn Q-functions that are used to attack the curse of dimensionality during a Monte-Carlo tree search.

Cloud-scale Gas Motions EOS Modern extragalactic molecular gas surveys now reach the scales of star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs, 20-50 pc).	Systematic variations in GMC properties with galaxy environment imply that clouds are not universally self-gravitating objects, decoupled from their surroundings.
doc	Simulating longitudinal data from marginal structural models using the additive hazard model EOS Observational longitudinal data on treatments and covariates are increasingly used to investigate treatment effects, but are often subject to time-dependent confounding. EOS Marginal structural models (MSMs), estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting or the g-formula, are popular for handling this problem. EOS With increasing development of advanced causal inference methods, it is important to be able to assess their performance in different scenarios to guide their application. EOS Simulation studies are a key tool for this, but their use to evaluate causal inference methods has been limited. EOS This paper focuses on the use of simulations for evaluations involving MSMs in studies with a time-to-event outcome. EOS In a simulation, it is important to be able to generate the data in such a way that the correct form of any models to be fitted to those data is known. EOS However, this is not straightforward in the longitudinal setting because it is natural for data to be generated in a sequential conditional manner, whereas MSMs involve fitting marginal rather than conditional hazard models. EOS We provide general results that enable the form of the correctly-specified MSM to be derived based on a conditional data generating procedure, and show how the results can be applied when the conditional hazard model is an Aalen additive hazard or Cox model. EOS Using conditional additive hazard models is advantageous because they imply additive MSMs that can be fitted using standard software. EOS We describe and illustrate a simulation algorithm.	Our results will help researchers to effectively evaluate causal inference methods via simulation.

doc	The inner kernel theorem for a certain Segal algebra EOS The Segal algebra _EQN_ is well defined for arbitrary locally compact Abelian Hausdorff (LCA) groups _EQN_. EOS Despite the fact that it is a Banach space it is possible to derive a kernel theorem similar to the Schwartz kernel theorem, of course without making use of the Schwartz kernel theorem. EOS First we characterize the bounded linear operators from _EQN_ to _EQN_ by distributions in _EQN_. EOS We call this the "outer kernel theorem". EOS The "inner kernel theorem" is concerned with the characterization of those linear operators which have kernels in the subspace _EQN_, the main subject of this manuscript. EOS We provide a description of such operators as regularizing operators in our context, mapping _EQN_ into test functions in _EQN_, in a _EQN_ -to norm continuous manner.	The presentation provides a detailed functional analytic treatment of the situation and applies to the case of general LCA groups, without recurrence to the use of so-called Wilson bases, which have been used for the case of elementary LCA groups.
doc	Trotter Derivation of Algorithms for Brownian and Dissipative Particle Dynamics EOS This paper focuses on the temporal discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and on different resulting numerical integration schemes. EOS Using a method based on the exponentiation of time dependent operators, we carefully derive a numerical scheme for the Langevin dynamics, that we found equivalent to the proposal of Ermak, and not simply to the stochastic version of the velocity-Verlet algorithm. EOS However, we checked on numerical simulations that both algorithms give similar results, and share the same ``weak order two'' accuracy.	We then apply the same strategy to derive and test two numerical schemes for the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD).
doc	Relativistic X-Ray Free Electron Lasers in the Quantum Regime EOS We present a nonlinear theory for relativistic X-ray free electron lasers in the quantum regime, using a collective Klein-Gordon (KG) equation (for relativistic electrons), which is coupled with the Maxwell-Poisson equations for the electromagnetic and electrostatic fields.	In our model, an intense electromagnetic wave is used as a wiggler which interacts with a relativistic electron beam to produce coherent tunable radiation.
doc	Modulation of pure spin currents with a ferromagnetic insulator EOS We propose and demonstrate spin manipulation by magnetically controlled modulation of pure spin currents in cobalt/copper lateral spin valves, fabricated on top of the magnetic insulator Y _EQN_ Fe _EQN_ O _EQN_ (YIG). EOS The direction of the YIG magnetization can be controlled by a small magnetic field. EOS We observe a clear modulation of the non-local resistance as a function of the orientation of the YIG magnetization with respect to the polarization of the spin current. EOS Such a modulation can only be explained by assuming a finite spin-mixing conductance at the Cu/YIG interface, as it follows from the solution of the spin-diffusion equation.	These results open a new path towards the development of spin logics.
doc	On Complexity of Isoperimetric Problems on Trees EOS This paper is aimed to investigate some computational aspects of different isoperimetric problems on weighted trees.

doc	Static quark-antiquark pairs at finite temperature EOS In a framework that makes close contact with modern effective field theories for non-relativistic bound states at zero temperature, we study the real-time evolution of a static quark-antiquark pair in a medium of gluons and light quarks at finite temperature. EOS For temperatures ranging from values larger to smaller than the inverse distance of the quark and antiquark, 1/r, and at short distances, we derive the potential between the two static sources, and calculate their energy and thermal decay width.	Two mechanisms contribute to the thermal decay width: the imaginary part of the gluon self energy induced by the Landau damping phenomenon, and the quark-antiquark color singlet to color octet thermal break up.
doc	Uniqueness Theorems for Meromorphic Mappings with Few Targets EOS The purpose of this article is to show uniqueness theorems for meromorphic mappings of C^m to CP^n with few hyperplanes H_j, j=1,...,q. EOS It is well known that uniqueness theorems hold for q \geq 3n+2. EOS In this paper we show that for every nonnegative integer c there exists a positive integer N(c), depending only on c in an explicit way, such that uniqueness theorems hold if q\geq (3n+2 -c) and n\geq N(c). EOS Furthermore, we also show that the coefficient of n in the formula of q can be replaced by a number which is strictly smaller than 3 for all n>>0.	At the same time, a big number of recent uniqueness theorems are generalized considerably.
doc	Dynamics of General Barotropic Stellar Fluid in the Framework of _EQN_ Gravity EOS Gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric homogeneous perfect barotropic fluid with linear as well as polytropic type Equation of State (EoS) has been investigated in the framework of a linear model of _EQN_ gravity. EOS This modified gravity has the potential to explain the observed cosmic acceleration. EOS The calculations have been done taking the transformed time coordinate _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the initial density of the fluid. EOS For linear EoS _EQN_, the condition for being a true singularity, along with sufficient condition for the formation of apparent horizon covering the singularity has been derived. EOS For a polytrope having the EoS _EQN_, the scale factor (_EQN_) as a function of fluid density (_EQN_) has been obtained which is then used to study the dynamics of the fluid. EOS Role of the polytropic index (_EQN_) and the constant of proportionality (_EQN_) in the dynamics of the fluid is also studied.	A new type of exotic matter field having varied dependence of scale factor on the density, and having the potential to give rise to bouncing cosmology, provided it is the dominating fluid in the universe, is obtained in this domain and is investigated.
doc	Noise-induced switching from a symmetry-protected shallow metastable state EOS We consider escape from a metastable state of a nonlinear oscillator driven close to triple its eigenfrequency. EOS The oscillator can have three stable states of period-3 vibrations and a zero-amplitude state. EOS Because of the symmetry of period-tripling, the zero-amplitude state remains stable as the driving increases. EOS However, it becomes shallow in the sense that the rate of escape from this state exponentially increases, while the system still lacks detailed balance. EOS We find the escape rate and show how it scales with the parameters of the oscillator and the driving. EOS The results facilitate using nanomechanical, Josephson-junction based, and other mesoscopic vibrational systems for studying, in a well-controlled setting, the rates of rare events in systems lacking detailed balance.	They also describe how fluctuations spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry of a driven oscillator.
doc	Hadron Resonance Gas with Repulsive Interactions and Fluctuations of Conserved Charges EOS We discuss the role of repulsive baryon-baryon interactions in a hadron gas using relativistic virial expansion and repulsive mean field approaches. EOS The fluctuations of the baryon number as well as strangeness-baryon correlations are calculated in the hadron resonance gas with repulsive interactions and compared with the recent lattice QCD results. EOS In particular, we calculate the difference between the second and fourth order fluctuations and correlations of baryon number and strangeness, that have been proposed as probes of deconfinement.	We show that for not too high temperatures these differences could be understood in terms of repulsive interactions.
doc	Magnetization and phase transition induced by circularly polarized laser in quantum magnets EOS We theoretically predict a nonequilibrium phase transition in quantum spin systems induced by a laser, which provides a purely quantum-mechanical way of coherently controlling magnetization. EOS Namely, when a circularly polarized laser is applied to a spin system, the magnetic component of a laser is shown to induce a magnetization normal to the plane of polarization, leading to an ultrafast phase transition. EOS We first demonstrate this phenomenon numerically for an _EQN_ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain, where a new state emerges with magnetization perpendicular to the polarization plane of the laser in place of the topologically ordered Haldane state.	We then elucidate its physical mechanism by mapping the system to an effective static model.
doc	Unsupervised Disaggregation of PhotoVoltaic Production from Composite Power Flow Measurements of Heterogeneous Prosumers EOS We consider the problem of estimating the unobserved amount of photovoltaic (PV) generation and demand in a power distribution network starting from measurements of the aggregated power flow at the point of common coupling (PCC) and local global horizontal irradiance (GHI). EOS The estimation principle relies on modeling the PV generation as a function of the measured GHI, enabling the identification of PV production patterns in the aggregated power flow measurements. EOS Four estimation algorithms are proposed: the first assumes that variability in the aggregated PV generation is given by variations of PV generation, the next two use a model of the demand to improve estimation performance, and the fourth assumes that, in a certain frequency range, the aggregated power flow is dominated by PV generation dynamics. EOS These algorithms leverage irradiance transposition models to explore several azimuth/tilt configurations and explain PV generation patterns from multiple plants with non-uniform installation characteristics.	Their estimation performance is compared and validated with measurements from a real-life setup including 4 houses with rooftop PV installations and battery systems for PV self-consumption.
doc	Properties of quasi-relaxed stellar systems in an external tidal field EOS In a previous paper, we have constructed a family of self-consistent triaxial models of quasi-relaxed stellar systems, shaped by the tidal field of the hosting galaxy, as an extension of the well-known spherical King models. EOS For a given tidal field, the models are characterized by two physical scales (such as total mass and central velocity dispersion) and two dimensionless parameters (the concentration parameter and the tidal strength). EOS The most significant departure from spherical symmetry occurs when the truncation radius of the corresponding spherical King model is of the order of the tidal radius, which, for a given tidal strength, is set by the maximum concentration value admitted. EOS For such maximally extended (or "critical") models the outer boundary has a generally triaxial shape, given by the zero-velocity surface of the relevant Jacobi integral, which is basically independent of the concentration parameter. EOS In turn, the external tidal field can give rise to significant global departures from spherical symmetry (as measured, for example, by the quadrupole of the mass distribution of the stellar system) only for low-concentration models, for which the allowed maximal value of the tidal strength can be relatively high. EOS In this paper we describe in detail the intrinsic and the projected structure and kinematics of the models, covering the entire parameter space, from the case of sub-critical (characterized by "underfilling" of the relevant Roche volume) to that of critical models. EOS The intrinsic properties can be a useful starting point for numerical simulations and other investigations that require initialization of a stellar system in dynamical equilibrium.	The projected properties are a key step in the direction of a comparison with observed globular clusters and other candidate stellar systems.
doc	Large-time evolution of electron in photon bath EOS The problem of infrared divergence of the effective electromagnetic field produced by elementary charges is revisited using the model of an electron freely evolving in a photon bath.	It is shown that for any finite travel time, the effective field of the electron is infrared-finite, and that in each order of perturbation theory the radiative contributions grow without bound in the large-time limit.
doc	Multilevel Monte Carlo Simulations of Composite Structures with Uncertain Manufacturing Defects EOS By adopting a Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) framework, we show that only a handful of costly fine scale computations are needed to accurately estimate statistics of the failure of a composite structure, as opposed to the thousands typically needed in classical Monte Carlo analyses. EOS We introduce the MLMC method, compare its theoretical complexity with classical Monte Carlo, and give a simple-to-implement algorithm which includes a simple extension called MLMC with selective refinement to efficiently calculated structural failure probabilities.	To demonstrate the huge computational gains we present two benchmark problems in composites: (1) the effects of fibre waviness on the compressive strength of a composite material, (2) uncertain buckling performance of a composite panel with uncertain ply orientations.

EOS Will the chiral approach offer a framework where fitting and selecting the existing np and pp data can be done without theoretical bias? EOS.	While predictive power in theoretical nuclear physics has been a major concern in the study of nuclear structure and reactions, the Effective Field Theory (EFT) based on chiral expansions has emerged after Weinberg as a model independent hierarchy for many body forces and much progress has been achieved over the last decades.
doc	Gaia unveils the kinematics of multiple stellar populations in 47 Tucanae EOS The series of events, which occurred at high redshift and originated multiple stellar populations in Globular Clusters (GCs) are still poorly understood. EOS Theoretical work suggests that the present-day dynamics of stars in nearby GCs, including the rotation and velocity dispersion, may retain important clues on the formation of multiple populations. EOS So far, the dynamics of multiple populations have been investigated either from radial velocities of a relatively-small sample of stars, or from relative proper motions of stars in the small field of view provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.	In this context, Gaia provides the unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of thousands GC stars over a wide field of view.

doc	A Retrodirective Wireless Power Transfer Scheme for Ambient Backscatter Systems EOS One of the key challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT) is to sustainably power the large number of IoT devices in real-time. EOS In this paper, we consider a wireless power transfer (WPT) scenario between an energy transmitter (ET) capable of retrodirective WPT and an energy receiver (ER) capable of ambient backscatter in the presence of an ambient source (AS). EOS The ER requests WPT by backscattering signals from an AS towards the ET, which then retrodirectively beamforms an energy signal towards the ER.	To remove the inherent direct-link ambient interference, we propose a scheme of ambient backscatter training.
doc	Crowds on Wall Street: Extracting Value from Social Investing Platforms EOS For decades, the world of financial advisors has been dominated by large investment banks such as Goldman Sachs. EOS In recent years, user-contributed investment services such as SeekingAlpha and StockTwits have grown to millions of users. EOS In this paper, we seek to understand the quality and impact of content on social investment platforms, by empirically analyzing complete datasets of SeekingAlpha articles (9 years) and StockTwits messages (4 years). EOS We develop sentiment analysis tools and correlate contributed content to the historical performance of relevant stocks.	While SeekingAlpha articles and StockTwits messages provide minimal correlation to stock performance in aggregate, a subset of authors contribute more valuable (predictive) content.
doc	Spacecraft Tracking Applications of the Square Kilometre Array EOS The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is the next generation radio telescope distinguished by a superb sensitivity due to its large aperture (about one square kilometre) and advanced instrumentation. EOS It will cover a broad range of observing bands including those used for tracking of and communications to deep space missions. EOS While spacecraft tracking is not a main application defining the technical specifications of the SKA, this facility might play a role in tracking deep space probes as a backup to the ``dedicated'' deep space tracking networks. EOS This paper presents possible applications of the SKA as a deep space tracking facility and major related technical specifications of various concepts of the SKA. EOS It was presented at the 3rd International Workshop on Tracking, Telemetry and Command Systems for Space Applications, ESA-ESOC, Darmstadt, Germany, 7-9 September 2004.	Over the past years, the SKA concept has developed to a much higher level of detalisation and is currently at the implementation phase.
doc	Generalized Weierstrass Relations and Frobenius reciprocity EOS This article investigates local properties of the further generalized Weierstrass relations for a spin manifold _EQN_ immersed in a higher dimensional spin manifold _EQN_ from viewpoint of study of submanifold quantum mechanics. EOS We show that kernel of a certain Dirac operator defined over _EQN_, which we call submanifold Dirac operator, gives the data of the immersion.	In the derivation, the simple Frobenius reciprocity of Clifford algebras _EQN_ and _EQN_ plays important roles.

doc	Analysing user identity via time-sensitive semantic edit distance (t-SED): A case study of Russian trolls on Twitter EOS In the digital era, individuals are increasingly profiled and grouped based on the traces they leave behind in online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. EOS In this paper, we develop and evaluate a novel text analysis approach for studying user identity and social roles by redefining identity as a sequence of timestamped items (e.g. EOS tweet texts). EOS We operationalise this idea by developing a novel text distance metric, the time-sensitive semantic edit distance (t-SED), which accounts for the temporal context across multiple traces. EOS To evaluate this method we undertake a case study of Russian online-troll activity within US political discourse. EOS The novel metric allows us to classify the social roles of trolls based on their traces, in this case tweets, into one of the predefined categories left-leaning, right-leaning, and news feed.	We show the effectiveness of the t-SED metric to measure the similarities between tweets while accounting for the temporal context, and we use novel data visualisation techniques and qualitative analysis to uncover new empirical insights into Russian troll activity that have not been identified in previous work.
doc	High Redshift Intergalactic C IV Abundance Measurements from the Near-Infrared Spectra of Two z~6 QSOs EOS New measurements of the z~6 intergalactic CIV abundance are presented, using moderate resolution IR spectra of two QSOs taken with GNIRS on Gemini South. EOS These data were systematically searched for high redshift CIV absorption lines, using objective selection criteria. EOS Comprehensive tests were performed to quantify sample incompleteness, as well as the rate of false positive CIV identifications. EOS The trend of constant _EQN_ observed at z~2-5 appears to continue to z~6, the highest observed redshift. EOS The CIV sample is also consistent with the redshift-invariant form of the CIV column density distribution reported by Songaila (2001) at lower redshift, although with fairly large uncertainties due to a smaller sample size and noisier infrared data. EOS The constant value of _EQN_ does not necessarily imply that the IGM was infused with an early metallicity ``floor,'' but the presence of early CIV does indicate that heavy-element enrichment began < 1 Gyr after the Big Bang.	The lack of a decline in _EQN_ at high redshift may indicate that integrated CIV measurements are sensitive to the instantaneous rate of feedback from galaxy formation at each epoch.
doc	The role of cosmic ray pressure in accelerating galactic outflows EOS We study the formation of galactic outflows from supernova explosions (SNe) with the moving-mesh code AREPO in a stratified column of gas with a surface density similar to the Milky Way disk at the solar circle. EOS We compare different simulation models for SNe placement and energy feedback, including cosmic rays (CR), and find that models that place SNe in dense gas and account for CR diffusion are able to drive outflows with similar mass loading as obtained from a random placement of SNe with no CRs. EOS Despite this similarity, CR-driven outflows differ in several other key properties including their overall clumpiness and velocity.	Moreover, the forces driving these outflows originate in different sources of pressure, with the CR diffusion model relying on non-thermal pressure gradients to create an outflow driven by internal pressure and the random-placement model depending on kinetic pressure gradients to propel a ballistic outflow.

Doppler tracking: Formulation of observed and computed values, and noise budget EOS Context. EOS Closed-loop Doppler data obtained by deep space tracking networks (e.g., NASA's DSN and ESA's Estrack) are routinely used for navigation and science applications. EOS By "shadow tracking" the spacecraft signal, Earth-based radio telescopes involved in Planetary Radio Interferometry and Doppler Experiment (PRIDE) can provide open-loop Doppler tracking data when the dedicated deep space tracking facilities are operating in closed-loop mode only.

doc	Large deviation principles for the Ewens-Pitman sampling model EOS Let _EQN_ be the number of blocks with frequency _EQN_ in the exchangeable random partition induced by a sample of size _EQN_ from the Ewens-Pitman sampling model. EOS We show that, as _EQN_ tends to infinity, _EQN_ satisfies a large deviation principle and we characterize the corresponding rate function. EOS A conditional counterpart of this large deviation principle is also presented. EOS Specifically, given an initial sample of size _EQN_ from the Ewens-Pitman sampling model, we consider an additional sample of size _EQN_. EOS For any fixed _EQN_ and as _EQN_ tends to infinity, we establish a large deviation principle for the conditional number of blocks with frequency _EQN_ in the enlarged sample, given the initial sample. EOS Interestingly, the conditional and unconditional large deviation principles coincide, namely there is no long lasting impact of the given initial sample.	Potential applications of our results are discussed in the context of Bayesian nonparametric inference for discovery probabilities.
doc	Parameter-free effective field theory calculation for the solar proton-fusion and hep processes EOS Spurred by the recent complete determination of the weak currents in two-nucleon systems up to _EQN_ in heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory, we carry out a parameter-free calculation of the threshold _EQN_ -factors for the solar _EQN_ (proton-fusion) and _EQN_ processes in an effective field theory that combines the merits of the standard nuclear physics method and systematic chiral expansion.	The power of the EFT adopted here is that one can correlate in a unified formalism the weak-current matrix elements of two-, three- and four-nucleon systems.
doc	Phase behaviour of deionized binary mixtures of charged colloidal spheres EOS We review recent work on the phase behaviour of binary charged sphere mixtures as a function of particle concentration and composition. EOS Both size ratios and charge ratios are varied over a wide range. EOS By contrast to hard spheres the long ranged Coulomb interaction stabilizes the crystal phase at low particle concentrations and shifts the occurrence of amorphous solids to particle concentrations considerably larger than the freezing concentration. EOS Depending on size- and charge ratios we observe upper azeotrope, spindle, lower azeotrope and eutectic types of phase diagrams, all known well from metal systems.	Most solids are of body centred cubic structure.
doc	Anomaly Detection-Based Unknown Face Presentation Attack Detection EOS Anomaly detection-based spoof attack detection is a recent development in face Presentation Attack Detection (fPAD), where a spoof detector is learned using only non-attacked images of users. EOS These detectors are of practical importance as they are shown to generalize well to new attack types. EOS In this paper, we present a deep-learning solution for anomaly detection-based spoof attack detection where both classifier and feature representations are learned together end-to-end. EOS First, we introduce a pseudo-negative class during training in the absence of attacked images. EOS The pseudo-negative class is modeled using a Gaussian distribution whose mean is calculated by a weighted running mean. EOS Secondly, we use pairwise confusion loss to further regularize the training process. EOS The proposed approach benefits from the representation learning power of the CNNs and learns better features for fPAD task as shown in our ablation study.	We perform extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets: Replay-Attack, Rose-Youtu, OULU-NPU and Spoof in Wild to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the previous methods.
doc	A search for pulsational line profile variations in the delta Scuti star HD21190 and the Ap Sr star HD218994 EOS We present the results of our recent search for pulsational line profile variations in high time resolution UVES spectra of the most evolved Ap star known, the delta Scuti star HD21190, and of the Ap Sr star HD218994. EOS We found that HD218994 is an roAp star with a pulsation period of 5.1 min, which makes it the 36th star known to be a roAp star. EOS No rapid pulsations have been found in the spectra of the delta Scuti star HD21190.	However, we detect moving peaks in the cores of spectral lines, which indicate the presence of non-radial pulsations in this star.

doc	Cubic Differentials in the Differential Geometry of Surfaces EOS We discuss the local differential geometry of convex affine spheres in _EQN_ and of minimal Lagrangian surfaces in Hermitian symmetric spaces. EOS In each case, there is a natural metric and cubic differential holomorphic with respect to the induced conformal structure: these data come from the Blaschke metric and Pick form for the affine spheres and from the induced metric and second fundamental form for the minimal Lagrangian surfaces.	The local geometry, at least for main cases of interest, induces a natural frame whose structure equations arise from the affine Toda system for _EQN_.
doc	String Scattering Amplitudes and Deformed Cubic String Field Theory EOS We study string scattering amplitudes by using the deformed cubic string field theory which is equivalent to the string field theory in the proper-time gauge. EOS The four-string scattering amplitudes with three tachyons and an arbitrary string state are calculated. EOS The string field theory yields the string scattering amplitudes evaluated on the world sheet of string scattering whereas the coventional method, based on the first quantized theory brings us the string scattering amplitudes defined on the upper half plane. EOS For the highest spin states, generated by the primary operators, both calculations are in perfect agreement. EOS In this case, the string scattering amplitudes are invariant under the conformal transformation, which maps the string world sheet onto the upper half plane. EOS If the external string states are general massive states, generated by non-primary field operators, we need to take into account carefully the conformal transformation between the world sheet and the upper half plane.	We show by an explicit calculation that the string scattering amplitudes calculated by using the deformed cubic string field theory transform into those of the first quantized theory on the upper half plane by the conformal transformation, generated by the Schwarz-Christoffel mapping.

doc	Self-supervised 6D Object Pose Estimation for Robot Manipulation EOS To teach robots skills, it is crucial to obtain data with supervision. EOS Since annotating real world data is time-consuming and expensive, enabling robots to learn in a self-supervised way is important. EOS In this work, we introduce a robot system for self-supervised 6D object pose estimation. EOS Starting from modules trained in simulation, our system is able to label real world images with accurate 6D object poses for self-supervised learning. EOS In addition, the robot interacts with objects in the environment to change the object configuration by grasping or pushing objects.	In this way, our system is able to continuously collect data and improve its pose estimation modules.
doc	Unconventional singularities and frictional rupture energy budget EOS A widespread framework for understanding frictional rupture, such as earthquakes along geological faults, invokes an analogy to ordinary cracks. EOS In ordinary cracks, near rupture edge fields feature a conventional square root singularity, accompanied by an associated edge-localized energy balance. EOS It has been recently demonstrated that this analogy holds to a very good approximation, yet that overall rupture (earthquake) energy budget includes also a significant non-edge-localized excess frictional dissipation, which is predicted to vanish in the crack analogy. EOS We develop a macroscopic theory that address these puzzling observations and fully resolves the apparent contradiction. EOS The theory identifies a "hidden" small parameter, which quantifies the deviation from a conventional singular behavior of near-edge fields, and predicts non-edge-localized excess frictional dissipation that is dominated by an accumulated spatially-extended contribution.	The latter, which is also position dependent, is associated with the generic rate-dependent nature of friction and compensates the aforementioned smallness.
doc	Origin Scenarios for the Kepler 36 Planetary System EOS We explore scenarios for the origin of two different density planets in the Kepler 36 system in adjacent orbits near the 7:6 mean motion resonance. EOS We find that fine tuning is required in the stochastic forcing amplitude, the migration rate and planet eccentricities to allow two convergently migrating planets to bypass mean motion resonances such as the 4:3, 5:4 and 6:5, and yet allow capture into the 7:6 resonance. EOS Stochastic forcing can eject the system from resonance causing a collision between the planets, unless the disk inducing migration and stochastic forcing is depleted soon after resonance capture. EOS We explore a scenario with approximately Mars mass embryos originating exterior to the two planets and migrating inwards toward two planets. EOS We find that gravitational interactions with embryos can nudge the system out of resonances. EOS Numerical integrations with about a half dozen embryos can leave the two planets in the 7:6 resonance. EOS Collisions between planets and embryos have a wide distribution of impact angles and velocities ranging from accretionary to disruptive. EOS We find that impacts can occur at sufficiently high impact angle and velocity that the envelope of a planet could have been stripped, leaving behind a dense core.	Some of our integrations show the two planets exchanging locations, allowing the outer planet that had experienced multiple collisions with embryos to become the innermost planet.

doc	Machine Learning Based Real Bogus System for HSC-SSP Moving Object Detecting Pipeline EOS Machine learning techniques are widely applied in many modern optical sky surveys, e.q. EOS Pan-STARRS1, PTF/iPTF and Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, to reduce human intervention for data verification. EOS In this study, we have established a machine learning based real-bogus system to reject the false detections in the Subaru/Hyper-Suprime-Cam StrategicSurvey Program (HSC-SSP) source catalog. EOS Therefore the HSC-SSP moving object detection pipeline can operate more effectively due to the reduction of false positives.	To train the real-bogus system, we use the stationary sources as the real training set and the "flagged" data as the bogus set.
doc	Large deviation function of a tracer position in single file diffusion EOS Diffusion of impenetrable particles in a crowded one-dimensional channel is referred as the single file diffusion. EOS The particles do not pass each other and the displacement of each individual particle is sub-diffusive. EOS We analyse a simple realization of this single file diffusion problem where one dimensional Brownian point particles interact only by hard-core repulsion. EOS We show that the large deviation function which characterizes the displacement of a tracer at large time can be computed via a mapping to a problem of non-interacting Brownian particles. EOS We confirm recently obtained results of the one time distribution of the displacement and show how to extend them to the multi-time correlations. EOS The probability distribution of the tracer position depends on whether we take annealed or quenched averages. EOS In the quenched case we notice an exact relation between the distribution of the tracer and the distribution of the current.	This relation is in fact much more general and would be valid for arbitrary single file diffusion.
doc	A Dataset of Laryngeal Endoscopic Images with Comparative Study on Convolution Neural Network Based Semantic Segmentation EOS Purpose Automated segmentation of anatomical structures in medical image analysis is a prerequisite for autonomous diagnosis as well as various computer and robot aided interventions. EOS Recent methods based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed former heuristic methods. EOS However, those methods were primarily evaluated on rigid, real-world environments. EOS In this study, existing segmentation methods were evaluated for their use on a new dataset of transoral endoscopic exploration. EOS Methods Four machine learning based methods SegNet, UNet, ENet and ErfNet were trained with supervision on a novel 7-class dataset of the human larynx. EOS The dataset contains 536 manually segmented images from two patients during laser incisions. EOS The Intersection-over-Union (IoU) evaluation metric was used to measure the accuracy of each method. EOS Data augmentation and network ensembling were employed to increase segmentation accuracy. EOS Stochastic inference was used to show uncertainties of the individual models.	Patient-to-patient transfer was investigated using patient-specific fine-tuning.
doc	Minimax experimental design: Bridging the gap between statistical and worst-case approaches to least squares regression EOS In experimental design, we are given a large collection of vectors, each with a hidden response value that we assume derives from an underlying linear model, and we wish to pick a small subset of the vectors such that querying the corresponding responses will lead to a good estimator of the model. EOS A classical approach in statistics is to assume the responses are linear, plus zero-mean i.i.d. EOS Gaussian noise, in which case the goal is to provide an unbiased estimator with smallest mean squared error (A-optimal design). EOS A related approach, more common in computer science, is to assume the responses are arbitrary but fixed, in which case the goal is to estimate the least squares solution using few responses, as quickly as possible, for worst-case inputs. EOS Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two approaches has proven elusive. EOS We address this by proposing a framework for experimental design where the responses are produced by an arbitrary unknown distribution. EOS We show that there is an efficient randomized experimental design procedure that achieves strong variance bounds for an unbiased estimator using few responses in this general model. EOS Nearly tight bounds for the classical A-optimality criterion, as well as improved bounds for worst-case responses, emerge as special cases of this result. EOS In the process, we develop a new algorithm for a joint sampling distribution called volume sampling, and we propose a new i.i.d. EOS importance sampling method: inverse score sampling. EOS A key novelty of our analysis is in developing new expected error bounds for worst-case regression by controlling the tail behavior of i.i.d. EOS sampling via the jointness of volume sampling.	Our result motivates a new minimax-optimality criterion for experimental design which can be viewed as an extension of both A-optimal design and sampling for worst-case regression.
doc	A ReRAM Physically Unclonable Function (ReRAM PUF)-based Approach to Enhance Authentication Security in Software Defined Wireless Networks EOS The exponentially increasing number of ubiquitous wireless devices connected to the Internet in Internet of Things (IoT) networks highlights the need for a new paradigm of data flow management in such large-scale networks under software defined wireless networking (SDWN). EOS The limited power and computation capability available at IoT devices as well as the centralized management and decision-making approach in SDWN introduce a whole new set of security threats to the networks. EOS In particular, the authentication mechanism between the controllers and the forwarding devices in SDWNs is a key challenge from both secrecy and integrity aspects. EOS Conventional authentication protocols based on public key infrastructure (PKI) are no longer sufficient for these networks considering the large-scale and heterogeneity nature of the networks as well as their deployment cost, and security vulnerabilities due to key distribution and storage. EOS We propose a novel security protocol based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) known as hardware security primitives to enhance the authentication security in SDWNs. EOS In this approach, digital PUFs are developed using the inherent randomness of the nanomaterials of Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) that are embedded in most IoT devices to enable a secure authentication and access control in these networks.	These PUFs are developed based on a novel approach of multi-states, in which the natural drifts due to the physical variations in the environment are predicted to reduce the potential errors in challenge-response pairs of PUFs being tested in different situations.
doc	RAPTOR I: Time-dependent radiative transfer in arbitrary spacetimes EOS Observational efforts to image the immediate environment of a black hole at the scale of the event horizon benefit from the development of efficient imaging codes that are capable of producing synthetic data, which may be compared with observational data. EOS We aim to present RAPTOR, a new public code that produces accurate images, animations, and spectra of relativistic plasmas in strong gravity by numerically integrating the equations of motion of light rays and performing time-dependent radiative transfer calculations along the rays. EOS The code is compatible with any analytical or numerical spacetime. EOS It is hardware-agnostic and may be compiled and run both on GPUs and CPUs. EOS We describe the algorithms used in RAPTOR and test the code's performance.	We have performed a detailed comparison of RAPTOR output with that of other radiative-transfer codes and demonstrate convergence of the results.
doc	A numerical algorithm for _EQN_ semi-discrete optimal transport in 3D EOS This paper introduces a numerical algorithm to compute the _EQN_ optimal transport map between two measures _EQN_ and _EQN_, where _EQN_ derives from a density _EQN_ defined as a piecewise linear function (supported by a tetrahedral mesh), and where _EQN_ is a sum of Dirac masses. EOS I first give an elementary presentation of some known results on optimal transport and then observe a relation with another problem (optimal sampling). EOS This relation gives simple arguments to study the objective functions that characterize both problems. EOS I then propose a practical algorithm to compute the optimal transport map between a piecewise linear density and a sum of Dirac masses in 3D. EOS In this semi-discrete setting, Aurenhammer et.al [ ph 8th Symposium on Computational Geometry conf. EOS proc.	, ACM (1992)] showed that the optimal transport map is determined by the weights of a power diagram.
doc	Radiative association of C(_EQN_) and H _EQN_: Triplet states EOS The radiative association of C(_EQN_) and H _EQN_ is investigated by calculating cross sections for photon emission into bound ro-vibrational states of CH _EQN_ from the vibrational continua of initial triplet d _EQN_ or b _EQN_ states. EOS Potential energy curves and transition dipole moments are calculated using multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) methods with AV6Z basis sets. EOS The cross sections are evaluated using quantum-mechanical methods and rate coefficients are calculated.	The rate coefficients are about 100 times larger than those for radiative association of C _EQN_ and H from the A _EQN_ state.

doc	Can the Utility of Anonymized Data be used for Privacy Breaches? EOS Group based anonymization is the most widely studied approach for privacy preserving data publishing. EOS This includes k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness, to name a few. EOS The goal of this paper is to raise a fundamental issue on the privacy exposure of the current group based approach. EOS This has been overlooked in the past. EOS The group based anonymization approach basically hides each individual record behind a group to preserve data privacy. EOS If not properly anonymized, patterns can actually be derived from the published data and be used by the adversary to breach individual privacy. EOS For example, from the medical records released, if patterns such as people from certain countries rarely suffer from some disease can be derived, then the information can be used to imply linkage of other people in an anonymized group with this disease with higher likelihood.	We call the derived patterns from the published data the foreground knowledge.
doc	Simple Refutation of the Eppley-Hannah argument EOS In an influential paper, Eppley and Hannah argued that gravity must necessarily be quantized, by proposing a thought experiment involving classical gravitational waves interacting with quantum matter. EOS They argue the interaction must either violate the uncertainty principle or allow superluminal signalling. EOS The feasibility of implementing their experiment in our universe has been challenged by Mattingly, and other limitations of the argument have been noted by Huggett and Callender and by Albers et al.	However, these critiques do not directly refute the claim that coupling quantum theories with a Copenhagen collapse postulate to unentanglable classical gravitational degrees of freedom leads to contradiction.

EOS We confirm that X-ray emission is associated with two of three mass concentrations identified in previous gravitational lensing studies of this object.	These two mass concentrations are located at opposite ends of the soft filament, evidence for interaction between them.
doc	A Situation Calculus-based Approach To Model Ubiquitous Information Services EOS This paper presents an augmented situation calculus-based approach to model autonomous computing paradigm in ubiquitous information services. EOS To make it practical for commercial development and easier to support autonomous paradigm imposed by ubiquitous information services, we made improvements based on Reiter's standard situation calculus. EOS First we explore the inherent relationship between fluents and evolution: since not all fluents contribute to systems' evolution and some fluents can be derived from some others, we define those fluents that are sufficient and necessary to determine evolutional potential as decisive fluents, and then we prove that their successor states wrt to deterministic complex actions satisfy Markov property. EOS Then, within the calculus framework we build, we introduce validity theory to model the autonomous services with application-specific validity requirements, including: validity fluents to axiomatize validity requirements, heuristic multiple alternative service choices ranging from complete acceptance, partial acceptance, to complete rejection, and validity-ensured policy to comprise such alternative service choices into organic, autonomously-computable services.	Our approach is demonstrated by a ubiquitous calendaring service, ACS, throughout the paper.
doc	Ocean Dynamics and the Inner Edge of the Habitable Zone for Tidally Locked Terrestrial Planets EOS Recent studies have shown that ocean dynamics can have a significant warming effect on the permanent night sides of 1 to 1 tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets with Earth-like atmospheres and oceans in the middle of the habitable zone. EOS However, the impact of ocean dynamics on the habitable zone's boundaries (inner edge and outer edge) is still unknown and represents a major gap in our understanding of this type of planets. EOS Here we use a coupled atmosphere-ocean global climate model to show that planetary heat transport from the day to night side is dominated by the ocean at lower stellar fluxes and by the atmosphere near the inner edge of the habitable zone. EOS This decrease in oceanic heat transport (OHT) at high stellar fluxes is mainly due to weakening of surface wind stress and a decrease in surface shortwave energy deposition. EOS We further show that ocean dynamics have almost no effect on the observational thermal phase curves of planets near the inner edge of the habitable zone. EOS For planets in the habitable zone's middle range, ocean dynamics moves the hottest spot on the surface eastward from the substellar point. EOS These results suggest that future studies of the inner edge may devote computational resources to atmosphere-only processes such as clouds and radiation. EOS For studies of the middle range and outer edge of the habitable zone, however, fully coupled ocean-atmosphere modeling will be necessary. EOS Note that due to computational resource limitations, only one rotation period (60 Earth days) has been systematically examined in this study;	future work varying rotation period as well as other parameters such as atmospheric mass and composition is required.
doc	Generalization of the dynamical lack-of-fit reduction EOS The lack-of-fit statistical reduction, developed and formulated first by Bruce Turkington, is a general method taking Liouville equation for probability density (detailed level) and transforming it to reduced dynamics of projected quantities (less detailed level). EOS In this paper the method is generalized. EOS The Hamiltonian Liouville equation is replaced by an arbitrary Hamiltonian evolution combined with gradient dynamics (GENERIC), the Boltzmann entropy is replaced by an arbitrary entropy, and the kinetic energy by an arbitrary energy. EOS The gradient part is a generalized gradient dynamics generated by a dissipation potential. EOS The reduced evolution of the projected state variables is shown to preserve the GENERIC structure of the original (detailed level) evolution.	The dissipation potential is obtained by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

By using this homogeneous spectra sample, we measured the intensities of emission lines and some physical parameters, such as electron temperatures, electron densities, and metallicities.
doc	Dynamical Properties of Quasi-One-Dimensional Boson-Fermion Mixtures of Atoms in a Toroidal Potential EOS We theoretically investigate quantum-mechanical dynamics of quasi-one-dimensional boson-fermion mixtures of atomic gases trapped in a toroidal potential, where effective inter-atomic interactions are tunable and affect the dynamics. EOS We especially focus on effects of quantum statistics and many-body correlations beyond the Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-field approximation on the dynamics.	In order to predict the dynamics, we utilize the numerical exact diagonalization method and also reproduce the calculation in the HF approximation for comparison.

doc	On the buildup of massive early-type galaxies at z<~1. II- The coordinated key role of wet, mixed, and dry major mergers EOS Hierarchical models predict that present-day massive early-type galaxies (mETGs) have finished their assembly at a quite late cosmic epoch (z~0.5), conflicting directly with galaxy mass-downsizing. EOS In Eliche-Moral et al (2010), we presented a semi-analytical model that predicts the increase by a factor of ~2.5 observed in the number density of mETGs since z~1 to the present, just accounting for the effects of the major mergers strictly-reported by observations. EOS Here, we describe the relative, coordinated role of wet, mixed, and dry major mergers in driving this assembly. EOS Accordingly to observations, the model predicts that: 1) wet major mergers have controlled the mETGs buildup since z~1, although dry and mixed mergers have also contributed significantly to it;	2) the bulk of this assembly takes place during the ~1.4 Gyr time-period elapsed at 0.7<z<1, being nearly frozen at z<~0.7;

Based on detector-simulated results, we predict that a lower bound can be placed on the mass of right-handed W-prime_R with standard model-like couplings of m_ W-prime_R > 1800 GeV at sqrt S =7 TeV with 5 fb^-1, and of m_ W-prime_R > 2000 GeV at 8 TeV with 20 fb^-1.

doc	PSR J1119-6127 and its pulsar wind nebula following the magnetar-like bursts EOS We present a Chandra Director's Discretionary Time observation of PSR J1119-6127 and its compact X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) obtained on 27 October 2016, three months after the Fermi and Swift detection of millisecond bursts in hard X-rays, accompanied by >160 times increase in flux. EOS This magnetar-like activity, the first observed from a rotation-powered radio pulsar, provides an important probe of the physical processes that differentiate radio pulsars from magnetars. EOS The post-burst X-ray spectrum of the pulsar can be described by a single powerlaw model with a photon index of 2.0\pm0.2 and an unabsorbed flux of 5.7e-12 ergs/cm^2/s in the 0.5-7.0 keV energy range. EOS At the time of Chandra observations, the pulsar was still brighter by a factor of ~22 in comparison with its quiescence. EOS The X-ray images reveal a nebula brighter than in the pre-burst Chandra observations (from 2002 and 2004), with an unabsorbed flux of 2.2e-13 ergs/cm^-2/s. EOS This implies a current X-ray efficiency of ~0.001 at a distance of 8.4 kpc. EOS In addition, a faint torus-like structure is visible along the southeast-northwest direction and a jet-like feature perpendicular to the torus towards the southwest. EOS The PWN is best fitted by an absorbed powerlaw with a photon index of 2.2\pm0.5 (post-burst).	While the pulsar can still be energetically powered by rotation, the observed changes in PSR~J1119-6127 and its PWN following the magnetar-like bursts point to an additional source of energy powered by its high-magnetic field.

EOS However, the evolution of portable systems and advanced Deep Sub-Micron fabrication technologies have brought power dissipation as another critical design factor. EOS Low power design reduces cooling cost and increases reliability especially for high density systems. EOS Moreover, it reduces the weight and size of portable devices. EOS The power dissipation in CMOS circuits consists of static and dynamic components.	Since dynamic power is proportional to V2 dd and static power is proportional to Vdd, lowering the supply voltage and device dimensions, the transistor threshold voltage also has to be scaled down to achieve the required performance.
doc	Some existence theorems on all fractional _EQN_ -factors with prescribed properties EOS Let _EQN_ be a graph, and _EQN_ with _EQN_ for each _EQN_. EOS We say that _EQN_ admits all fractional _EQN_ -factors if _EQN_ contains a fractional _EQN_ -factor for every _EQN_ with _EQN_ for any _EQN_. EOS Let _EQN_ be a subgraph of _EQN_. EOS We say that _EQN_ has all fractional _EQN_ -factors excluding _EQN_ if for every _EQN_ with _EQN_ for all _EQN_, _EQN_ has a fractional _EQN_ -factor _EQN_ such that _EQN_, where _EQN_ is a function.	In this paper, we show a characterization for the existence of all fractional _EQN_ -factors excluding _EQN_ and obtain two sufficient conditions for a graph to have all fractional _EQN_ -factors excluding _EQN_.

doc	Thin shell implies spectral gap up to polylog via a stochastic localization scheme EOS We consider the isoperimetric inequality on the class of high-dimensional isotropic convex bodies. EOS We establish quantitative connections between two well-known open problems related to this inequality, namely, the thin shell conjecture, and the conjecture by Kannan, Lovasz, and Simonovits, showing that the corresponding optimal bounds are equivalent up to logarithmic factors. EOS In particular we prove that, up to logarithmic factors, the minimal possible ratio between surface area and volume is attained on ellipsoids. EOS We also show that a positive answer to the thin shell conjecture would imply an optimal dependence on the dimension in a certain formulation of the Brunn-Minkowski inequality.	Our results rely on the construction of a stochastic localization scheme for log-concave measures.

doc	Magnetic manipulation of topological states in p-wave superconductors EOS Substantial experimental investigation has provided evidence for spin-triplet pairing in diverse classes of materials and in a variety of artificial heterostructures. EOS A fundamental challenge in actual experiments is how to manipulate the topological behavior of _EQN_ -wave superconductors (PSCs) that could open perspectives for applications. EOS Such a control knob is naturally provided by the spin-triplet character of the PSC order parameter, described by the spin d-vector.	Therefore, in this work we investigate the magnetic field response of one-dimensional (1d) PSCs and demonstrate that the structure of the Cooper pair spin-configuration is crucial to set topological phases with an enhanced number of Majorana fermions per edge, N, ranging from N=0 to 4.
doc	SDSS-IV MANGA: Spatially Resolved Star Formation Main Sequence and LI(N)ER Sequence EOS We present our study on the spatially resolved H_alpha and M_star relation for 536 star-forming and 424 quiescent galaxies taken from the MaNGA survey. EOS We show that the star formation rate surface density (Sigma_SFR), derived based on the H_alpha emissions, is strongly correlated with the M_star surface density (Sigma_star) on kpc scales for star- forming galaxies and can be directly connected to the global star-forming sequence.	This suggests that the global main sequence may be a consequence of a more fundamental relation on small scales.

doc	EATEN: Entity-aware Attention for Single Shot Visual Text Extraction EOS Extracting entity from images is a crucial part of many OCR applications, such as entity recognition of cards, invoices, and receipts. EOS Most of the existing works employ classical detection and recognition paradigm. EOS This paper proposes an Entity-aware Attention Text Extraction Network called EATEN, which is an end-to-end trainable system to extract the entities without any post-processing. EOS In the proposed framework, each entity is parsed by its corresponding entity-aware decoder, respectively. EOS Moreover, we innovatively introduce a state transition mechanism which further improves the robustness of entity extraction.	In consideration of the absence of public benchmarks, we construct a dataset of almost 0.6 million images in three real-world scenarios (train ticket, passport and business card), which is publicly available at https://github.com/beacandler/EATEN.
doc	The Distance of the Dark Matter Deficient Galaxy NGC1052-DF2 EOS We recently inferred that the galaxy NGC1052-DF2 has little or no dark matter and a rich system of unusual globular clusters. EOS We assumed that the galaxy is a satellite of the luminous elliptical galaxy NGC1052 at ~20 Mpc, on the basis of its surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) distance of _EQN_ Mpc, its radial velocity of ~1800 km/s, and its projected position. EOS Here we analyze the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of NGC1052-DF2, following the suggestion by Trujillo et al (2018) that the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) can be detected in currently available HST data and the galaxy is at ~13 Mpc.	Using fully populated galaxy models we show that the CMD is strongly influenced by blends.
doc	The hardwall method of solving the radial Schr\"odinger equation and unmasking hidden symmetries EOS Solving for the bound state eigenvalues of the Schr\"odinger equation is a tedious iterative process when the conventional shooting or matching method is used. EOS In this work, we bypass the eigenvalue's dependence on the eigenfunction by simply trying out all eigenvalues to a desired accuracy. EOS When the eigenvalue is known, the integration for the eigenfunction is then trivial. EOS At a given energy, by outputting the radial distance at which the wave function crosses zero (the hardwall radius), this method automatically determines the entire spectrum of eigenvalues of the radial Schr\"odinger equation without iterative adjustments.	Moreover, such a spherically symmetric "hardwall" can unmask "accidental degeneracy" of eigenvalues due to hidden symmetries.
doc	Embedding small digraphs and permutations in binary trees and split trees EOS We investigate the number of permutations that occur in random labellings of trees. EOS This is a generalisation of the number of subpermutations occurring in a random permutation. EOS It also generalises some recent results on the number of inversions in randomly labelled trees.	We consider complete binary trees as well as random split trees a large class of random trees of logarithmic height introduced by Devroye in 1998.
doc	Multiple dynamic transitions in anisotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet driven by polarised magnetic field EOS Uniaxially (Z-axis) anisotropic Heisenberg ferromagnet, in presence of time dependent (but uniform over space) magnetic field, is studied by Monte Carlo simulation. EOS The time dependent magnetic field was taken as elliptically polarised where the resultant field vector rotates in X-Z plane. EOS The system is cooled (in presence of the elliptically polarised magnetic field) from high temperature. EOS As the temperature decreases, it was found that in the low anisotropy limit the system undergoes three successive dynamical phase transitions.	These three dynamic transitions were confirmed by studying the temperature variation of dynamic 'specific heat'.
doc	Iterative Bayesian Learning for Crowdsourced Regression EOS Crowdsourcing platforms emerged as popular venues for purchasing human intelligence at low cost for large volume of tasks. EOS As many low-paid workers are prone to give noisy answers, a common practice is to add redundancy by assigning multiple workers to each task and then simply average out these answers. EOS However, to fully harness the wisdom of the crowd, one needs to learn the heterogeneous quality of each worker.	We resolve this fundamental challenge in crowdsourced regression tasks, i.e., the answer takes continuous labels, where identifying good or bad workers becomes much more non-trivial compared to a classification setting of discrete labels.
doc	On the Switching between Negative and Positive Thermal Expansion in Framework Structures EOS Thermal expansion is a problem in many technological applications and its control represents a challenge in materials design. EOS In this Letter, after studying the correlation between thermal expansion, cubic-to-rhombohedral transition and lattice parameter of ReO3-type structures, I show how in the different methods for controlling thermal expansion the key element is actually the lattice parameter.	By varying the lattice parameter through external pressure, chemical modifications or other methods, the single-well potential energy of the octahedral rotation, responsible for Negative Thermal Expansion (NTE), can be turned into a quartic anharmonic potential or into a double-well potential, thus enhancing or suppressing the NTE, respectively.
doc	High-dimensional Penalty Selection via Minimum Description Length Principle EOS We tackle the problem of penalty selection of regularization on the basis of the minimum description length (MDL) principle. EOS In particular, we consider that the design space of the penalty function is high-dimensional. EOS In this situation, the luckiness-normalized-maximum-likelihood(LNML)-minimization approach is favorable, because LNML quantifies the goodness of regularized models with any forms of penalty functions in view of the minimum description length principle, and guides us to a good penalty function through the high-dimensional space. EOS However, the minimization of LNML entails two major challenges: 1) the computation of the normalizing factor of LNML and 2) its minimization in high-dimensional spaces. EOS In this paper, we present a novel regularization selection method (MDL-RS), in which a tight upper bound of LNML (uLNML) is minimized with local convergence guarantee.	Our main contribution is the derivation of uLNML, which is a uniform-gap upper bound of LNML in an analytic expression.

doc	Analogs of quantum Hall effect edge states in photonic crystals EOS "Photonic crystals" built with time-reversal-symmetry-breaking Faraday-effect media can exhibit "chiral" edge modes that propagate unidirectionally along boundaries across which the Faraday axis reverses. EOS These modes are precise analogs of the electronic edge states of quantum Hall effect (QHE) systems, and are also immune to backscattering and localization by disorder. EOS The "Berry curvature" of the photonic bands plays a role analogous to that of the magnetic field in the QHE.	Explicit calculations demonstrating the existence of such unidirectionally-propagating photonic edge states are presented.
doc	TOP: Time-to-Event Bayesian Optimal Phase II Trial Design for Cancer Immunotherapy EOS Immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment. EOS Unlike chemotherapies, immune agents often take longer time to show benefit, and the complex and unique mechanism of action of these agents renders the use of multiple endpoints more appropriate in some trials.	These new features of immunotherapy make conventional phase II trial designs, which assume a single binary endpoint that is quickly ascertainable, inefficient and dysfunctional.

EOS Using these results, we define in this paper a new polynomial invariant on hypergraphs.	We give a combinatorial interpretation of this invariant on negative integers which leads to a reciprocity theorem on hypergraphs.
doc	Water Maser Emission from the Active Nucleus in M51 EOS 22 GHz water vapor `kilomaser' emission is reported from the central region of the Whirlpool galaxy M 51 (NGC 5194). EOS The red-shifted spectral features (Vlsr ~ 560 km/s), flaring during most of the year 2000, originate from a spatially unresolved maser spot of size < 30 mas (< 1.5 pc), displaced by < 250 mas from the nucleus. EOS The data provide the first direct evidence for the association of an H2O kilomaser with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). EOS In early 2001, blue-shifted maser emission (Vlsr ~ 435 km/s) was also detected.	Red- and blue-shifted features bracket the systemic velocity asymmetrically.

EOS These observations have better angular resolution than previous work by factors of 2-3 and in addition, allow us to explore the time domain.

doc	ACO for Continuous Function Optimization: A Performance Analysis EOS The performance of the meta-heuristic algorithms often depends on their parameter settings. EOS Appropriate tuning of the underlying parameters can drastically improve the performance of a meta-heuristic. EOS The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a population based meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of the ants, is no different. EOS Fundamentally, the ACO depends on the construction of new solutions, variable by variable basis using Gaussian sampling of the selected variables from an archive of solutions. EOS A comprehensive performance analysis of the underlying parameters such as: selection strategy, distance measure metric and pheromone evaporation rate of the ACO suggests that the Roulette Wheel Selection strategy enhances the performance of the ACO due to its ability to provide non-uniformity and adequate diversity in the selection of a solution.	On the other hand, the Squared Euclidean distance-measure metric offers better performance than other distance-measure metrics.
doc	Entanglement dynamics via semiclassical propagators in systems of two spins EOS We analyze the dynamical generation of entanglement in systems of two interacting spins initially prepared in a product of spin coherent states. EOS For arbitrary time-independent Hamiltonians, we derive a semiclassical expression for the purity of the reduced density matrix as function of time. EOS The final formula, subsidiary to the linear entropy, shows that the short-time dynamics of entanglement depends exclusively on the stability of trajectories governed by the underlying classical Hamiltonian. EOS Also, this semiclassical measure is shown to reproduce the general properties of its quantum counterpart and give the expected result in the large spin limit.	The accuracy of the semiclassical formula is further illustrated in a problem of phase exchange for two particles of spin _EQN_.
doc	Parameterized Complexity of Discrete Morse Theory EOS Optimal Morse matchings reveal essential structures of cell complexes which lead to powerful tools to study discrete geometrical objects, in particular discrete 3-manifolds. EOS However, such matchings are known to be NP-hard to compute on 3-manifolds, through a reduction to the erasability problem. EOS Here, we refine the study of the complexity of problems related to discrete Morse theory in terms of parameterized complexity.	On the one hand we prove that the erasability problem is W[P]-complete on the natural parameter.
doc	A continuum model for alignment of self-propelled particles with anisotropy and density-dependent parameters EOS We consider the macroscopic model derived by Degond and Motsch from a time-continuous version of the Vicsek model, describing the interaction orientation in a large number of self-propelled particles. EOS In this article, we study the influence of a slight modification at the individual level, letting the relaxation parameter depend on the local density and taking in account some anisotropy in the observation kernel (which can model an angle of vision).	The main result is a certain robustness of this macroscopic limit and of the methodology used to derive it.

EOS This set a new record for real-world voting rules and the authors posed the exact determination as a challenge.	Recently, Chen, Cheung, and Ng (2019) showed that the dimension is at most 24.
doc	Relativistic Dissipative Accretion Flow onto Black Hole EOS Dissipations, e.g. EOS heat flow and bulk and shear viscosities, cause the transport of energy, momentum and angular momentum, which is the essence of accretion of matters onto celestial objects. EOS Dissipations are usually described by the Fourier and Navier-Stokes laws ("classic laws" of dissipations).	However the classic laws result in an infinitely fast propagation of dissipations.
doc	Radio Ghosts EOS We investigate the possibility that patches of old radio plasma (`radio ghosts') of former radio galaxies form a second distinct phase of the inter-galactic medium (IGM), not mixed with the thermal gas. EOS The separation of this phase from the ambient gas and its resistance against eroding turbulent forces is given by magnetic fields, which are expected to be roughly in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding medium. EOS Since patches of this plasma are largely invisible in the radio we use the term `radio ghost' to characterize their nature. EOS Possibilities and difficulties of different detection strategies of ghosts are discussed. EOS These involve radio emission, cosmic microwave background (CMB) and starlight Comptonization, and Faraday rotation. EOS Re-activation of the electron population in shock waves of cosmological structure formation, which seems to lead to the cluster radio relic phenomena.	We discuss the role radio ghosts can have: They are able to store relativistic particles for cosmological times, but are also able to release them under the influence of very strong turbulence.
doc	A lattice formulation of the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index EOS Atiyah-Singer index theorem on a lattice without boundary is well understood owing to the seminal work by Hasenfratz et al But its extension to the system with boundary (the so-called Atiyah- Patodi-Singer index theorem), which plays a crucial role in T-anomaly cancellation between bulk- and edge-modes in 3+1 dimensional topological matters, is known only in the continuum theory and no lattice realization has been made so far. EOS In this work, we try to non-perturbatively define an alternative index from the lattice domain-wall fermion in 3+1 dimensions.	We will show that this new index in the continuum limit, converges to the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index defined on a manifold with boundary, which coincides with the surface of the domain-wall.
doc	Evidence of Negative Heat Capacity, Rigidity Percolation and Intermediate Phase in Fast Ion Conducting Conditional Glass Forming System EOS In this work, we observe the rigidity percolation phenomena in a fast ion conducting, conditional glass forming system (AgI)75-x-(Ag2O)25-(MoO3)x. EOS To find out where, why and how the rigidity percolation phenomenon occurs within the range of 20 < x < 37.5, calorimetry and photoelectron spectroscopy experiments are performed. EOS The temperature dependence of heat capacity (normalized) at glass transition temperature (Tg), exhibits fluctuations for samples with higher AgI concentration. EOS This specific quality attributes to fragile glass. EOS The wide range of composition accommodates both the fragile and strong glasses, and therefore a fragility threshold. EOS The heat capacity (absolute) values, at Tg when plotted over the whole range of compositions, exhibits an abrupt sign shift, from negative to positive, revealing the fragility threshold.	The appearance of negative heat capacity has been corroborated with the thermodynamic behavior of nanoclusters.
doc	Non-Abelian parafermions in time-reversal invariant interacting helical systems EOS The interplay between bulk spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interactions produces umklapp scattering in the helical edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator. EOS If the chemical potential is at the Dirac point, umklapp scattering can open a gap in the edge state spectrum even if the system is time-reversal invariant. EOS We determine the zero-energy bound states at the interfaces between a section of a helical liquid which is gapped out by the superconducting proximity effect and a section gapped out by umklapp scattering. EOS We show that these interfaces pin charges which are multiples of _EQN_, giving rise to a Josephson current with _EQN_ periodicity. EOS Moreover, the bound states, which are protected by time-reversal symmetry, are fourfold degenerate and can be described as _EQN_ parafermions.	We determine their braiding statistics and show how braiding can be implemented in topological insulator systems.
doc	Mass estimates in short-period compact binaries EOS Using stellar models we investigate the relation between mass and the spectral type of the secondary star in low-mass short-period compact binaries such as cataclysmic variables and soft X-ray transients. EOS Allowing for different mass transfer rates and different system ages prior to mass transfer we find that the secondaries should populate a band in the spectral type vs. EOS mass plane. EOS The mass M_ms of a ZAMS star with the same spectral type as the donor is effectively an upper limit to the donor mass. EOS The lower mass limit for a given spectral type depends on the mixing length parameter.	If this is large, there is no lower limit if the spectral type is later than K6.
doc	An Optimization-Based Model for Full-body Reaching Movements EOS Background The development of a simulation model of full body reaching tasks that can predict endeffector trajectories and joint excursions consistent with experimental data is a non-trivial task. EOS Because of the kinematic redundancy inherent in these multi-joint tasks there are an infinite number of postures that could be adopted to complete them. EOS By developing models to simulate full-body reaching movements in 3D space we can begin to explore cost functions that may be used by the central nervous system to plan and execute these movements.	Methods A robust simulation model was developed using 1) graphic-based modeling tools to generate an inverse dynamics controller (SimMechanics), 2) controller parameterization methods, and 3) cost function criteria.
doc	The GALEX View of "Boyajian's Star" (KIC 8462852) EOS The enigmatic star KIC 8462852, informally known as "Boyajian's Star", has exhibited unexplained variability from both short timescale (days) dimming events, and years-long fading in the Kepler mission. EOS No single physical mechanism has successfully explained these observations to date. EOS Here we investigate the ultraviolet variability of KIC 8462852 on a range of timescales using data from the GALEX mission that occurred contemporaneously with the Kepler mission. EOS The wide wavelength baseline between the Kepler and GALEX data provides a unique constraint on the nature of the variability. EOS Using 1600 seconds of photon-counting data from four GALEX visits spread over 70 days in 2011, we find no coherent NUV variability in the system on 10-100 second or months timescales. EOS Comparing the integrated flux from these 2011 visits to the 2012 NUV flux published in the GALEX-CAUSE Kepler survey, we find a 3% decrease in brightness for KIC 8462852.	We find this level of variability is significant, but not necessarily unusual for stars of similar spectral type in the GALEX data.
doc	Estimation after selection from bivariate normal population using LINEX loss function EOS Let _EQN_ and _EQN_ be two independent populations, where the population _EQN_ follows a bivariate normal distribution with unknown mean vector _EQN_ and common known variance-covariance matrix _EQN_, _EQN_. EOS The present paper is focused on estimating a characteristic _EQN_ of the selected bivariate normal population, using a LINEX loss function. EOS A natural selection rule is used for achieving the aim of selecting the best bivariate normal population. EOS Some natural-type estimators and Bayes estimator (using a conjugate prior) of _EQN_ are presented. EOS An admissible subclass of equivariant estimators, using the LINEX loss function, is obtained.	Further, a sufficient condition for improving the competing estimators of _EQN_ is derived.
doc	A Numerical Solution of the Time-Dependent Neutron Transport Equation Using the Characteristic Method. Applications to ICF and to Hybrid Fission-Fusion Systems EOS In this work we present a solution of the one-dimensional spherical symmetric time-dependent neutron transport equation (written for a moving system in lagrangian coordinates) by using the characteristic method. EOS One of the objectives is to overcome the negative flux problem that arises when the system is very opaque and the angular neutron flux can become negative when it is extrapolated in spatial meshes --- as, for example, in diamond scheme adopted in many codes. EOS Although there are recipes to overcome this problem, it can completely degrade the numerical solution if repeated many times. EOS The solution presented here can be easily coupled to radiation-hydrodynamics equations, but it is necessary an additional term to maintain neutron conservation in a moving system in lagrangian coordinates. EOS Energy multigroup method and a former SN method to deal with the angular variable are used, with the assumption of isotropic scattering and the transport cross sections approximation. EOS An artifice is employed for emulating the neutron upscattering when neutron energy is lower than the temperature of the medium.	The consistency of the numerical solution is checked by making at each time-step the balance of neutrons in the system.
doc	Portrait Shadow Manipulation EOS Casually-taken portrait photographs often suffer from unflattering lighting and shadowing because of suboptimal conditions in the environment. EOS Aesthetic qualities such as the position and softness of shadows and the lighting ratio between the bright and dark parts of the face are frequently determined by the constraints of the environment rather than by the photographer. EOS Professionals address this issue by adding light shaping tools such as scrims, bounce cards, and flashes. EOS In this paper, we present a computational approach that gives casual photographers some of this control, thereby allowing poorly-lit portraits to be relit post-capture in a realistic and easily-controllable way. EOS Our approach relies on a pair of neural networks---one to remove foreign shadows cast by external objects, and another to soften facial shadows cast by the features of the subject and to add a synthetic fill light to improve the lighting ratio. EOS To train our first network we construct a dataset of real-world portraits wherein synthetic foreign shadows are rendered onto the face, and we show that our network learns to remove those unwanted shadows.	To train our second network we use a dataset of Light Stage scans of human subjects to construct input/output pairs of input images harshly lit by a small light source, and variably softened and fill-lit output images of each face.
doc	A Novel Monocular Disparity Estimation Network with Domain Transformation and Ambiguity Learning EOS Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown state-of-the-art results for low-level computer vision problems such as stereo and monocular disparity estimations, but still, have much room to further improve their performance in terms of accuracy, numbers of parameters, etc. EOS Recent works have uncovered the advantages of using an unsupervised scheme to train CNN's to estimate monocular disparity, where only the relatively-easy-to-obtain stereo images are needed for training. EOS We propose a novel encoder-decoder architecture that outperforms previous unsupervised monocular depth estimation networks by (i) taking into account ambiguities, (ii) efficient fusion between encoder and decoder features with rectangular convolutions and (iii) domain transformations between encoder and decoder. EOS Our architecture outperforms the Monodepth baseline in all metrics, even with a considerable reduction of parameters.	Furthermore, our architecture is capable of estimating a full disparity map in a single forward pass, whereas the baseline needs two passes.
doc	Stellar population synthesis based modelling of the Milky Way using asteroseismology of 13000 Kepler red giants EOS With current space-based missions it is now possible to obtain age-sensitive asteroseismic information for tens of thousands of red giants. EOS This provides a promising opportunity to study the Galactic structure and evolution. EOS We use asteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current theoretical framework of modelling the Galaxy based on population synthesis modeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. EOS We use the open source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of the masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the seismically-inferred observed masses. EOS The Galactic model overestimates the number of low mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low metallicity. EOS Using corrections to the _EQN_ scaling relation suggested by stellar models (available for download) significantly reduces the disagreement between predicted and observed masses. EOS For a few cases where non-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to _EQN_ also improve the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates.	The disagreement between predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is most pronounced for stars with _EQN_ and _EQN_ or for _EQN_ K.
doc	Root systems and diagram calculus. I. Regular extensions of Carter diagrams and the uniqueness of conjugacy classes EOS In 1972, R. EOS Carter introduced admissible diagrams to classify conjugacy classes in a finite Weyl group W. EOS We say that an admissible diagram \Gamma is a Carter diagram if any edge \alpha, \beta with inner product (\alpha, \beta) > 0 (resp. EOS (\alpha, \beta) < 0) is drawn as dotted (resp.	solid) edge.
doc	Chemical segregation of complex organic O-bearing species in Orion KL EOS We investigate the chemical segregation of complex O-bearing species (including the largest and most complex ones detected to date in space) towards Orion KL, the closest high-mass star-forming region. EOS The molecular line images obtained using the ALMA science verification data reveal a clear segregation of chemically related species depending on their different functional groups.	We map the emission of 13CH3OH, HCOOCH3, CH3OCH3, CH2OCH2, CH3COOCH3, HCOOCH2CH3, CH3CH2OCH3, HCOOH, OHCH2CH2OH, CH3COOH, CH3CH2OH, CH3OCH2OH, OHCH2CHO, and CH3COCH3 with 1.5" angular resolution and provide molecular abundances of these species toward different gas components of this region.

doc	Long distance contribution to the _EQN_ mass difference EOS We develop and demonstrate techniques needed to compute the long distance contribution to the _EQN_ - _EQN_ mass difference, _EQN_, in lattice QCD and carry out a first, exploratory calculation of this fundamental quantity. EOS The calculation is performed on 2+1 flavor, domain wall fermion, _EQN_ configurations with a 421 MeV pion mass and an inverse lattice spacing _EQN_ GeV. EOS We include only current-current operators and drop all disconnected and double penguin diagrams. EOS The short distance part of the mass difference in a 2+1 flavor calculation contains a quadratic divergence cut off by the lattice spacing. EOS Here, this quadratic divergence is eliminated through the GIM mechanism by introducing a valence charm quark. EOS The inclusion of the charm quark makes the complete calculation accessible to lattice methods provided the discretization errors associated with the charm quark can be controlled.	The long distance effects are discussed for each parity channel separately.
doc	Watermark Retrieval from 3D Printed Objects via Convolutional Neural Networks EOS We present a method for reading digital data embedded in planar 3D printed surfaces.

At the core of the retrieval method lies a Convolutional Neural Network, outputting a confidence map of the location of the surface textures encoding value 1 bits.
doc	Active Brownian filaments with hydrodynamic interactions: conformations and dynamics EOS The conformational and dynamical properties of active self-propelled filaments/polymers are investigated in the presence of hydrodynamic interactions by both, Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory. EOS Numerically, a discrete linear chain composed of active Brownian particles is considered, analytically, a continuous linear semiflexible polymer with active velocities changing diffusively. EOS The force-free nature of active monomers is accounted for - no Stokeslet fluid flow induced by active forces - and higher order hydrodynamic multipole moments are neglected. EOS The nonequilibrium character of the active process implies a dependence of the stationary-state properties on HI via the polymer relaxation times. EOS In particular, at moderate activities, HI lead to a substantial shrinkage of flexible and semiflexible polymers to an extent far beyond shrinkage of comparable free-draining polymers; EOS even flexible HI-polymers shrink, while active free-draining polymers swell monotonically. EOS Large activities imply a reswelling, however, to a less extent than for non-HI polymers, caused by the shorter polymer relaxation times due to hydrodynamic interactions. EOS The polymer mean square displacement is enhanced, and an activity-determined ballistic regime appears. EOS Over a wide range of time scales, flexible active polymers exhibit a hydrodynamically governed subdiffusive regime, with an exponent significantly smaller than that of the Rouse and Zimm models of passive polymers.	Compared to simulations, the approximate analytical approach predicts a weaker hydrodynamic effect.
doc	The Bursty Star Formation Histories of Low-mass Galaxies at _EQN_ Revealed by Star Formation Rates Measured from H _EQN_ and FUV EOS We investigate the burstiness of star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at _EQN_ by using the ratio of star formation rates (SFRs) measured from H _EQN_ and FUV (1500 \AA) (H _EQN_ --to--FUV ratio). EOS Our sample contains 164 galaxies down to stellar mass (M*) of _EQN_ in the CANDELS GOODS-N region, where Team Keck Redshift Survey DEIMOS spectroscopy and HST/WFC3 F275W images from CANDELS and Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey are available. EOS When the ratio of H _EQN_ - and FUV-derived SFRs is measured, dust extinction correction is negligible (except for very dusty galaxies) with the Calzetti attenuation curve. EOS The H _EQN_ --to--FUV ratio of our sample increases with M* and SFR.	The median ratio is _EQN_ 0.7 at M* _EQN_ (or SFR _EQN_) and increases to _EQN_ 1 at M* _EQN_ (or SFR _EQN_).
doc	Covariant gaussian approximation in Ginzburg - Landau model EOS Condensed matter systems undergoing second order transition away from the critical fluctuation region are usually described sufficiently well by the mean field approximation. EOS The critical fluctuation region, determined by the Ginzburg criterion, _EQN_, is narrow even in high _EQN_ superconductors and has universal features well captured by the renormalization group method. EOS However recent experiments on magnetization, conductivity and Nernst effect suggest that fluctuations effects are large in a wider region both above and below _EQN_.	In particular some "pseudogap" phenomena and strong renormalization of the mean field critical temperature _EQN_ can be interpreted as strong fluctuations effects that are nonperturbative (cannot be accounted for by "gaussian fluctuations").
doc	Polymorphic Type Inference for Machine Code EOS For many compiled languages, source-level types are erased very early in the compilation process. EOS As a result, further compiler passes may convert type-safe source into type-unsafe machine code. EOS Type-unsafe idioms in the original source and type-unsafe optimizations mean that type information in a stripped binary is essentially nonexistent. EOS The problem of recovering high-level types by performing type inference over stripped machine code is called type reconstruction, and offers a useful capability in support of reverse engineering and decompilation. EOS In this paper, we motivate and develop a novel type system and algorithm for machine-code type inference. EOS The features of this type system were developed by surveying a wide collection of common source- and machine-code idioms, building a catalog of challenging cases for type reconstruction. EOS We found that these idioms place a sophisticated set of requirements on the type system, inducing features such as recursively-constrained polymorphic types. EOS Many of the features we identify are often seen only in expressive and powerful type systems used by high-level functional languages. EOS Using these type-system features as a guideline, we have developed Retypd: a novel static type-inference algorithm for machine code that supports recursive types, polymorphism, and subtyping.	Retypd yields more accurate inferred types than existing algorithms, while also enabling new capabilities such as reconstruction of pointer const annotations with 98% recall.
doc	Noncommuting conserved quantities in quantum many-body thermalization EOS In statistical mechanics, a small system exchanges conserved quantities---heat, particles, electric charge, etc.---with a bath. EOS The small system thermalizes to the canonical ensemble, or the grand canonical ensemble, etc., depending on the conserved quantities. EOS The conserved quantities are represented by operators usually assumed to commute with each other. EOS This assumption was removed within quantum-information-theoretic (QI-theoretic) thermodynamics recently. EOS The small system's long-time state was dubbed ``the non-Abelian thermal state (NATS).'' We propose an experimental protocol for observing a system thermalize to the NATS.	We illustrate with a chain of spins, a subset of which form the system of interest.
doc	Analytic solution of the Domain Wall non-equilibrium stationary state EOS We consider the out-of-equilibrium dynamics generated by joining two domains with arbitrary opposite magnetisations. EOS We study the stationary state which emerges by the unitary evolution via the spin _EQN_ XXZ Hamiltonian, in the gapless regime, where the system develops a stationary spin current. EOS Using the generalized hydrodynamic approach, we present a simple formula for the space-time profile of the spin current and the magnetisation exact in the limit of large times. EOS As a remarkable effect, we show that the stationary state has a strongly discontinuous dependence on the strength of interaction.	This feature allows us to give a qualitative estimation for the transient behavior of the current which is compared with numerical simulations.
doc	String topology for spheres EOS Let _EQN_ be a compact oriented _EQN_ -dimensional smooth manifold. EOS Chas and Sullivan have defined a structure of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra on _EQN_. EOS Extending work of Cohen, Jones and Yan, we compute this Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra structure when _EQN_ is a sphere _EQN_, _EQN_. EOS In particular, we show that _EQN_ and the Hochschild cohomology _EQN_ are surprisingly not isomorphic as Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras, although we prove that, as expected, the underlying Gerstenhaber algebras are isomorphic.	The proof requires the knowledge of the Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra _EQN_ that we compute in the Appendix.
doc	Relaxation dynamics of ultracold bosons in a double-well potential: Thermalization and prethermalization in a nearly integrable model EOS We numerically investigate the relaxation dynamics in an isolated quantum system of interacting bosons trapped in a double-well potential after an integrability breaking quench. EOS Using the statistics of the spectrum, we identify the postquench Hamiltonian as nonchaotic and close to integrability over a wide range of interaction parameters. EOS We demonstrate that the system exhibits thermalization in the context of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). EOS We also explore the possibility of an initial state to delocalize with respect to the eigenstates of the postquench Hamiltonian even for energies away from the middle of the spectrum.	We observe distinct regimes of equilibration process depending on the initial energy.

EOS In this article, we provide an overview of the organization of the Astropy project and summarize key features in the core package as of the recent major release, version 2.0. EOS We then describe the project infrastructure designed to facilitate and support development for a broader ecosystem of inter-operable packages.	We conclude with a future outlook of planned new features and directions for the broader Astropy project.

doc	Playing with Duality: An Overview of Recent Primal-Dual Approaches for Solving Large-Scale Optimization Problems EOS Optimization methods are at the core of many problems in signal/image processing, computer vision, and machine learning. EOS For a long time, it has been recognized that looking at the dual of an optimization problem may drastically simplify its solution. EOS Deriving efficient strategies which jointly brings into play the primal and the dual problems is however a more recent idea which has generated many important new contributions in the last years. EOS These novel developments are grounded on recent advances in convex analysis, discrete optimization, parallel processing, and non-smooth optimization with emphasis on sparsity issues.	In this paper, we aim at presenting the principles of primal-dual approaches, while giving an overview of numerical methods which have been proposed in different contexts.

doc	The Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey: Precursor Observations of the NGC 628 group EOS The Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES) is one of several HI surveys utilising the new Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) fitted to the 305m radio telescope at Arecibo. EOS The survey is specifically designed to investigate various galactic environments to higher sensitivity, higher velocity resolution and higher spatial resolution than previous fully sampled, 21 cm multibeam surveys. EOS The emphasis is on making detailed observations of nearby objects although the large system bandwidth (100 MHz) will allow us to quantify the HI properties over a large instantaneous velocity range.	In this paper we describe the survey and its goals and present the results from the precursor observations of a 5 degree x 1 degree region containing the nearby (~10 Mpc) NGC 628 group.

doc	Observation of the extremely bright flare of the FSRQ 3C279 with H.E.S.S. II EOS In June 2015, the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar 3C 279 underwent an extremely bright gamma-ray flare, with an increase of the flux above 100 MeV by a factor 10 in less than 1 day, revealing an intrinsic variability timescale of 2 minutes as detected by the Fermi-LAT. EOS We present results of target of opportunity observations with the H.E.S.S. EOS experiment on this source over the nights around the peak of the outburst. EOS The H.E.S.S. EOS data were analysed with mono and stereo chains. EOS Thanks to the extreme brightness of the source at GeV energies, it was possible to obtain data from Fermi-LAT, strictly simultaneous to the H.E.S.S. EOS observation. EOS Simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous observations at optical and X-ray energies were gathered to reconstruct the multi-wavelength spectrum helping to constrain theoretical models describing the flare. EOS The H.E.S.S. EOS observation during the second night, using H.E.S.S. EOS II MONO data, lead to a clear detection of the source in about 3 hours of live-time. EOS The H.E.S.S. EOS results were also used to derive limits on the Quantum Gravity scale under the assumption of Lorentz Invariance Violation. EOS Furthermore, since FSRQs possess intense optical photon fields surrounding the central region near the black hole, the VHE data allows constraints on the location of the emitting region to be derived in order that internal absorption be avoided.

doc	Ca II K Spectral Study of an Emerging Flux Region using Domeless Solar Telescope in Hida Observatory EOS A cooperative observation with Hida observatory and Hinode satellite was performed on an emerging flux region. EOS The successive Ca II K spectro-heliograms of the emerging flux region were taken by the Domeless Solar Telescope of Hida observatory. EOS Hinode observed the emerging flux region with Ca II H and Fe I Stokes IQUV filtergrams. EOS In this study, detailed dynamics and temporal evolution of the magnetic flux emergence was studied observationally. EOS The event was first detected in the photospheric magnetic field signals. EOS 3 minutes later, the horizontal expansion of the dark area was detected. EOS And then, 7 minutes later than the horizontal expansion, the emerging loops were detected with the maximal rise speed of 2.1 km/s at chromospheric heights.	The observed dynamics of emerging magnetic flux from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere is well consistent with the results of previous simulation works.

doc	Twisted cyclic theory and an index theory for the gauge invariant KMS state on Cuntz algebras EOS This paper presents, by example, an index theory appropriate to algebras without trace. EOS Whilst we work exclusively with the Cuntz algebras the exposition is designed to indicate how to develop a general theory. EOS Our main result is an index theorem (formulated in terms of spectral flow) using a twisted cyclic cocycle where the twisting comes from the modular automorphism group for the canonical gauge action on the Cuntz algebra. EOS We introduce a modified _EQN_ -group of the Cuntz algebra so as to pair with this twisted cocycle.	As a corollary we obtain a noncommutative geometry interpretation for Araki's notion of relative entropy in this example.
doc	Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology and Circles in the Cosmic Microwave Background EOS We examine the possibility that circles in the cosmic microwave background could be formed by the interaction of a gravitational wave pulse emitted in some pre-big-bang phase of the universe with the last scattering surface. EOS We derive the expected size distribution of such circles, as well as their typical ring width and (for concentric circles) angular separation.	We apply these results in particular to conformal cyclic cosmology, ekpyrotic cosmology as well as loop quantum cosmology with and without inflation in order to determine how the predicted geometric properties of these circles would vary from one model to the other, and thus, if detected, could allow us to differentiate between various pre-big-bang cosmological models.
doc	A search for enhanced very high energy gamma-ray emission from the March 2013 Crab Nebula flare EOS In March 2013, a flaring episode from the Crab Nebula lasting ~2 weeks was detected by the Fermi-LAT (Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope). EOS VERITAS provides simultaneous observations throughout this period. EOS During the flare, the Fermi-LAT detected a 20-fold increase in flux above the average synchrotron flux >100 MeV seen from the Crab Nebula. EOS Simultaneous measurements with VERITAS are consistent with the non-variable long-term average Crab Nebula flux at TeV energies.	Assuming a linear correlation between the very-high-energy flux change >1 TeV and the flux change seen in the Fermi-LAT band >100 MeV during the period of simultaneous observations, the linear correlation factor can be constrained to be at most 8.6 * 10^-3 with 95% confidence.
doc	Towards a Microscopic Reaction Description Based on Energy-Density-Functional Structure Models EOS A microscopic calculation of reaction cross sections for nucleon-nucleus scattering has been performed by explicitly coupling the elastic channel to all particle-hole excitations in the target and one-nucleon pickup channels. EOS The particle-hole states may be regarded as doorway states through which the flux flows to more complicated configurations, and subsequently to long-lived compound nucleus resonances. EOS Target excitations for _EQN_ Ca, _EQN_ Ni, _EQN_ Zr and _EQN_ Sm were described in a random-phase framework using a Skyrme functional. EOS Reaction cross sections obtained agree very well with experimental data and predictions of a state-of-the-art fitted optical potential.	Couplings between inelastic states were found to be negligible, while the pickup channels contribute significantly.
doc	Enhanced light emission from top-emitting organic light-emitting diodes by optimizing surface plasmon polariton losses EOS We demonstrate enhanced light extraction for monochrome top-emitting organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). EOS The enhancement by a factor of 1.2 compared to a reference sample is caused by the use of a hole transport layer (HTL) material possessing a low refractive index (1.52). EOS The low refractive index reduces the in-plane wave vector of the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) excited at the interface between the bottom opaque metallic electrode (anode) and the HTL. EOS The shift of the SPP dispersion relation decreases the power dissipated into lost evanescent excitations and thus increases the outcoupling efficiency, although the SPP remains constant in intensity. EOS The proposed method is suitable for emitter materials owning isotropic orientation of the transition dipole moments as well as anisotropic, preferentially horizontal orientation, resulting in comparable enhancement factors. EOS Furthermore, for sufficiently low refractive indices of the HTL material, the SPP can be modeled as a propagating plane wave within other organic materials in the optical microcavity.	Thus, by applying further extraction methods, such as micro lenses or Bragg gratings, it would become feasible to obtain even higher enhancements of the light extraction.

doc	Transactive Energy System: Market-Based Coordination of Distributed Energy Resources EOS Distributed energy resources (DER) provide significant value for renewable energy integration in modern power grids. EOS However, unlocking this value requires complex design and coordination. EOS This paper focuses on the emerging transactive energy systems, which draw tools and principles from economics to design the coordination strategies for DERs. EOS The concept of transactive energy system broadly captures a huge body of literature, and many of them are closely related but fundamentally different. EOS This gives rise to the following questions: how to formally compare different transactive energy systems and their proposed approaches? EOS How to choose the right transactive energy system to formulate a given problem? EOS What tools are available in the literature for each class of transactive energy systems? EOS In this paper, we answer these questions by synthesizing a unifying framework for a large class of problems studied in the literature. EOS The framework consists of preferences, control decision, information structure and solution concept. EOS These elements are important in identifying and distinguishing various transactive energy systems in the literature.	We employ the proposed framework to analyze a few important class of transactive energy systems.

EOS Generically, for a polynomial _EQN_ of degree _EQN_, there are exactly _EQN_ distinct degree _EQN_ polynomials with the same set of cyclic resultants as _EQN_. EOS However, in the generic monic case, degree _EQN_ polynomials are uniquely determined by their cyclic resultants.	Moreover, two reciprocal (``palindromic'') polynomials giving rise to the same set of nonzero cyclic resultants are equal.

EOS The multiple states are found to be very robust and are expected to persist beyond _EQN_. EOS The rotation ratio is the parameter that most strongly controls the transitions between the flow states;	the transitional values only weakly depend on the Taylor number.
doc	B-mode Detection with an Extended Planck Mission EOS The Planck satellite has a nominal mission lifetime of 14 months allowing two complete surveys of the sky. EOS Here we investigate the potential of an extended Planck mission of four sky surveys to constrain primordial B-mode anisotropies in the presence of dominant Galactic polarized foreground emission. EOS An extended Planck mission is capable of powerful constraints on primordial B-modes at low multipoles, which cannot be probed by ground based or sub-orbital experiments. EOS A tensor-scalar ratio of r=0.05 can be detected at a high significance level by an extended Planck mission and it should be possible to set a 95% upper limit on r of 0.03 if the tensor-scalar ratio is vanishingly small.	Furthermore, extending the Planck mission to four sky surveys offers better control of polarized Galactic dust emission, since the 217 GHz frequency band can be used as an effective dust template in addition to the 353 GHz channel.

doc	Exclusion process for particles of arbitrary extension: Hydrodynamic limit and algebraic properties EOS The behaviour of extended particles with exclusion interaction on a one-dimensional lattice is investigated. EOS The basic model is called _EQN_ -ASEP as a generalization of the asymmetric exclusion process (ASEP) to particles of arbitrary length _EQN_. EOS Stationary and dynamical properties of the _EQN_ -ASEP with periodic boundary conditions are derived in the hydrodynamic limit from microscopic properties of the underlying stochastic many-body system. EOS In particular, the hydrodynamic equation for the local density evolution and the time-dependent diffusion constant of a tracer particle are calculated.	As a fundamental algebraic property of the symmetric exclusion process (SEP) the SU(2)-symmetry is generalized to the case of extended particles.

EOS Special attention is paid to the difference of the asymmetry parameter between the boiling sheet and that of the condensation sheet of the surface of equilibrium. EOS We derive the condition of existence of the regime of retrograde condensation at the boiling of the asymmetric nuclear matter. EOS We have performed calculations of the caloric curves in the case of isobaric heating.	We have shown the presence of the plateau region in caloric curves at the isobaric heating of the asymmetric nuclear matter.
doc	Star clusters in the solar neighborhood: a solution to Oort's problem EOS In 1958 Jan Oort remarked that the lack of old clusters in the solar neighborhood (SN) implies that clusters are destroyed on a timescale of less than a Gyr. EOS This is much shorter than the predicted dissolution time of clusters due to stellar evolution and two-body relaxation in the tidal field of the Galaxy. EOS So, other (external) effects must play a dominant role in the destruction of star clusters in the solar neighborhood. EOS We recalculated the survival time of initially bound star clusters in the solar neighborhood taking into account: (1) stellar evolution, (2) tidal stripping, (3) perturbations by spiral arms and (4) encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs). EOS We find that encounters with GMCs are the most damaging to clusters. EOS The resulting predicted dissolution time of these combined effects, t_dis=1.7 (Mi/10^4 M_sun)^0.67 Gyr for clusters in the mass range of 10^2 < M < 10^5 M_sun, is very similar to the disruption time of t_dis=1.3+/-0.5 (M/10^4 M_sun)^0.62 Gyr that was derived empirically from a mass limited sample of clusters in the solar neighborhood within 600 pc. EOS The predicted shape of the age distribution of clusters agrees very well with the observed one.	The comparison between observations and theory implies a surface star formation rate (SFR) near the sun of 3.5x10^-10 M_sun yr^-1 pc^-2 for stars in bound clusters with an initial mass in the range of 10^2 to 3x10^4 M_sun.
doc	Electrical control of exchange spring in antiferromagnetic metals EOS Manipulation of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spins by electrical means is on great demand to develop the AFM spintronics with low power consumption. EOS In spite of the electrical modulation of insulated AFMs through coupling between their intrinsic ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism, direct electrical control of AFM metals remains challenging due to the screening effect by the surface charge, and the manipulation is confined to a limited depth of atomic dimensions, which is insufficient to form a stable AFM exchange spring. EOS In the present letter we primarily report a reversible electrical control of exchange spring in AFM metals, using an ionic liquid to exert a substantial electric-field effect.	The exchange spring could transfer the force to the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface, enabling a deeper modulation depth in AFM metals.

doc	COVID-19 Remote Patient Monitoring: Social Impact of AI EOS A primary indicator of success in the fight against COVID-19 is avoiding stress on critical care infrastructure and services (CCIS). EOS However, CCIS will likely remain stressed until sustained herd immunity is built.

EOS We envision technology plays a pivotal role.	Here, we focus on the effective use of readily available technology to improve the primary and secondary success criteria for the fight against SARS-CoV-2.
doc	Resolution of the wavefront set using general continuous wavelet transforms EOS We consider the problem of characterizing the wavefront set of a tempered distribution _EQN_ in terms of its continuous wavelet transform, where the latter is defined with respect to a suitably chosen dilation group _EQN_. EOS In this paper we develop a comprehensive and unified approach that allows to establish characterizations of the wavefront set in terms of rapid coefficient decay, for a large variety of dilation groups. EOS For this purpose, we introduce two technical conditions on the dual action of the group _EQN_, called microlocal admissibilty and (weak) cone approximation property. EOS Essentially, microlocal admissibilty sets up a systematical relationship between the scales in a wavelet dilated by _EQN_ on one side, and the matrix norm of _EQN_ on the other side. EOS The (weak) cone approximation property describes the ability of the wavelet system to adapt its frequency-side localization to arbitrary frequency cones. EOS Together, microlocal admissibility and the weak cone approximation property allow the characterization of points in the wavefront set using multiple wavelets.	Replacing the weak cone approximation by its stronger counterpart gives access to single wavelet characterizations.
doc	Conditional teleportation using optical squeezers and photon counting EOS We suggest a scheme of using two-mode squeezed vacuum for conditional teleportation of quantum states of optical field. EOS Alice mixes the input state with one of the squeezed modes on another squeezing device and detects the output photon numbers.	The result is then communicated to Bob who shifts the photon number of his part accordingly.
doc	A pattern theorem for lattice clusters EOS We consider general classes of lattice clusters, including various kinds of animals and trees on different lattices. EOS We prove that if a given local configuration ("pattern") of sites and bonds can occur in large clusters, then it occurs at least cN times in most clusters of size n, for some constant c>0. EOS An analogous theorem for self-avoiding walks was proven in 1963 by Kesten.	The results also apply to weighted sums, and in particular we can take a _EQN_ to be the probability that the percolation cluster containing the origin consists of exactly n sites.

doc	A Unifying Framework for Manipulation Problems EOS Manipulation models for electoral systems are a core research theme in social choice theory; EOS they include bribery (unweighted, weighted, swap, shift,...), control (by adding or deleting voters or candidates), lobbying in referenda and others. EOS We develop a unifying framework for manipulation models with few types of people, one of the most commonly studied scenarios. EOS A critical insight of our framework is to separate the descriptive complexity of the voting rule R from the number of types of people. EOS This allows us to finally settle the computational complexity of R-Swap Bribery, one of the most fundamental manipulation problems. EOS In particular, we prove that R-Swap Bribery is fixed-parameter tractable when R is Dodgson's rule and Young's rule, when parameterized by the number of candidates. EOS This way, we resolve a long-standing open question from 2007 which was explicitly asked by Faliszewski et al [JAIR 40, 2011]. EOS Our algorithms reveal that the true hardness of bribery problems often stems from the complexity of the voting rules. EOS On one hand, we give a fixed-parameter algorithm parameterized by number of types of people for complex voting rules.	Thus, we reveal that R-Swap Bribery with Dodgson's rule is much harder than with Condorcet's rule, which can be expressed by a conjunction of linear inequalities, while Dodson's rule requires quantifier alternation and a bounded number of disjunctions of linear systems.
doc	Tensor Methods and Recommender Systems EOS A substantial progress in development of new and efficient tensor factorization techniques has led to an extensive research of their applicability in recommender systems field. EOS Tensor-based recommender models push the boundaries of traditional collaborative filtering techniques by taking into account a multifaceted nature of real environments, which allows to produce more accurate, situational (e.g. EOS context-aware, criteria-driven) recommendations. EOS Despite the promising results, tensor-based methods are poorly covered in existing recommender systems surveys.	This survey aims to complement previous works and provide a comprehensive overview on the subject.
doc	New observations of DW Cnc: where is the 38 min signal? EOS We present extensive radial-velocity observations of the intermediate polar DW Cnc during its 2018-2019 low state. EOS We show that the 86 min signal, associated with the orbital period is strong in our radial velocity analysis, power spectrum search, as well as in our Doppler Tomography.	However, we find that the velocity modulation associated with the 70-min beat period and the 38-min spin cycle are dramatically weaker than previously observed.

EOS For this reason, ensuring safety in social media platforms is a necessity. EOS Use of dangerous language such as physical threats in online environments is a somewhat rare, yet remains highly important. EOS Although several works have been performed on the related issue of detecting offensive and hateful language, dangerous speech has not previously been treated in any significant way.	Motivated by these observations, we report our efforts to build a labeled dataset for dangerous speech.

EOS The main purpose of this work is to create a complete and reasoned database of CMB absolute temperatures.	The simple database format permits a reading of the data through any text editor or through programs for data handling.

We introduce and compare a class of spectra with the property that the underlying random process is least predictable at any given point from the complete set of past and future observations.

doc	Liquid Density Sensing Using Resonant Flexural Plate Wave Device with Sol-Gel PZT Thin Films EOS This paper presents the design, fabrication and preliminary experimental results of a flexure plate wave (FPW) resonator using sol-gel derived lead zirconate titanates (PZT) thin films. EOS The resonator adopts a two-port structure with reflecting grates on the composite membrane of PZT and SiNx. EOS The design of the reflecting grate is derived from a SAW resonator model using COM theory to produce a sharp resonant peak. EOS The comparison between the mass and the viscosity effects from the theoretical expression illustrates the applications and the constraints of the proposed device in liquid sensing. EOS Multiple coatings of sol-gel derived PZT films are adopted because of the cost advantage and the high electromechanical coupling effect over other piezoelectric films. EOS The fabrication issues of the proposed material structure are addressed.	Theoretical estimations of the mass and the viscosity effects are compared with the experimental results.
doc	The symmetrization problem for multiple orthogonal polynomials EOS We analyze the effect of symmetrization in the theory of multiple orthogonal polynomials. EOS For a symmetric sequence of type II multiple orthogonal polynomials satisfying a high-term recurrence relation, we fully characterize the Weyl function associated to the corresponding block Jacobi matrix as well as the Stieltjes matrix function. EOS Next, from an arbitrary sequence of type II multiple orthogonal polynomials with respect to a set of d linear functionals, we obtain a total of d+1 sequences of type II multiple orthogonal polynomials, which can be used to construct a new sequence of symmetric type II multiple orthogonal polynomials.	Finally, we prove a Favard-type result for certain sequences of matrix multiple orthogonal polynomials satisfying a matrix four-term recurrence relation with matrix coefficients.
doc	Performance Evaluation of Caching Policies in NDN - an ICN Architecture EOS Information Centric Networking (ICN) advocates the philosophy of accessing the content independent of its location. EOS Owing to this location independence in ICN, the routers en-route can be enabled to cache the content to serve the future requests for the same content locally.	Several ICN architectures have been proposed in the literature along with various caching algorithms for caching and cache replacement at the routers en-route.
doc	Biased Average Position Estimates in Line and Bar Graphs: Underestimation, Overestimation, and Perceptual Pull EOS In visual depictions of data, position (i.e., the vertical height of a line or a bar) is believed to be the most precise way to encode information compared to other encodings (e.g., hue). EOS Not only are other encodings less precise than position, but they can also be prone to systematic biases (e.g., color category boundaries can distort perceived differences between hues). EOS By comparison, position's high level of precision may seem to protect it from such biases. EOS In contrast, across three empirical studies, we show that while position may be a precise form of data encoding, it can also produce systematic biases in how values are visually encoded, at least for reports of average position across a short delay. EOS In displays with a single line or a single set of bars, reports of average positions were significantly biased, such that line positions were underestimated and bar positions were overestimated.	In displays with multiple data series (i.e., multiple lines and/or sets of bars), this systematic bias still persisted.

doc	Integrating factors for groups of formal complex diffeomorphisms EOS We study groups of formal or germs of analytic diffeomorphisms in several complex variables. EOS Such groups are related to the study of the transverse structure and dynamics of Holomorphic foliations, via the notion of holonomy group of a leaf of a foliation. EOS For dimension one, there is a well-established dictionary relating analytic/formal classification of the group, with its algebraic properties (finiteness, commutativity, solvability,...). EOS Such system of equivalences also characterizes the existence of suitable integrating factors, i.e., invariant vector fields and one-forms associated to the group. EOS In this paper we search the basic lines of such dictionary for the case of several complex variables groups. EOS For abelian, metabelian, solvable or nilpotent groups we investigate the existence of suitable formal vector fields and closed differential forms which exhibit an invariance property under the group action.	Our results are applicable in the construction of suitable integrating factors for holomorphic foliations with singularities.
doc	Complexity Factor for Static Sphere in Self-interacting Brans-Dicke Gravity EOS In this paper, we study the complexity factor of a static anisotropic sphere in the context of self-interacting Brans-Dicke theory. EOS We split the Riemann tensor using Bel's approach to obtain structure scalars relating to comoving congruence and Tolman mass in the presence of a scalar field. EOS We then define the complexity factor with the help of these scalars to demonstrate the complex nature of the system. EOS We also evaluate the vanishing complexity condition to obtain solutions for two stellar models.	It is concluded that the complexity of the system increases with the inclusion of the scalar field and potential function.

doc	Observation of the two way shape memory effect in an atomistic model of martensitic transformation EOS We study a system of classical particles in two dimensions interacting through an isotropic pair potential that displays a martensitic phase transition between a triangular and a rhomboidal structure upon the change of a single parameter. EOS Previously it was shown that this potential is able to reproduce the shape memory effect and super-elasticity, among other well known features of the phenomenology of martensites. EOS Here we extend those previous studies and describe the development of the more subtle two-way shape memory effect.	We show that in a poly-crystalline sample, the effect can be associated to the existence of retained martensite within the austenite phase.

EOS The principle is compatible with the boundary-value problem of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations, and leads to ``natural boundary conditions'' on the shell. EOS These conditions and the gravitational field equations which follow from an initial variational principle, are used for elimination of the gravitational degrees of freedom. EOS The transformation of the variational formula for spherically-symmetric systems leads to two natural variants of the effective action.	One of these variants describes the shell from a stationary interior observer's point of view, another from the exterior one.
doc	Structure and regularity for subsets of groups with finite VC-dimension EOS Suppose _EQN_ is a finite group and _EQN_ is such that _EQN_ has VC-dimension strictly less than _EQN_. EOS We find algebraically well-structured sets in _EQN_ which, up to a chosen _EQN_, describe the structure of _EQN_ and behave regularly with respect to translates of _EQN_. EOS For the subclass of groups with uniformly fixed finite exponent _EQN_, these algebraic objects are normal subgroups with index bounded in terms of _EQN_, _EQN_, and _EQN_.	For arbitrary groups, we use Bohr neighborhoods of bounded rank and width inside normal subgroups of bounded index.
doc	On a recent preliminary study for the measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect with the Galileo satellites EOS It has been recently proposed to combine the node drifts of the future constellation of 27 Galileo spacecraft together with those of the existing LAGEOS-type satellites to improve the accuracy of the past and ongoing tests of the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect by removing the bias of a larger number of even zonal harmonics _EQN_ than either done or planned so far. EOS Actually, it seems a difficult goal to be realistically achieved for a number of reasons.	First, the LT range signature of a Galileo-type satellite is as little as _EQN_ mm over 3-days arcs, corresponding to a node rate of just _EQN_ milliarcseconds per year (mas yr _EQN_).

doc	Stochastic maximum principle for optimal control of SPDEs EOS We prove a version of the maximum principle, in the sense of Pontryagin, for the optimal control of a stochastic partial differential equation driven by a finite dimensional Wiener process. EOS The equation is formulated in a semi-abstract form that allows direct applications to a large class of controlled stochastic parabolic equations. EOS We allow for a diffusion coefficient dependent on the control parameter, and the space of control actions is general, so that in particular we need to introduce two adjoint processes.	The second adjoint process takes values in a suitable space of operators on _EQN_.
doc	Impact of the ionization of the atomic shell on the lifetime of the _EQN_ Th isomer EOS Contemporary data are analyzed concerning the half-lives of the _EQN_ Th isomer in neutral atoms and various ions.

EOS Calculation is performed on the united platform of interplay of traditional and subthreshold resonance conversion.	General agreement with experiment is obtained in the cases of Th _EQN_ and Th _EQN_, a prediction is made concerning Th _EQN_.
doc	A note on the Holst action, the time gauge, and the Barbero-Immirzi parameter EOS In this note, we review the canonical analysis of the Holst action in the time gauge, with a special emphasis on the Hamiltonian equations of motion and the fixation of the Lagrange multipliers. EOS This enables us to identify at the Hamiltonian level the various components of the covariant torsion tensor, which have to be vanishing in order for the classical theory not to depend upon the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.	We also introduce a formulation of three-dimensional gravity with an explicit phase space dependency on the Barbero-Immirzi parameter as a potential way to investigate its fate and relevance in the quantum theory.

doc	Characterization of the HAYSTAC axion dark matter search cavity using microwave measurement and simulation techniques EOS Many searches for axion cold dark matter rely on the use of tunable electromagnetic resonators. EOS Current detectors operate at or near microwave frequencies and use cylindrical cavities with cylindrical tuning rods. EOS The cavity performance strongly impacts the signal power of the detector, which is expected to be very small even under optimal conditions. EOS There is strong motivation to characterize these microwave cavities and improve their performance in order to maximize the achievable signal power. EOS We present the results of a study characterizing the HAYSTAC (Haloscope At Yale Sensitive to Axion Cold dark matter) cavity using bead perturbation measurements and detailed 3D electromagnetic simulations. EOS This is the first use of bead perturbation methods to characterize an axion haloscope cavity. EOS In this study, we measured impacts of misalignments on the order of 0.001 in and demonstrated that the same impacts can be predicted using electromagnetic simulations. EOS We also performed a detailed study of mode crossings and hybridization between the TM _EQN_ mode used in operation and other cavity modes. EOS This mixing limits the tuning range of the cavity that can be used during an axion search. EOS By characterizing each mode crossing in detail, we show that some mode crossings are benign and are potentially still useful for data collection. EOS The level of observed agreement between measurements and simulations demonstrates that finite element modeling can capture non-ideal cavity behavior and the impacts of very small imperfections.	3D electromagnetic simulations and bead perturbation measurements are standard tools in the microwave engineering community, but they have been underutilized in axion cavity design.
doc	Building Instance Classification Using Street View Images EOS Land-use classification based on spaceborne or aerial remote sensing images has been extensively studied over the past decades. EOS Such classification is usually a patch-wise or pixel-wise labeling over the whole image. EOS But for many applications, such as urban population density mapping or urban utility planning, a classification map based on individual buildings is much more informative. EOS However, such semantic classification still poses some fundamental challenges, for example, how to retrieve fine boundaries of individual buildings. EOS In this paper, we proposed a general framework for classifying the functionality of individual buildings. EOS The proposed method is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which classify facade structures from street view images, such as Google StreetView, in addition to remote sensing images which usually only show roof structures. EOS Geographic information was utilized to mask out individual buildings, and to associate the corresponding street view images.	We created a benchmark dataset which was used for training and evaluating CNNs.
doc	A Deep Neural Network Sentence Level Classification Method with Context Information EOS In the sentence classification task, context formed from sentences adjacent to the sentence being classified can provide important information for classification. EOS This context is, however, often ignored. EOS Where methods do make use of context, only small amounts are considered, making it difficult to scale. EOS We present a new method for sentence classification, Context-LSTM-CNN, that makes use of potentially large contexts.	The method also utilizes long-range dependencies within the sentence being classified, using an LSTM, and short-span features, using a stacked CNN.
doc	From solid solution to cluster formation of Fe and Cr in _EQN_ -Zr EOS To understand the mechanisms by which Fe and Cr additions increase the corrosion rate of irradiated Zr alloys, a combination of experimental (atom probe tomography, x-ray diffraction and thermoelectric power measurements) and modelling (density functional theory) techniques are employed to investigate the non-equilibrium solubility and clustering of Fe and Cr in binary Zr alloys. EOS Cr occupies both interstitial and substitutional sites in the \alpha -Zr lattice, Fe favours interstitial sites, and a low-symmetry site that was not previously modelled is found to be the most favourable for Fe.	Lattice expansion as a function of alloying concentration (in the dilute regime) is strongly anisotropic for Fe additions, expanding the _EQN_ -axis while contracting the _EQN_ -axis.
doc	Existence and Distribution of Solutions of a^x = b modulo p^n EOS Initial objective of this dissertation is to study the existence of the solutions of the congruence a^x = b^y (mod p^n) and distribution of solutions (x, y) as n varies in natural numbers, where a and b are integers coprime to prime p. EOS We observe that as n tends to infinity, solutions take the form of p-adic integers. EOS This motivates us, to study the existence of the solutions of equation a^x = b in p-adic integers. EOS The relevant case is when a and b are units in p-adic integers. EOS If the solution exists we try to find it out. EOS We resolve the case of a, b in U_1 completely. EOS A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the solution of a^x = b where a, b are elements of U_1, is `valuation of a-1 is smaller than the valuation of b-1'.	In this case, if the solution exists then it is given by log b / log a.

It is found that the relative eccentricity fluctuations in AMPT account for the observed elliptic flow fluctuations, in agreement with measurements of the STAR collaboration.

EOS All of the 76 LEP-2 allowed fermionic final state processes evaluated at tree level are included in version 1.1. EOS grc4f addresses event simulation requirements at e+e- colliders such as LEP and up-coming linear colliders. EOS Most of the attractive aspects of grc4f come from its link to the GRACE system: a Feynman diagram automatic computation system. EOS The GRACE system has been used to produce the computational code for all final states, giving a higher level of confidence in the calculation correctness.	Based on the helicity amplitude calculation technique, all fermion masses can be kept finite and helicity information can be propagated down to the final state particles.

doc	Probing nuclear dynamics in jet production with a global event shape EOS We study single jet production in electron-nucleus collisions e^- + N_A -> J + X, using the 1-jettiness (\tau_1) global event shape. EOS It inclusively quantifies the pattern of radiation in the final state, gives enhanced sensitivity to soft radiation at wide angles from the nuclear beam and final-state jet, and facilitates the resummation of large Sudakov logarithms associated with the veto on additional jets. EOS Through their effect on the observed pattern of radiation, 1-jettiness can be a useful probe of nuclear PDFs and power corrections from dynamical effects in the nuclear medium.	This formalism allows for the standard jet shape analysis while simultaneously providing sensitivity to soft radiation at wide angles from the jet.

Examples treated are the sector of a disk and a circular crescent.
doc	Secure Transmission of Sources over Noisy Channels with Side Information at the Receivers EOS This paper investigates the problem of source-channel coding for secure transmission with arbitrarily correlated side informations at both receivers. EOS This scenario consists of an encoder (referred to as Alice) that wishes to compress a source and send it through a noisy channel to a legitimate receiver (referred to as Bob). EOS In this context, Alice must simultaneously satisfy the desired requirements on the distortion level at Bob, and the equivocation rate at the eavesdropper (referred to as Eve). EOS This setting can be seen as a generalization of the problems of secure source coding with (uncoded) side information at the decoders, and the wiretap channel. EOS A general outer bound on the rate-distortion-equivocation region, as well as an inner bound based on a pure digital scheme, is derived for arbitrary channels and side informations. EOS In some special cases of interest, it is proved that this digital scheme is optimal and that separation holds. EOS However, it is also shown through a simple counterexample with a binary source that a pure analog scheme can outperform the digital one while being optimal. EOS According to these observations and assuming matched bandwidth, a novel hybrid digital/analog scheme that aims to gather the advantages of both digital and analog ones is then presented. EOS In the quadratic Gaussian setup when side information is only present at the eavesdropper, this strategy is proved to be optimal. EOS Furthermore, it outperforms both digital and analog schemes, and cannot be achieved via time-sharing.	By means of an appropriate coding, the presence of any statistical difference among the side informations, the channel noises, and the distortion at Bob can be fully exploited in terms of secrecy.

The broadband spectrum of the source is dominated at low energies (E < 2 keV) by a strong excess of emission and by complex emission/absorption features between 5.5-8.0 keV.
doc	The Intrinsic Flat Distance between Riemannian Manifolds and other Integral Current Spaces EOS Inspired by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, we define the intrinsic flat distance between oriented _EQN_ dimensional Riemannian manifolds with boundary by isometrically embedding the manifolds into a common metric space, measuring the flat distance between them and taking an infimum over all isometric embeddings and all common metric spaces. EOS This is made rigorous by applying Ambrosio-Kirchheim's extension of Federer-Fleming's notion of integral currents to arbitrary metric spaces. EOS We prove the intrinsic flat distance between two compact oriented Riemannian manifolds is zero iff they have an orientation preserving isometry between them.	Using the theory of Ambrosio-Kirchheim, we study converging sequences of manifolds and their limits, which are in a class of metric spaces that we call integral current spaces.
doc	Long-range Entanglement of Kondo Clouds in Open Triple Quantum Dots EOS We study entanglement of Kondo clouds in an open triple quantum dots (OTQDs) system based on the dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) theory. EOS A comprehensive picture of the long-range entanglement of Kondo clouds is sketched by the spectral functions, spin-spin correlation and dot occupancies of OTQDs. EOS We find that for the configuration (N1,N2,N3) = (1, 0, 1), a conduction electrons peak occurs in the spectral function of intermediate QD in Kondo regime. EOS This peak resulting from the overlapping of the two Kondo clouds forming from between the two peripheral QDs and leads, enhances with decreasing temperature and increasing dot-lead coupling.	Both the spin-spin correlations between the two adjacent QDs and the two peripheral QDs owns negative values.
doc	Gravity's rainbow EOS Could COBE DMR be detecting the imprint from a spectrum of gravitational waves generated during inflation?

doc	Simultaneous Noise and Impedance Fitting to Transition-Edge Sensor Data using Differential Evolution EOS We discuss a robust method to simultaneously fit a complex model both to the complex impedance and the noise data for transition-edge sensors (TES). EOS It is based on a differential evolution (DE) algorithm, providing accurate and repeatable results with only a small increase in computational cost compared to the standard least squares (LS) fitting method. EOS Test fits are made using both DE and LS methods, and the results compared with previously determined best fits, with varying initial value deviations and limit ranges for the parameters.	The robustness of DE is demonstrated with successful fits even when parameter limits up to a factor of 5 from the known values were used.
doc	Initial Conditions of Inhomogeneous Universe and the Cosmological Constant Problem EOS Deriving the Einstein field equations (EFE) with matter fluid from the action principle is not straightforward, because mass conservation must be added as an additional constraint to make rest-frame mass density variable in reaction to metric variation. EOS This can be avoided by introducing a constraint _EQN_ to metric variations _EQN_, and then the cosmological constant _EQN_ emerges as an integration constant. EOS This is a removal of one of the four constraints on initial conditions forced by EFE at the birth of the universe, and it may imply that EFE are unnecessarily restrictive about initial conditions. EOS I then adopt a principle that the theory of gravity should be able to solve time evolution starting from arbitrary inhomogeneous initial conditions about spacetime and matter. EOS The equations of gravitational fields satisfying this principle are obtained, by setting four auxiliary constraints on _EQN_ to extract six degrees of freedom for gravity. EOS The cost of achieving this is a loss of general covariance, but these equations constitute a consistent theory if they hold in the special coordinate systems that can be uniquely specified with respect to the initial space-like hypersurface when the universe was born. EOS This theory predicts that gravity is described by EFE with non-zero _EQN_ in a homogeneous patch of the universe created by inflation, but _EQN_ changes continuously across different patches.	Then both the smallness and coincidence problems of the cosmological constant are solved by the anthropic argument.
doc	Spatial Fluctuations of Helical Dirac Fermions on the Surface of Topological Insulators EOS Surfaces of topological insulators host a new class of states with Dirac dispersion and helical spin texture. EOS Potential quantum computing and spintronic applications using these states require manipulation of their electronic properties at the Dirac energy of their band structure by inducing magnetism or superconductivity through doping and proximity effect. EOS Yet, the response of these states near the Dirac energy in their band structure to various perturbations has remained unexplored. EOS Here we use spectroscopic mapping with the scanning tunneling microscope to study their response to magnetic and non-magnetic bulk dopants in Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3. EOS Far from the Dirac energy helicity provides remarkable resilience to backscattering even in the presence of ferromagnetism. EOS However, approaching the Dirac point, where the surface states' wavelength diverges bulk doping results in pronounced nanoscale spatial fluctuations of energy, momentum, and helicity.	Our results and their connection with similar studies of Dirac electrons in graphene demonstrate that while backscattering and localization are absent for Dirac topological surface states, reducing charge defects is required for both tuning the chemical potential to Dirac energy and achieving high electrical mobility for these novel states.

doc	Constraints in Hamiltonian time-dependent mechanics EOS In Hamiltonian time-dependent mechanics, the Poisson bracket does not define dynamic equations, that implies the corresponding peculiarities of describing time-dependent holonomic constraints.

However, the Poisson bracket of constraints and a Hamiltonian makes no sense.
doc	The stellar initial mass function in red-sequence galaxies: 1-micron spectroscopy of Coma Cluster galaxies with Subaru/FMOS EOS To investigate possible variations in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in red-sequence galaxies, we have obtained infrared spectroscopy with Subaru/FMOS for a sample of 92 red-sequence galaxies in the Coma cluster. EOS Velocity dispersions, ages and element abundances for these galaxies have been previously determined from optical data.	By stacking the FMOS spectra in the rest frame, removing sky-subtraction residuals and other artefacts fixed in the observed frame, we derive composite spectra in the 9600-10500 Angstrom range for galaxies grouped according to their velocity dispersion or Mg/Fe ratio.
doc	Using Sohn's law of additive reaction times for modeling a multiparticle reactor. The case of the moving bed furnace converting uranium trioxide into tetrafluoride EOS One of the major issues with multiparticle reactors is to handle their multiscale aspect. EOS For modeling, it usually comes to coupling a reactor model (describing the phenomena at the macroscopic scale) with a so-called grain model (simulating the behavior of a single grain or a particle).	An interesting approach proposed by H.Y.
doc	A hyperelastic model for simulating cells in flow EOS In the emerging field of 3D bioprinting, cell damage due to large deformations is considered a main cause for cell death and loss of functionality inside the printed construct. EOS Those deformations, in turn, strongly depend on the mechano-elastic response of the cell to the hydrodynamic stresses experienced during printing. EOS In this work, we present a numerical model to simulate the deformation of biological cells in arbitrary three-dimensional flows. EOS We consider cells as an elastic continuum according to the hyperelastic Mooney-Rivlin model. EOS We then employ force calculations on a tetrahedralized volume mesh. EOS To validate our model, we perform a series of FluidFM(R) compression experiments with REF52 cells demonstrating that our hyperelastic model provides a very good description of the experimental data even at very large deformations up to 80%. EOS In addition, we validate the model by comparing to axisymmetric simulations and to previous AFM experiments on bovine endothelial cells and artificial hydrogel particles.	To investigate cell deformation in flow, we incorporate our model into Lattice Boltzmann simulations via an Immersed-Boundary algorithm.

doc	Tunable multiwindow magnomechanically induced transparency, Fano resonances, and slow-to-fast light conversion EOS We investigate the absorption and transmission properties of a weak probe field under the influence of a strong control field in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system in the microwave regime. EOS This hybrid system consists of two ferromagnetic material yttrium iron garnet (YIG) spheres strongly coupled to a single cavity mode. EOS In addition to two magnon-induced transparency (MIT) that arise due to strong photon-magnon interactions, we observe a magnomechanically induced transparency (MMIT) due to the presence of nonlinear phonon-magnon interaction. EOS In addition, we discuss the emergence and tunability of the multiple Fano resonances in our system. EOS We find that due to strong photon-magnon coupling the group delay of the probe field can be enhanced significantly.	The subluminal or superluminal propagation depends on the frequency of the magnons, which can be easily tuned by an external bias magnetic field.
doc	Almost Gone: SN~2008S and NGC~300 2008OT-1 are Fainter than their Progenitors EOS We present late-time Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescope imaging of SN 2008S and NGC 300 2008OT-1, the prototypes of a common class of stellar transients whose true nature is debated. EOS Both objects are still fading and are now >15 times fainter than the progenitors in the mid-IR and are undetected in the optical and near-IR. EOS Data from the Large Binocular Telescope and Magellan show that neither source has been variable in the optical since fading in 2010.	We present models of surviving sources obscured by dusty shells or winds and find that extreme dust models are needed for surviving stars to be successfully hidden by dust.

doc	Models of OH Maser Variations in U Her EOS Arecibo spectra of the mainline OH maser emission from U Her over more than a decade show variations of the OH emission over these time scales. EOS These observations are combined with high spatial resolution VLBA maps to investigate the causes of the variations in the velocities of the maser components. EOS Global properties of the dust shell, such as accelerations, variations in the pump and shell-wide magnetic field changes are examined as possibilities, and eliminated. EOS A possible solution to the problem involving plasma turbulence and the local magnetic field is introduced, and the relevant time scales of the turbulence are calculated. EOS The turbulent velocity field yields time scales of the turbulence are calculated.	The turbulent velocity field yields time scales that are too long (of order centuries), while the turbulent magnetic field produces variations on appropriate time scales of a few years.
doc	A Computer-Aided Diagnosis System Using Artificial Intelligence for Hip Fractures -Multi-Institutional Joint Development Research- EOS [Objective] To develop a Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for plane frontal hip X-rays with a deep learning model trained on a large dataset collected at multiple centers. EOS [Materials and Methods]. EOS We included 5295 cases with neck fracture or trochanteric fracture who were diagnosed and treated by orthopedic surgeons using plane X-rays or computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who visited each institution between April 2009 and March 2019 were enrolled. EOS Cases in which both hips were not included in the photographing range, femoral shaft fractures, and periprosthetic fractures were excluded, and 5242 plane frontal pelvic X-rays obtained from 4,851 cases were used for machine learning. EOS These images were divided into 5242 images including the fracture side and 5242 images without the fracture side, and a total of 10484 images were used for machine learning. EOS A deep convolutional neural network approach was used for machine learning. EOS Pytorch 1.3 and Fast.ai 1.0 were used as frameworks, and EfficientNet-B4, which is pre-trained ImageNet model, was used. EOS In the final evaluation, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-value and area under the curve (AUC) were evaluated.	Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to conceptualize the diagnostic basis of the CAD system.

doc	Statistical mechanics of semiflexible ribbon polymers EOS The statistical mechanics of a ribbon polymer made up of two semiflexible chains is studied using both analytical techniques and simulation. EOS The system is found to have a crossover transition at some finite temperature, from a type of short range order to a fundamentally different sort of short range order. EOS In the high temperature regime, the 2-point correlation functions of the object are identical to worm-like chains, while in the low temperature regime they are different due to a twist structure. EOS The crossover happens when the persistence length of individual strands becomes comparable to the thickness of the ribbon. EOS In the low temperature regime, the ribbon is observed to have a novel ``kink-rod'' structure with a mutual exclusion of twist and bend in contrast to smooth worm-like chain behaviour. EOS This is due to its anisotropic rigidity and corresponds to an infinitely strong twist-bend coupling.	The double-stranded polymer is also studied in a confined geometry.

doc	Non-perturbative landscape of the Mott-Hubbard transition: Multiple divergence lines around the critical endpoint EOS We analyze the highly non-perturbative regime surrounding the Mott-Hubbard metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) by means of dynamical mean field theory calculations at the two-particle level. EOS By extending the results of Sch\"afer, et al [Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS 110, 246405 (2013)] we show the existence of infinitely many lines in the phase diagram of the Hubbard model where the local Bethe-Salpeter equations, and the related irreducible vertex functions, become singular in the charge as well as the particle-particle channel. EOS These divergence lines accumulate around the critical Mott endpoint in accordance with the interpretation as precursors of the MIT.	By comparing our numerical data with analytical calculations of increasing complexity, such as for the disordered Binary Mixture and Falicov-Kimball (FK) models, as well as for the atomic limit (AL) case, (i) we identify two different kinds of divergences lines;
doc	Risk and interaction aversion: screening mechanisms in the Prisoner's Dilemma game EOS When the interactions between cooperators (C) and defectors (D) can be partially avoided within a population, there may be an overall enhancement of cooperation. EOS One example of such screening mechanism occurs in the presence of risk-averse agents (loners, L) that are neutral towards others, i.e., both L and its opponent, whatever its strategy, receive the same payoff. EOS Their presence in the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game sustains the coexistence of cooperators and defectors far beyond the level attained in their absence. EOS Another screening mechanism is a heterogeneous landscape obtained, for example, by site diluting the lattice. EOS In this case, cooperation is enhanced with some fraction of such inactive, interaction-averse sites.	By considering the interplay of both mechanisms, we show that there is an explosive increase in the range of densities, just above the percolation threshold, where neutrality is prevented and loners become extinct, the behavior reverting to the pure PD game.
doc	Strong and complex electron-lattice correlation in optimally doped Bi _EQN_ Sr _EQN_ CaCu _EQN_ O _EQN_ EOS We discuss the nature of electron-lattice interaction in optimally doped Bi _EQN_ Sr _EQN_ CaCu _EQN_ O _EQN_ samples, using isotope effect (IE) in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data. EOS The IE in the ARPES line width and the IE in the ARPES dispersion are both quite large, implying a strong electron-lattice correlation. EOS The strength of the electron-lattice interaction is ``intermediate,'' i.e. EOS stronger than the Migdal-Eliashberg regime but weaker than the small polaron regime, requiring a more general picture of the ARPES ``kink'' than the commonly used Migdal-Eliashberg picture. EOS The two IEs also imply a complex interaction, due to their strong momentum dependence and their differing sign behaviors.	In sum, we propose an intermediate-strength coupling of electrons to localized lattice vibrations via charge density fluctuations.

doc	New solutions of exotic charged black holes and their stability EOS We find a class of charged black hole solutions in third order Lovelock Gravity. EOS To obtain this class of solutions, we are not confined to the usual assumption of maximal symmetry on the horizon and will consider the solution whose boundary is Einstein space with supplementary conditions on its Weyl tensor. EOS The Weyl tensor of such exotic horizons exposes two charge-like parameter to the solution. EOS These parameters in addition with the electric charge, cause different features in compare with the charged solution with constant-curvature horizon.	For this class of asymptotically (A)dS solutions, the electric charge dominates the behavior of the metric as r goes to zero, and thus the central singularity is always timelike.

doc	Smoothed and Average-case Approximation Ratios of Mechanisms: Beyond the Worst-case Analysis EOS The approximation ratio has become one of the dominant measures in mechanism design problems. EOS In light of analysis of algorithms, we define the ph smoothed approximation ratio to compare the performance of the optimal mechanism and a truthful mechanism when the inputs are subject to random perturbations of the worst-case inputs, and define the ph average-case approximation ratio to compare the performance of these two mechanisms when the inputs follow a distribution. EOS For the one-sided matching problem, REF FFZ:14 show that, amongst all truthful mechanisms, ph random priority achieves the tight approximation ratio bound of _EQN_.	We prove that, despite of this worst-case bound, random priority has a ph constant smoothed approximation ratio.

EOS Tracking systems based on fiber Bragg gratings are an emerging technology for the navigation of minimal-invasive instruments which can reduce the x-ray exposure and the used contrast agent. EOS Shape sensing of flexible structures is challenging and includes many calculations steps which are prone to different errors. EOS To reduce this errors, we present an optimized shape sensing model. EOS Methods: We analyzed for every step of the shape sensing process, which errors can occur, how the error affects the shape and how it can be compensated or minimized. EOS Experiments were done with a multicore fiber system with 38 cm sensing length and the effects of different methods and parameters were analyzed.	Furthermore we compared 3D shape reconstructions with the segmented shape of the corresponding CT scans of the fiber to evaluate the accuracy of our optimized shape sensing model.

EOS In this work we calculate several characteristics of the L1 _EQN_ FeNi, where most of the results come form the fully relativistic full potential FPLO method with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). EOS A special attention deserves the summary of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies (MAE's), the full potential calculations of the anisotropy constant _EQN_, and the combined analysis of the Fermi surface and three-dimensional _EQN_ -resolved MAE. EOS Other calculated parameters presented in this article are the magnetic moments _EQN_ and _EQN_, magnetostrictive coefficient _EQN_, bulk modulus B _EQN_, and lattice parameters.	The MAE's summary shows rather big discrepancies between the experimental MAE's from literature and also between the calculated MAE's.

doc	SlowFuzz: Automated Domain-Independent Detection of Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerabilities EOS Algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities occur when the worst-case time/space complexity of an application is significantly higher than the respective average case for particular user-controlled inputs. EOS When such conditions are met, an attacker can launch Denial-of-Service attacks against a vulnerable application by providing inputs that trigger the worst-case behavior. EOS Such attacks have been known to have serious effects on production systems, take down entire websites, or lead to bypasses of Web Application Firewalls. EOS Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms for algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities are domain-specific and often require significant manual effort. EOS In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate SlowFuzz, a domain-independent framework for automatically finding algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities. EOS SlowFuzz automatically finds inputs that trigger worst-case algorithmic behavior in the tested binary.	SlowFuzz uses resource-usage-guided evolutionary search techniques to automatically find inputs that maximize computational resource utilization for a given application.
doc	Comprehensive Study of a z = 2.35 DLA Galaxy: Mass, Metallicity, Age, Morphology and SFR from HST and VLT EOS We present a detailed study of the emission from a z = 2.35 galaxy that causes damped Lyman-alpha absorption in the spectrum of the background QSO, SDSS J 2222-0946. EOS We present the results of extensive analyses of the stellar continuum covering the rest frame optical-UV regime based on broad-band HST imaging, and of spectroscopy from VLT/X-Shooter of the strong emission lines: Ly-alpha, [OII], [OIII], [NII], H-alpha and H-beta. EOS We compare the metallicity from the absorption lines in the QSO spectrum with the oxygen abundance inferred from the strong-line methods (R23 and N2). EOS The two emission-line methods yield consistent results: [O/H] = -0.30+/-0.13. EOS Based on the absorption lines in the QSO spectrum a metallicity of -0.49+/-0.05 is inferred at an impact parameter of 6.3 kpc from the centre of the galaxy with a column density of hydrogen of log(N_HI)=20.65+/-0.05. EOS The star formation rates of the galaxy from the UV continuum and H-alpha line can be reconciled assuming an amount of reddening of E(B-V) = 0.06+/-0.01, giving an inferred SFR of 13+/-1 M_sun / yr (assuming a Chabrier IMF).	From the HST imaging, the galaxy associated with the absorption is found to be a compact (re=1.12 kpc) object with a disc-like, elongated (axis ratio 0.17) structure indicating that the galaxy is seen close to edge on.
doc	Aspects of Time in Quantum Theory EOS We consider a number of aspects of the problem of defining time observables in quantum theory. EOS Time observables are interesting quantities in quantum theory because they often cannot be associated with self-adjoint operators. EOS Their definition therefore touches on foundational issues in quantum theory. EOS Various operational approaches to defining time observables have been proposed in the past. EOS Two of the most common are those based on pulsed measurements in the form of strings of projection operators and continuous measurements in the form of complex potentials. EOS One of the major achievements of this thesis is to prove that these two operational approaches are equivalent. EOS However operational approaches are somewhat unsatisfying by themselves. EOS To provide a definition of time observables which is not linked to a particular measurement scheme we employ the decoherent, or consistent, histories approach to quantum theory. EOS We focus on the arrival time, one particular example of a time observable, and we use the relationship between pulsed and continuous measurements to relate the decoherent histories approach to one based on complex potentials.	This lets us compute the arrival time probability distribution in decoherent histories and we show that it agrees with semiclassical expectations in the right limit.
doc	Minimal symmetric Darlington synthesis EOS We consider the symmetric Darlington synthesis of a p x p rational symmetric Schur function S with the constraint that the extension is of size 2p x 2p. EOS Under the assumption that S is strictly contractive in at least one point of the imaginary axis, we determine the minimal McMillan degree of the extension. EOS In particular, we show that it is generically given by the number of zeros of odd multiplicity of I-SS*.	A constructive characterization of all such extensions is provided in terms of a symmetric realization of S and of the outer spectral factor of I-SS*.
doc	Impact of Grid Tariffs Design on the Zero Emission Neighborhoods Energy System Investments EOS This paper investigates the relationship between grid tariffs and investment in Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN) energy system, and how the grid exchanges are affected. EOS Different grid tariffs (energy based, time of use (ToU), subscribed capacity and dynamic) are implemented in an optimization model that minimizes the cost of investing and operating a ZEN during its lifetime. EOS The analysis is conducted in two cases: non-constrained exports and exports limited to 100kWh/h. EOS The results suggest that in the case with no limit on export, the grid tariff has little influence, but ToU is economically advantageous for both the ZEN and the DSO.	When exports are limited, the subscribed capacity scheme allows to maintain DSO revenue, while the others cut them by half.
doc	Effect of the Heterogeneity of Metamaterials on Casimir-Lifshitz Interaction EOS The Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between metamaterials is studied using a model that takes into account the structural heterogeneity of the dielectric and magnetic properties of the bodies. EOS A recently developed perturbation theory for the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction between arbitrary material bodies is generalized to include non-uniform magnetic permeability profiles, and used to study the interaction between the magneto-dielectric heterostructures within the leading order. EOS The metamaterials are modeled as two dimensional arrays of domains with varying permittivity and permeability.	In the case of two semi-infinite bodies with flat boundaries, the patterned structure of the material properties is found to cause the normal Casimir-Lifshitz force to develop an oscillatory behavior when the distance between the two bodies is comparable to the wavelength of the patterned features in the metamaterials.

doc	Ultrafast observation of critical nematic fluctuations and giant magnetoelastic coupling in iron pnictides EOS Many of the iron pnictides have strongly anisotropic normal-state characteristics, important for the exotic magnetic and superconducting behavior these materials exhibit. EOS Yet, the origin of the observed anisotropy is unclear. EOS Electronically driven nematicity has been suggested, but distinguishing this as an independent degree of freedom from magnetic and structural orders is difficult, as these couple together to break the same tetragonal symmetry. EOS Here we use time-resolved polarimetry to reveal critical nematic fluctuations in unstrained Ba(Fe_(1-x)Co_x)_2As_2. EOS The femtosecond anisotropic response, which arises from the two-fold in-plane anisotropy of the complex refractive index, displays a characteristic two-step recovery absent in the isotropic response. EOS The fast recovery appears only in the magnetically ordered state, whereas the slow one persists in the paramagnetic phase with a critical divergence approaching the structural transition temperature.	The dynamics also reveal a gigantic magnetoelastic coupling that far exceeds electron-spin and electron-phonon couplings, opposite to conventional magnetic metals.
doc	Low Mach number effect in simulation of high Mach number flow EOS In this note, we relate the two well-known difficulties of Godunov schemes: the carbuncle phenomena in simulating high Mach number flow, and the inaccurate pressure profile in simulating low Mach number flow.

While the first modification increases the local numerical dissipation, the second decreases it.
doc	Vacuum Cherenkov radiation for Lorentz-violating fermions EOS The current work focuses on the process of vacuum Cherenkov radiation for Lorentz-violating fermions that are described by the minimal Standard-Model Extension (SME). EOS To date, most considerations of this important hypothetical process have been restricted to Lorentz-violating photons, as the necessary theoretical tools for the SME fermion sector have not been available. EOS With their development in a very recent paper, we are now in a position to compute the decay rates based on a modified Dirac theory. EOS Two realizations of the Cherenkov process are studied. EOS In the first scenario, the spin projection of the incoming fermion is assumed to be conserved, and in the second, the spin projection is allowed to flip. EOS The first type of process is shown to be still forbidden for the dimensionful _EQN_ and _EQN_ coefficients where there are strong indications that it is energetically disallowed for the _EQN_ coefficients, as well. EOS However, it is rendered possible for the dimensionless _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, and _EQN_ coefficients.	For large initial fermion energies, the decay rates for the _EQN_ and _EQN_ coefficients were found to grow linearly with momentum and to be linearly suppressed by the smallness of the Lorentz-violating coefficient where for the _EQN_, _EQN_, and _EQN_ coefficients this suppression is even quadratic.
doc	The Difference and Unity of Irregular LQ Control and Standard LQ Control and Its Solution EOS Irregular linear quadratic control (LQ, was called Singular LQ) has been a long-standing problem since 1970s. EOS This paper will show that an irregular LQ control (deterministic) is solvable (for arbitrary initial value) if and only if the LQ cost can be rewritten as a regular one by changing the terminal cost _EQN_ to _EQN_, while the optimal controller can achieve _EQN_ at the same time.	In other words, the irregular controller (if exists) needs to do two things at the same time, one thing is to minimize the cost and the other is to achieve the terminal constraint _EQN_, which clarifies the essential difference of irregular LQ from the standard LQ control where the controller is to minimize the cost only.
doc	On Bianchi type VI _EQN_ spacetimes with orthogonal perfect fluid matter EOS We study the asymptotic behaviour of Bianchi type VI _EQN_ spacetimes with orthogonal perfect fluid matter satisfying Einstein's equations. EOS In particular, we prove a conjecture due to Wainwright about the initial singularity on such backgrounds.	Using the expansion-normalized variables of Wainwright-Hsu, we demonstrate that for a generic solution the initial singularity is vacuum dominated, anisotropic and silent.
doc	Spatial networks evolving to reduce length EOS Motivated by results of Henry, Pralat and Zhang (PNAS 108.21 (2011): 8605-8610), we propose a general scheme for evolving spatial networks in order to reduce their total edge lengths. EOS We study the properties of the equilbria of two networks from this class, which interpolate between three well studied objects: the Erd\H o s-R\' e nyi random graph, the random geometric graph, and the minimum spanning tree.	The first of our two evolutions can be used as a model for a social network where individuals have fixed opinions about a number of issues and adjust their ties to be connected to people with similar views.

doc	On Uniform Capacitated _EQN_ -Median Beyond the Natural LP Relaxation EOS In this paper, we study the uniform capacitated _EQN_ -median problem. EOS Obtaining a constant approximation algorithm for this problem is a notorious open problem; EOS most previous works gave constant approximations by either violating the capacity constraints or the cardinality constraint. EOS Notably, all these algorithms are based on the natural LP-relaxation for the problem.	The LP-relaxation has unbounded integrality gap, even when we are allowed to violate the capacity constraints or the cardinality constraint by a factor of _EQN_.
doc	Quantitative assessment of computational models for retinotopic map formation EOS Molecular and activity-based cues acting together are thought to guide retinal axons to their terminal sites in vertebrate optic tectum or superior colliculus to form an ordered map of connections. EOS The details of mechanisms involved, and the degree to which they might interact, are still not well understood. EOS We have developed a framework within which existing computational models can be assessed in an unbiased and quantitative manner against a set of experimental data curated from the mouse retinocollicular system.	Our framework facilitates comparison between models, testing new models against known phenotypes and simulating new phenotypes in existing models.
doc	The gravitational S-matrix EOS We investigate the hypothesized existence of an S-matrix for gravity, and some of its expected general properties. EOS We first discuss basic questions regarding existence of such a matrix, including those of infrared divergences and description of asymptotic states.

doc	Effect of Loss on Multiplexed Single-Photon Sources EOS An on-demand single-photon source is a key requirement for scaling many optical quantum technologies. EOS A promising approach to realize an on-demand single-photon source is to multiplex an array of heralded single-photon sources using an active optical switching network. EOS However, the performance of multiplexed sources is degraded by photon loss in the optical components and the non-unit detection efficiency of the heralding detectors. EOS We provide a theoretical description of a general multiplexed single-photon source with lossy components and derive expressions for the output probabilities of single-photon emission and multi-photon contamination. EOS We apply these expressions to three specific multiplexing source architectures and consider their tradeoffs in design and performance. EOS To assess the effect of lossy components on near- and long-term experimental goals, we simulate the multiplexed sources when used for many-photon state generation under various amounts of component loss.	We find that with a multiplexed source composed of switches with ~0.2-0.4 dB loss and high efficiency number-resolving detectors, a single-photon source capable of efficiently producing 20-40 photon states with low multi-photon contamination is possible, offering the possibility of unlocking new classes of experiments and technologies.

doc	Confined hidden vector dark matter EOS We argue that the lightest vector bound states of a confining hidden sector communicating with the Standard Model through the Higgs portal are stable and are viable candidates of dark matter.	The model is based on an SU(2) gauge group with a scalar field in its fundamental representation and the stability of the lightest vector bound state results from the existence of a custodial symmetry.
doc	On the faces of the tensor cone of symmetrizable Kac-Moody lie algebras EOS In this paper, we are interested in the decomposition of the tensor product of two representations of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebra g, and more precisely in the tensor cone of g. EOS Let P + be the set of dominant integral weights. EOS For _EQN_ _EQN_ P +, L(_EQN_) denotes the (irreducible) integrable, highest weight representation of g with highest weight _EQN_. EOS Let P +,Q be the rational convex cone generated by P +. EOS Consider the tensor cone _EQN_ (g):= (_EQN_ 1, _EQN_ 2, _EQN_) _EQN_ P 3 +,Q: _EQN_ N _EQN_ 1 such that L(N _EQN_) _EQN_ L(N _EQN_ 1) _EQN_ L(N _EQN_ 2). EOS If g is finite dimensional, _EQN_ (g) is a polyhedral convex cone described in [BK06] by an explicit finite list of inequalities. EOS In [Res10] this list of inequalities is proved to be irredundant: each inequality corresponds to a codimension one face. EOS In general, _EQN_ (g) is neither polyhedral, nor closed.	Brown-Kumar [BK14] obtained a list of inequalities that describe _EQN_ (g) conjecturally.
doc	How macroscopic laws describe complex dynamics: asymptomatic population and CoviD-19 spreading EOS Macroscopic growth laws, solutions of mean field equations, describe in an effective way an underlying complex dynamics. EOS They are applied to study the spreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19, where the counting of the cumulated number _EQN_ of detected infected individuals is a generally accepted, coarse-grain, variable to understand the epidemic phase. EOS However _EQN_ does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not detected, cases _EQN_. EOS Therefore, the question arises if the observed time series of data of _EQN_ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution of the infectious disease. EOS We study a system of coupled differential equations which includes the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation.	The solution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for the population _EQN_ coming from a single, non-linear, differential equation with no explicit reference to _EQN_, showing the equivalence of the two methods.

doc	Dynamics in Non-Globally-Hyperbolic Static Spacetimes III: Anti-de Sitter Spacetime EOS In recent years, there has been considerable interest in theories formulated in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. EOS However, AdS spacetime fails to be globally hyperbolic, so a classical field satisfying a hyperbolic wave equation on AdS spacetime need not have a well defined dynamics. EOS Nevertheless, AdS spacetime is static, so the possible rules of dynamics for a field satisfying a linear wave equation are constrained by our previous general analysis--given in paper II--where it was shown that the possible choices of dynamics correspond to choices of positive, self-adjoint extensions of a certain differential operator, _EQN_. EOS In the present paper, we reduce the analysis of electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in AdS spacetime to scalar wave equations. EOS We then apply our general results to analyse the possible dynamics of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in AdS spacetime.	In AdS spacetime, the freedom (if any) in choosing self-adjoint extensions of _EQN_ corresponds to the freedom (if any) in choosing suitable boundary conditions at infinity, so our analysis determines all of the possible boundary conditions that can be imposed at infinity.
doc	Symmetric Nonnegative Tensors and Copositive Tensors EOS We first prove two new spectral properties for symmetric nonnegative tensors. EOS We prove a maximum property for the largest H-eigenvalue of a symmetric nonnegative tensor, and establish some bounds for this eigenvalue via row sums of that tensor. EOS We show that if an eigenvalue of a symmetric nonnegative tensor has a positive H-eigenvector, then this eigenvalue is the largest H-eigenvalue of that tensor. EOS We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for this. EOS We then introduce copositive tensors.	This concept extends the concept of copositive matrices.
doc	Adaptive Decoding of LDPC Codes with Binary Messages EOS A novel adaptive binary decoding algorithm for LDPC codes is proposed, which reduces the decoding complexity while having a comparable or even better performance than corresponding non-adaptive alternatives. EOS In each iteration the variable node decoders use the binary check node decoders multiple times;	each single use is referred to as a sub-iteration.
doc	Non-Divergence of Unipotent Flows on Quotients of Rank One Semisimple Groups EOS Let _EQN_ be a semisimple Lie group of rank _EQN_ and _EQN_ be a torsion free discrete subgroup of _EQN_. EOS We show that in _EQN_, given _EQN_, any trajectory of a unipotent flow remains in the set of points with injectivity radius larger than _EQN_ for _EQN_ proportion of the time for some _EQN_. EOS The result also holds for any finitely generated discrete subgroup _EQN_ and this generalizes Dani's quantitative nondivergence theorem REF for lattices of rank one semisimple groups.	Furthermore, for a fixed _EQN_ there exists an injectivity radius _EQN_ such that for any unipotent trajectory _EQN_, either it spends at least _EQN_ proportion of the time in the set with injectivity radius larger than _EQN_ for all large _EQN_ or there exists a _EQN_ -normalized abelian subgroup _EQN_ of _EQN_ which intersects _EQN_ in a small covolume lattice.

EOS This article describes a synthesis of three strands of our work on fine-grained analysis of conversational interaction in peer tutoring at the paralinguistic and verbal levels, in an attempt to better understand the phenomenon of behavioral convergence and its relationship to social and cognitive constructs.	Implications for development of socially-aware agents that can improve task performance through convergence to and from the human learner's behavior are discussed.
doc	On universality of algebraic decays in Hamiltonian systems EOS Hamiltonian systems with a mixed phase space typically exhibit an algebraic decay of correlations and of Poincare' recurrences, with numerical experiments over finite times showing system-dependent power-law exponents. EOS We conjecture the existence of a universal asymptotic decay based on results for a Markov tree model with random scaling factors for the transition probabilities.	Numerical simulations for different Hamiltonian systems support this conjecture and permit the determination of the universal exponent.
doc	A study of jet mass distributions with grooming EOS We perform a phenomenological study of the invariant mass distribution of hadronic jets produced in proton-proton collisions, in conjunction a grooming algorithm. EOS In particular, we consider the modified MassDrop Tagger (mMDT), which corresponds to Soft Drop with angular exponent _EQN_. EOS Our calculation, which is differential in both jet mass and jet transverse momentum, resums large logarithms of the jet mass, including the full dependence on the groomer's energy threshold _EQN_, and it is matched to fixed-order QCD matrix elements at next-to-leading order.	In order to account for non-perturbative contributions, originating from the hadronisation process and from the underlying event, we also include a phenomenological correction factor derived from Monte Carlo parton-shower simulations.
doc	Quantum and Classical Gauge Symmetries in a Modified Quantization Scheme EOS The use of the mass term as a gauge fixing term has been studied by Zwanziger, Parrinello and Jona-Lasinio, which is related to the non-linear gauge _EQN_ of Dirac and Nambu in the large mass limit. EOS We have recently shown that this modified quantization scheme is in fact identical to the conventional local Faddeev-Popov formula without taking the large mass limit, if one takes into account the variation of the gauge field along the entire gauge orbit and if the Gribov complications can be ignored.	This suggests that the classical massive vector theory, for example, is interpreted in a more flexible manner either as a gauge invariant theory with a gauge fixing term added, or as a conventional massive non-gauge theory.
doc	Using Multitask Learning to Improve 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Classification EOS We develop a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify multiple diagnoses from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) using a dataset comprised of over 40,000 ECGs, with labels derived from cardiologist clinical interpretations. EOS Since many clinically important classes can occur in low frequencies, approaches are needed to improve performance on rare classes. EOS We compare the performance of several single-class classifiers on rare classes to a multi-headed classifier across all available classes. EOS We demonstrate that the addition of common classes can significantly improve CNN performance on rarer classes when compared to a model trained on the rarer class in isolation.	Using this method, we develop a model with high performance as measured by F1 score on multiple clinically relevant classes compared against the gold-standard cardiologist interpretation.
doc	The HNC/HCN Ratio in Star-Forming Regions EOS HNC and HCN, typically used as dense gas tracers in molecular clouds, are a pair of isomers that have great potential as a temperature probe because of temperature dependent, isomer-specific formation and destruction pathways. EOS Previous observations of the HNC/HCN abundance ratio show that the ratio decreases with increasing temperature, something that standard astrochemical models cannot reproduce.	We have undertaken a detailed parameter study on which environmental characteristics and chemical reactions affect the HNC/HCN ratio and can thus contribute to the observed dependence.
doc	Rotation, differential rotation, and gyrochronology of active Kepler stars EOS The high-precision photometry from the CoRoT and Kepler satellites has led to measurements of surface rotation periods for tens of thousands of stars. EOS Our main goal is to derive ages of thousands of field stars using consistent rotation period measurements in different gyrochronology relations. EOS Multiple rotation periods are interpreted as surface differential rotation (DR). EOS We re-analyze the sample of 24,124 Kepler stars from Reinhold et al (2013) using different approaches based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. EOS Each quarter (Q1-Q14) is treated individually using a prewhitening approach. EOS Additionally, the full time series, and different segments thereof are analyzed. EOS For more than 18,500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from McQuillan et al (2014). EOS Thereof, more than 12,300 stars show multiple significant peaks, which we interpret as DR. EOS Gyrochronology ages between 100 Myr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17,000 stars using different gyrochronology relations. EOS We find a bimodal age distribution for Teff between 3200-4700 K. EOS The derived ages reveal an empirical activity-age relation using photometric variability as stellar activity proxy. EOS Additionally, we found 1079 stars with extremely stable (mostly short) periods. EOS Half of these periods may be associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other half might be due to pulsations. EOS The derived gyrochronology ages are well constrained since more than 93.0 % of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun where calibration is most reliable. EOS Explaining the bimodality in the age distribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions.	The existence of cool stars with almost constant rotation period over more than three years of observation might be explained by synchronization with stellar companions, or a dynamo mechanism keeping the spot configurations extremely stable.
doc	The Implementation of Low-cost Urban Acoustic Monitoring Devices EOS The urban sound environment of New York City (NYC) can be, amongst other things: loud, intrusive, exciting and dynamic. EOS As indicated by the large majority of noise complaints registered with the NYC 311 information/complaints line, the urban sound environment has a profound effect on the quality of life of the city's inhabitants. EOS To monitor and ultimately understand these sonic environments, a process of long-term acoustic measurement and analysis is required.	The traditional method of environmental acoustic monitoring utilizes short term measurement periods using expensive equipment, setup and operated by experienced and costly personnel.

doc	Guaranteed epsilon-optimal treatment plans with minimum number of beams for stereotactic body radiation therapy EOS Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is characterized by delivering a high amount of dose in a short period of time. EOS In SBRT the dose is delivered using open fields (e.g., beam's-eye-view) known as "apertures". EOS Mathematical methods can be used for optimizing treatment planning for delivery of sufficient dose to the cancerous cells while keeping the dose to surrounding organs at risk (OARs) minimal. EOS Two important elements of a treatment plan are quality and delivery time. EOS Quality of a plan is measured based on the target coverage and dose to OARs. EOS Delivery time heavily depends on the number of beams used in the plan since the setup times for different beam directions constitute a large portion of the delivery time. EOS Therefore the ideal plan, in which all potential beams can be used simultaneously, will be associated with a long impractical delivery time. EOS We use the dose to OARs in the ideal plan to find the plan with the minimum number of beams which is guaranteed to be epsilon-optimal (i.e., a predetermined maximum deviation from the ideal plan is guaranteed). EOS Since the treatment plan optimization is inherently a multicriteria optimization problem, the planner can navigate the ideal dose distribution Pareto surface and select a plan of desired target coverage versus OARs sparing, and then use the proposed technique to reduce the number of beams while guaranteeing epsilon-optimality. EOS We use mixed integer programming (MIP) for optimization.	To reduce the computation time for the resultant MIP, we use two heuristics: a beam elimination scheme and a family of heuristic cuts, known as "neighbor cuts", based on the concept of "adjacent beams".

doc	Negative Energy, Superluminosity and Holography EOS The holographic connection between large _EQN_ Super Yang Mills theory and gravity in anti deSitter space requires unfamiliar behavior of the SYM theory in the limit that the curvature of the AdS geometry becomes small. EOS The paradoxical behavior includes superluminal oscillations and negative energy density. EOS These effects typically occur in the SYM description of events which take place far from the boundary of AdS when the signal from the event arrives at the boundary. EOS The paradoxes can be resolved by assuming a very rich collection of hidden degrees of freedom of the SYM theory which store information but give rise to no local energy density. EOS These degrees of freedom, called precursors, are needed to make possible sudden apparently acausal energy momentum flows. EOS Such behavior would be impossible in classical field theory as a consequence of the positivity of the energy density.	However we show that these effects are not only allowed in quantum field theory but that we can model them in free quantum field theory.
doc	Random copolymers at a selective interface: many chains with excluded volume interactions EOS We investigate numerically, using the bond-fluctuation model, the adsorption of many random AB--copolymers with excluded volume interactions at the interface between two solvents. EOS We find two regimes, controlled by the total number of polymers. EOS In the first (dilute) regime, the copolymers near the interface extend parallel to it, while in the second regime they extend perpendicular to it.	The density at the interface and the density in the bulk depend differently on the total number of copolymers: In the first regime the density at the interface increases more rapidly then in the bulk, whereas the opposite is true in the second regime.
doc	Fixed Points of Torus Action and Cohomology Ring of Toric Varieties EOS Let X be a smooth simplicial toric variety. EOS Let Z be the set of T-fixed points of X. EOS We construct a filtration for A(Z), the ring of complex-valued functions on Z, such that Gr A(Z) is isomorphic to the cohomology algebra of X. EOS This is the explanation of the general results of Carrell and Liebermann on the cohomology of T-varities, in the case of toric varieties.	We give an explicit isomorphism between Gr A(Z) and Brion's description of the polytope algebra.

doc	Large Radio Telescopes for Anomalous Microwave Emission Observations EOS We discuss in this paper the problem of the Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) in the light of ongoing or future observations to be performed with the largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world. EOS High angular resolution observations of the AME will enable astronomers to drastically improve the knowledge of the AME mechanisms as well as the interplay between the different constituents of the interstellar medium in our galaxy. EOS Extragalactic observations of the AME have started as well, and high resolution is even more important in this kind of observations. EOS When cross-correlating with IR-dust emission, high angular resolution is also of fundamental importance in order to obtain unbiased results. EOS The choice of the observational frequency is also of key importance in continuum observation. EOS We calculate a merit function that accounts for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in AME observation given the current state-of-the-art knowledge and technology. EOS We also include in our merit functions the frequency dependence in the case of multifrequency observations.	We briefly mention and compare the performance of four of the largest radiotelescopes in the world and hope the observational programs in each of them will be as intense as possible.

EOS We propose a new algorithm for predicting depth maps from multiple viewpoints, with a single depth or RGB image as input. EOS By modifying the network and the way models are evaluated, we can directly compare the merits of voxels vs. EOS surfaces and viewer-centered vs. EOS object-centered for familiar vs. EOS unfamiliar objects, as predicted from RGB or depth images. EOS Among our findings, we show that surface-based methods outperform voxel representations for objects from novel classes and produce higher resolution outputs.	We also find that using viewer-centered coordinates is advantageous for novel objects, while object-centered representations are better for more familiar objects.

EOS From the many-body Schr\" o dinger-Newton equation follows an approximate equation for the center-of-mass dynamics of macroscopic objects.	This predicts a distinctive double-peaked signature in the output optical quadrature power spectral density of certain optomechanical systems.

EOS We use a human intelligence task to find out which facial features humans find to be the most important for identifying specific individuals. EOS We explore the differences between the saliency information gathered from humans and from ConvNets.	Humans develop biases in employing available information on facial features to discriminate across faces.
doc	Electrical resistivity of the Ti4O7 Magneli phase under high pressure EOS We have measured resistivity as a function of temperature and pressure of Ti4O7 twinned crystals using different contact configurations. EOS Pressures over 4kbar depress the localization of bipolarons and allow the study of the electrical conduction of the bipolaronic phase down to low temperatures. EOS For pressures P > 40 kbar the bipolaron formation transition is suppressed and a nearly pressure independent behavior is obtained for the resistivity. EOS We observed an anisotropic conduction. EOS When current is injected parallel to the principal axis, a metallic conduction with interacting carrier effects is predominant. EOS A superconducting state was not obtained down to 1.2 K, although evidences of the proximity of a quantum critical point were noticed. EOS While when current is injected non-parallel to the crystal's principal axis, we obtained a logarithmic divergence of the resistivity at low temperatures.	For this case, our results for the high pressure regime can be interpreted in the framework of interacting carriers (polarons or bipolarons) scattered by Two Level Systems.

doc	Interplay of synergy and redundancy in diamond motif EOS The formalism of partial information decomposition provides independent or non-overlapping components constituting total information content provided by a set of source variables about the target variable. EOS These components are recognised as unique information, synergistic information and, redundant information. EOS The metric of net synergy, conceived as the difference between synergistic and redundant information, is capable of detecting synergy, redundancy and, information independence among stochastic variables. EOS And it can be quantified, as it is done here, using appropriate combinations of different Shannon mutual information terms. EOS Utilisation of such a metric in network motifs with the nodes representing different biochemical species, involved in information sharing, uncovers rich store for interesting results.	In the current study, we make use of this formalism to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the relative information processing mechanism in a diamond motif and two of its sub-motifs namely bifurcation and integration motif embedded within the diamond motif.
doc	High-Throughput Atomic Force Microscopes Operating in Parallel EOS Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is an essential nanoinstrument technique for several applications such as cell biology and nanoelectronics metrology and inspection. EOS The need for statistically significant sample sizes means that data collection can be an extremely lengthy process in AFM. EOS The use of a single AFM instrument is known for its very low speed and not being suitable for scanning large areas, resulting in very-low-throughput measurement. EOS We address this challenge by parallelizing AFM instruments.	The parallelization is achieved by miniaturizing the AFM instrument and operating many of them simultaneously.

EOS We concentrate on the traces, that sharp features in the magnetic excitation spectrum imprint in the spectra of single-particle excitations. EOS The review gives in the first part an overview over the main corresponding experimental results obtained by inelastic neutron scattering, angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy, concentrating on the so-called magnetic resonance mode and the electronic self-energy effects that can be associated with it. EOS In the second part theoretical explanations for the observed effects are reviewed, with an emphasis on the interpretation of the magnetic resonance feature as spin-1 exciton below a gapped continuum, and on such effects in the single-particle electronic spectrum that can be assigned to the interaction with the spin-1 resonance feature.	The influence of the gapped spin-fluctuation continuum on the high-energy part of the electronic spectrum is discussed.
doc	Disorder Effects in d-wave Superconductors EOS In the theoretical analyses of impurity effects in superconductors the assumption is usually made that all quantities, except for the Green functions, are slowly varying functions of energy. EOS When this so-called Fermi Surface Restricted Approximation is combined with the assumption that impurities can be represented by delta-function potentials of arbitrary strength, many reasonable looking results can be obtained. EOS The agreement with experiments is not entirely satisfactory and one reason for this might be the assumption that the impurity potential has zero range. EOS The generalization to finite range potentials appears to be straightforward, independent of the strength of the potential.	However, the selfenergy resulting from scattering off finite range impurities of infinite strength such as hard spheres, diverges in this approximation at frequencies much larger than the gap amplitude!

EOS Both experimental and simulation data are growing explosively in plasma science and technology, motivating data-driven discoveries and inventions, which are currently in infancy. EOS Here we describe recent progress in microparticle cloud imaging and tracking (mCIT, _EQN_ CIT) for laboratory plasma experiments. EOS Three types of microparticle clouds are described: from exploding wires, in dusty plasmas and in atmospheric plasmas. EOS The experimental data sets are obtained with one or more imaging cameras at a rate up to 100k frames per second (fps). EOS A physics-constrained motion tracker, a Kohonen neural network (KNN) or self-organizing map (SOM), the feature tracking kit (FTK), and U-Net are described and compared with each other for particle tracking using the datasets.	Particle density and signal-to-noise ratio have been identified as two important factors that affect the tracking accuracy.
doc	Nonequilibrium Renormalization Group Fixed-Points of the Quantum _EQN_ -state Potts Chain EOS We derive an exact renormalization group recursion relation for the Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum _EQN_ -state Potts chain for all _EQN_. EOS The fixed-points of this recursion relation are found to be complex in general. EOS These fixed-points control the dynamical phases of the Potts chain, giving rise to non-analytic behaviors in its quantum dynamics.	The fixed-points for _EQN_ = 2, 3, 4, and 5 are discussed in detail.
doc	LTP: A New Active Learning Strategy for CRF-Based Named Entity Recognition EOS In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in many natural language processing tasks including named entity recognition. EOS The shortcoming is that a large amount of manually-annotated data is usually required. EOS Previous studies have demonstrated that active learning could elaborately reduce the cost of data annotation, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. EOS In real applications we found existing uncertainty-based active learning strategies have two shortcomings.	Firstly, these strategies prefer to choose long sequence explicitly or implicitly, which increase the annotation burden of annotators.
doc	Backflow and dissipation during the quantum decay of a metastable Fermi liquid EOS The particle current in a metastable Fermi liquid against a first-order phase transition is calculated at zero temperature.	During fluctuations of a droplet of the stable phase, in accordance with the conservation law, not only does an unperturbed current arise from the continuity at the boundary, but a backflow is induced by the density response.
doc	Intrinsic disorder in graphene on transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures EOS The electronic properties of two-dimensional materials such as graphene are extremely sensitive to their environment, especially the underlying substrate. EOS Planar van der Waals bonded substrates such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have been shown to greatly improve the electrical performance of graphene devices by reducing topographic variations and charge fluctuations compared to amorphous insulating substrates. EOS Semiconducting transition metal dichalchogenides (TMDs) are another family of van der Waals bonded materials that have recently received interest as alternative substrates to hBN for graphene as well as for components in novel graphene-based device heterostructures. EOS Additionally, their semiconducting nature permits dynamic gate voltage control over the interaction strength with graphene.	Through local scanning probe measurements we find that crystalline defects intrinsic to TMDs induce scattering in graphene which results in significant degradation of the heterostructure quality, particularly compared to similar graphene on hBN devices.
doc	Star-Formation Bimodality in Early-Type Galaxies EOS We compute the properties of a sample of 221 local early-type galaxies with a spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling software, CIGALEMC. EOS Concentrating on the star forming activity and dust contents, we derive parameters such as the specific star formation rate, the dust luminosity, dust mass and temperature. EOS 52 % of our sample is composed of elliptical (E) galaxies and 48 % of lenticular (S0) galaxies. EOS We find a larger proportion of S0 galaxies among galaxies with a large specific star formation rate (sSFR) and large specific dust emission. EOS The stronger activity of S0 galaxies is confirmed by larger dust masses. EOS We investigate the relative proportion of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming (SF) galaxies in our sample using spectroscopic SDSS data and near-infrared selection techniques, and find a larger proportion of AGN dominated galaxy in the S0 sample than the E one. EOS This could corroborate a scenario where blue galaxies evolve into red ellipticals by passing through a S0 AGN active period while quenching its star formation.	Finally, we find a good agreement comparing our estimates with color indicators.
doc	On Black-Box Transformations in Downward-Closed Environments EOS Black-box transformations have been extensively studied in algorithmic mechanism design as a generic tool for converting algorithms into truthful mechanisms without degrading the approximation guarantees. EOS While such transformations have been designed for a variety of settings, Chawla et al showed that no fully general black-box transformation exists for single-parameter environments. EOS In this paper, we investigate the potentials and limits of black-box transformations in the prior-free (i.e., non-Bayesian) setting in ph downward-closed single-parameter environments, a large and important class of environments in mechanism design.	On the positive side, we show that such a transformation can preserve a constant fraction of the welfare at every input if the private valuations of the agents take on a constant number of values that are far apart, while on the negative side, we show that this task is not possible for general private valuations.
doc	Anomalous behavior of membrane fluidity caused by copper-copper bond coupled phospholipids EOS Membrane fluidity, well-known to be essential for cell functions, is obviously affected by copper. EOS However, the underlying mechanism is still far from being understood, especially on the atomic level. EOS Here, we unexpectedly observed that a decrease in phospholipid (PL) bilayer fluidity caused by Cu2+ was much more significant than those induced by Zn2+ and Ca2+, while a comparable reduction occurred in the last two ions. EOS This finding clearly disagrees with the placement in the periodic table of Cu just next to Zn and far from Ca. EOS The physical nature was revealed to be a special attraction between Cu+ cations, which can induce a motif forming of two phospholipids coupled by Cu-Cu bond (PL-diCu-PL). EOS Namely, upon Cu2+ ion binding to a negatively charged phosphate group of lipid, Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+.	The special attraction of the cations then caused one Cu+ ion simultaneously binding to two lipids and another Cu+, resulting in the formation of PL-diCu-PL structure.

doc	Subgraph Frequencies: Mapping the Empirical and Extremal Geography of Large Graph Collections EOS A growing set of on-line applications are generating data that can be viewed as very large collections of small, dense social graphs -- these range from sets of social groups, events, or collaboration projects to the vast collection of graph neighborhoods in large social networks. EOS A natural question is how to usefully define a domain-independent coordinate system for such a collection of graphs, so that the set of possible structures can be compactly represented and understood within a common space. EOS In this work, we draw on the theory of graph homomorphisms to formulate and analyze such a representation, based on computing the frequencies of small induced subgraphs within each graph. EOS We find that the space of subgraph frequencies is governed both by its combinatorial properties, based on extremal results that constrain all graphs, as well as by its empirical properties, manifested in the way that real social graphs appear to lie near a simple one-dimensional curve through this space. EOS We develop flexible frameworks for studying each of these aspects. EOS For capturing empirical properties, we characterize a simple stochastic generative model, a single-parameter extension of Erdos-Renyi random graphs, whose stationary distribution over subgraphs closely tracks the concentration of the real social graph families. EOS For the extremal properties, we develop a tractable linear program for bounding the feasible space of subgraph frequencies by harnessing a toolkit of known extremal graph theory.	Together, these two complementary frameworks shed light on a fundamental question pertaining to social graphs: what properties of social graphs are 'social' properties and what properties are 'graph' properties?
doc	The direct cooling tail method for X-ray burst analysis to constrain neutron star masses and radii EOS Determining neutron star (NS) radii and masses can help to understand the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities. EOS Thermal emission during thermonuclear X-ray bursts from NSs in low-mass X-ray binaries provides a unique opportunity to study NS parameters, because of the high fluxes, large luminosity variations and the related changes in the spectral properties. EOS The standard cooling tail method uses hot NS atmosphere models to convert the observed spectral evolution during cooling stages of X-ray bursts to the Eddington flux F_Edd and the stellar angular size \Omega. EOS These are then translated to the constraints on the NS mass M and radius R. EOS Here we present the improved, direct cooling tail method that generalises the standard approach.	First, we adjust the cooling tail method to account for the bolometric correction to the flux.
doc	A Model of the Cellular Iron Homeostasis Network Using Semi-Formal Methods for Parameter Space Exploration EOS This paper presents a novel framework for the modeling of biological networks. EOS It makes use of recent tools analyzing the robust satisfaction of properties of (hybrid) dynamical systems. EOS The main challenge of this approach as applied to biological systems is to get access to the relevant parameter sets despite gaps in the available knowledge. EOS An initial estimate of useful parameters was sought by formalizing the known behavior of the biological network in the STL logic using the tool Breach. EOS Then, once a set of parameter values consistent with known biological properties was found, we tried to locally expand it into the largest possible valid region. EOS We applied this methodology in an effort to model and better understand the complex network regulating iron homeostasis in mammalian cells.	This system plays an important role in many biological functions, including erythropoiesis, resistance against infections, and proliferation of cancer cells.

doc	Broadband Spectra and Variability of BL Lacertae in 2000 EOS We have organized an extensive multiwavelength campaign on BL Lacertae in the second half of 2000. EOS Simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous observations were taken at radio frequencies, in the optical - carried out by the WEBT collaboration -, in X-rays - using BeppoSAX and RXTE -, and at VHE gamma-rays with the CAT and HEGRA Cherenkov telescope facilities. EOS In this paper, we are presenting first results from this campaign. EOS The WEBT optical campaign achieved an unprecedented time coverage, virtually continuous over several 10 - 20 hour segments, and revealed intraday variability on time scales of ~ 1.5 hours. EOS The X-ray observations of Nov.	1 - 2, 2000, revealed significant variability on similar time scales, and provided evidence for the synchrotron spectrum extending out to ~ 10 keV during that time.
doc	Stochastic Model Based Proxy Servers Architecture for VoD to Achieve Reduced Client Waiting Time EOS In a video on demand system, the main video repository may be far away from the user and generally has limited streaming capacities. EOS Since a high quality video's size is huge, it requires high bandwidth for streaming over the internet. EOS In order to achieve a higher video hit ratio, reduced client waiting time, distributed server's architecture can be used, in which multiple local servers are placed close to clients and, based on their regional demands video contents are cached dynamically from the main server. EOS As the cost of proxy server is decreasing and demand for reduced waiting time is increasing day by day, newer architectures are explored, innovative schemes are arrived at. EOS In this paper we present novel 3 layer architecture, includes main multimedia server, a Tracker and Proxy servers. EOS This architecture targets to optimize the client waiting time. EOS We also propose an efficient prefix caching and load sharing algorithm at the proxy server to allocate the cache according to regional popularity of the video.	The simulation results demonstrate that it achieves significantly lower client's waiting time, when compared to the other existing algorithms.

A relative energy distribution test is done comparing events inside oversampled spherical caps of equal exposure, to those outside, using the Poisson likelihood ratio.
doc	Holstein model in infinite dimensions at half-filling EOS The normal state of the Holstein model is studied at half-filling in infinite dimensions and in the adiabatic regime. EOS The dynamical mean-field equations are solved using perturbation expansions around the extremal paths of the effective action for the atoms.	We find that the Migdal-Eliashberg expansion breaks down in the metallic state if the electron-phonon coupling _EQN_ exceeds a value of about 1.3 in spite of the fact that the formal expansion parameter _EQN_ (_EQN_ is the phonon frequency, _EQN_ the Fermi energy) is much smaller than 1.
doc	First-order differential equations for a particle with spin _EQN_ EOS A system of first-order differential equations for a particle with nonzero mass and spin _EQN_ is constructed.

The six-component wave function yields the positive-definite probability density _EQN_.
doc	Proton Form Factor Ratio, _EQN_ from Double Spin Asymmetry EOS The ratio of the electric and magnetic form factor of the proton, _EQN_, has been measured for elastic electron-proton scattering with polarized beam and target up to four-momentum transfer squared, _EQN_ (GeV/c) _EQN_ using the double spin asymmetry for target spin orientation aligned nearly perpendicular to the beam momentum direction. EOS This measurement of _EQN_ agrees with the _EQN_ dependence of previous recoil polarization data and reconfirms the discrepancy at high _EQN_ between the Rosenbluth and the polarization-transfer method with a different measurement technique and systematic uncertainties uncorrelated to those of the recoil-polarization measurements.	The form factor ratio at _EQN_ =2.06 (GeV/c) _EQN_ has been measured as _EQN_, which is in agreement with an earlier measurement with the polarized target technique at similar kinematics.

doc	The effect of helium accretion efficiency on rates of Type Ia supernovae: double-detonations in accreting binaries EOS The double-detonation explosion scenario of Type Ia supernovae has gained increased support from the SN Ia community as a viable progenitor model, making it a promising candidate alongside the well-known single degenerate and double degenerate scenarios. EOS We present delay times of double-detonation SNe, in which a sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes non-dynamically from a helium-rich companion. EOS One of the main uncertainties in quantifying SN rates from double-detonations is the (assumed) retention efficiency of He-rich matter. EOS Therefore, we implement a new prescription for the treatment of accretion/accumulation of He-rich matter on white dwarfs. EOS In addition, we test how the results change depending on which criteria are assumed to lead to a detonation in the helium shell. EOS In comparing the results to our standard case (Ruiter et al 2011), we find that regardless of the adopted He accretion prescription, the SN rates are reduced by only 25% if low-mass He shells (< 0.05 Msun) are sufficient to trigger the detonations.	If more massive (0.1 Msun) shells are needed, the rates decrease by 85% and the delay time distribution is significantly changed in the new accretion model - only SNe with prompt (< 500 Myr) delay times are produced.
doc	Distinguishing the roles of energy funnelling and delocalization in photosynthetic light harvesting EOS Photosynthetic complexes improve the transfer of excitation energy from peripheral antennas to reaction centers in several ways. EOS In particular, a downward energy funnel can direct excitons in the right direction, while coherent excitonic delocalization can enhance transfer rates through the cooperative phenomenon of supertransfer.	However, isolating the role of purely coherent effects is difficult because any change to the delocalization also changes the energy landscape.
doc	Scale Effects on the Ballistic Penetration of Graphene Sheets EOS Carbon nanostructures are promising ballistic protection materials, due to their low density and excellent mechanical properties.

doc	CT-GAN: Malicious Tampering of 3D Medical Imagery using Deep Learning EOS In 2018, clinics and hospitals were hit with numerous attacks leading to significant data breaches and interruptions in medical services. EOS An attacker with access to medical records can do much more than hold the data for ransom or sell it on the black market. EOS In this paper, we show how an attacker can use deep-learning to add or remove evidence of medical conditions from volumetric (3D) medical scans. EOS An attacker may perform this act in order to stop a political candidate, sabotage research, commit insurance fraud, perform an act of terrorism, or even commit murder.	We implement the attack using a 3D conditional GAN and show how the framework (CT-GAN) can be automated.

doc	Fast, scalable, and interactive software for Landau-de Gennes numerical modeling of nematic topological defects EOS Numerical modeling of nematic liquid crystals using the tensorial Landau-de Gennes (LdG) theory provides detailed insights into the structure and energetics of the enormous variety of possible topological defect configurations that may arise when the liquid crystal is in contact with colloidal inclusions or structured boundaries. EOS However, these methods can be computationally expensive, making it challenging to predict (meta)stable configurations involving several colloidal particles, and they are often restricted to system sizes well below the experimental scale. EOS Here we present an open-source software package that exploits the embarrassingly parallel structure of the lattice discretization of the LdG approach. EOS Our implementation, combining CUDA/C++ and OpenMPI, allows users to accelerate simulations using both CPU and GPU resources in either single- or multiple-core configurations. EOS We make use of an efficient minimization algorithm, the Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine (FIRE) method, that is well-suited to large-scale parallelization, requiring little additional memory or computational cost while offering performance competitive with other commonly used methods.	In multi-core operation we are able to scale simulations up to supra-micron length scales of experimental relevance, and in single-core operation the simulation package includes a user-friendly GUI environment for rapid prototyping of interfacial features and the multifarious defect states they can promote.
doc	On Multipath Fading Channels at High SNR EOS This work studies the capacity of multipath fading channels. EOS A noncoherent channel model is considered, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver is cognizant of the realization of the path gains, but both are cognizant of their statistics. EOS It is shown that if the delay spread is large in the sense that the variances of the path gains decay exponentially or slower, then capacity is bounded in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). EOS For such channels, capacity does not tend to infinity as the SNR tends to infinity. EOS In contrast, if the variances of the path gains decay faster than exponentially, then capacity is unbounded in the SNR.	It is further demonstrated that if the number of paths is finite, then at high SNR capacity grows double-logarithmically with the SNR, and the capacity pre-loglog, defined as the limiting ratio of capacity to log(log(SNR)) as SNR tends to infinity, is 1 irrespective of the number of paths.

EOS Specifically, we use all strong emission lines in the MUSE wavelength range 4650-9300 \AA\ to investigate the resolved ionized gas properties on _EQN_ 100 pc scales. EOS This spatial resolution enables us to disentangle HII regions from the Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) in the computation of gas metallicities and Star Formation Rates (SFRs) of star forming regions.	The gas metallicities generally decrease with radius.

EOS The search strategy focused on articles applying ML to high-grade glioma biomarkers for treatment response monitoring, prognosis, and prediction.	Results: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically used throughout the patient pathway because routine structural imaging provides detailed anatomical and pathological information and advanced techniques provide additional physiological detail.
doc	Data Augmentation of Spectral Data for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Based Deep Chemometrics EOS Deep learning methods are used on spectroscopic data to predict drug content in tablets from near infrared (NIR) spectra. EOS Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), features are ex- tracted from the spectroscopic data. EOS Extended multiplicative scatter correction (EMSC) and a novel spectral data augmentation method are benchmarked as preprocessing steps. EOS The learned models perform better or on par with hypothetical optimal partial least squares (PLS) models for all combinations of preprocessing. EOS Data augmentation with subsequent EMSC in combination gave the best results. EOS The deep learning model CNNs also outperform the PLS models in an extrapolation chal- lenge created using data from a second instrument and from an analyte concentration not covered by the training data.	Qualitative investigations of the CNNs kernel activations show their resemblance to wellknown data processing methods such as smoothing, slope/derivative, thresholds and spectral region selection.

doc	Broadcasting on Random Directed Acyclic Graphs EOS We study a generalization of the well-known model of broadcasting on trees. EOS Consider a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with a unique source vertex _EQN_, and suppose all other vertices have indegree _EQN_. EOS Let the vertices at distance _EQN_ from _EQN_ be called layer _EQN_. EOS At layer _EQN_, _EQN_ is given a random bit. EOS At layer _EQN_, each vertex receives _EQN_ bits from its parents in layer _EQN_, which are transmitted along independent binary symmetric channel edges, and combines them using a _EQN_ -ary Boolean processing function. EOS The goal is to reconstruct _EQN_ with probability of error bounded away from _EQN_ using the values of all vertices at an arbitrarily deep layer. EOS This question is closely related to models of reliable computation and storage, and information flow in biological networks. EOS In this paper, we analyze randomly constructed DAGs, for which we show that broadcasting is only possible if the noise level is below a certain degree and function dependent critical threshold. EOS For _EQN_, and random DAGs with layer sizes _EQN_ and majority processing functions, we identify the critical threshold. EOS For _EQN_, we establish a similar result for NAND processing functions. EOS We also prove a partial converse for odd _EQN_ illustrating that the identified thresholds are impossible to improve by selecting different processing functions if the decoder is restricted to using a single vertex. EOS Finally, for any noise level, we construct explicit DAGs (using expander graphs) with bounded degree and layer sizes _EQN_ admitting reconstruction. EOS In particular, we show that such DAGs can be generated in deterministic quasi-polynomial time or randomized polylogarithmic time in the depth.	These results portray a doubly-exponential advantage for storing a bit in DAGs compared to trees, where _EQN_ but layer sizes must grow exponentially with depth in order to enable broadcasting.

doc	Constraints in the BV formalism: six-dimensional supersymmetry and its twists EOS We formulate the abelian six-dimensional _EQN_ theory perturbatively, in a generalization of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. EOS Using this description, we compute the holomorphic and non-minimal twists at the perturbative level. EOS This calculation hinges on the existence of an _EQN_ action of the supersymmetry algebra on the abelian tensor multiplet, which we describe in detail. EOS Our formulation appears naturally in the pure spinor superfield formalism, but understanding it requires developing a presymplectic generalization of the BV formalism, inspired by Dirac's theory of constraints. EOS The holomorphic twist consists of symplectic-valued holomorphic bosons from the _EQN_ hypermultiplet, together with a degenerate holomorphic theory of holomorphic coclosed one-forms from the _EQN_ tensor multiplet, which can be interpreted as representing the intermediate Jacobian. EOS We check that our formulation and our results match with known ones under various dimensional reductions, as well as comparing the holomorphic twist to Kodaira-Spencer theory.	Matching our formalism to five-dimensional Yang-Mills theory after reduction leads to some issues related to electric-magnetic duality;
doc	Coherence of burst oscillations and accretion-powered pulsations in the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338 EOS X-ray timing of the accretion-powered pulsations during the 2003 outburst of the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338 has revealed variation in the pulse time of arrival residuals. EOS These can be interpreted in several ways, including spin-down and wandering of the fuel impact point around the magnetic pole. EOS In this Letter we show that the burst oscillations of this source are coherent with the persistent pulsations, to the level where they track all of the observed fluctuations. EOS Only one burst, which occurs at the lowest accretion rates, shows a significant phase offset. EOS We discuss what might lead to such rigid phase-locking between the modulations in the accretion and thermonuclear burst emission, and consider the implications for spin variation and the burst oscillation mechanism.	Wandering of the fuel impact hot spot around a fixed magnetic pole seems the most likely cause for the accretion-powered pulse phase variations.
doc	Dynamics of the spin-half Heisenberg chain at intermediate temperatures EOS Combining high-temperature expansions with the recursion method and quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the maximum entropy method, we study the dynamics of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain at temperatures above and below the coupling J. EOS By comparing the two sets of calculations, their relative strengths are assessed. EOS At high temperatures, we find that there is a low-frequency peak in the momentum integrated dynamic structure factor, due to diffusive long-wavelength modes. EOS This peak is rapidly suppressed as the temperature is lowered below J. EOS Calculation of the complete dynamic structure factor S(k,w) shows how the spectral features associated with the two-spinon continuum develop at low temperatures.	We extract the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 from the w-->0 limit, and compare with recent experimental results for Sr2CuO3 and CuGeO3.
doc	Markov Brains: A Technical Introduction EOS Markov Brains are a class of evolvable artificial neural networks (ANN). EOS They differ from conventional ANNs in many aspects, but the key difference is that instead of a layered architecture, with each node performing the same function, Markov Brains are networks built from individual computational components. EOS These computational components interact with each other, receive inputs from sensors, and control motor outputs.	The function of the computational components, their connections to each other, as well as connections to sensors and motors are all subject to evolutionary optimization.

Motivated by recent experiments, we find the leading non-adiabatic corrections to the results, known for the adiabatic limit.

doc	Pattern Matching and Classification of Clusters in Collision Cascades EOS The structure of defect clusters formed in a displacement cascade plays a significant role in the micro-structural evolution during irradiation. EOS Molecular dynamics simulations have been widely used to study collision cascades and subsequent clustering of defects. EOS We present a novel method to pattern match and classify defect clusters.	A cluster is characterized by the geometrical and topological histograms of its angles and distances which can then be used as similarity metrics.
doc	On the Bound States in a Non-linear Quantum Field Theory of a Spinor Field with Higher Derivatives EOS We consider a model of quantum field theory with higher derivatives for a spinor field with quartic selfinteraction.

doc	Multi-speaker Emotion Conversion via Latent Variable Regularization and a Chained Encoder-Decoder-Predictor Network EOS We propose a novel method for emotion conversion in speech based on a chained encoder-decoder-predictor neural network architecture. EOS The encoder constructs a latent embedding of the fundamental frequency (F0) contour and the spectrum, which we regularize using the Large Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) registration framework. EOS The decoder uses this embedding to predict the modified F0 contour in a target emotional class. EOS Finally, the predictor uses the original spectrum and the modified F0 contour to generate a corresponding target spectrum.	Our joint objective function simultaneously optimizes the parameters of three model blocks.
doc	Stirring N-body systems II: Necessary conditions for the dark matter attractor EOS We study the evolution of the phase-space of collisionless N-body systems under repeated stirrings or perturbations, which has been shown to lead to a convergence towards a limited group of end states. EOS This so-called attractor was previously shown to be independent of the initial system and environmental conditions. EOS However the fundamental reason for its appearance is still unclear. EOS It has been suggested that the origin of the attractor may be either radial infall (RI), the radial orbit instability (ROI), or energy exchange which, for instance, happens during violent relaxation. EOS Here we examine the effects of a set of controlled perturbations, referred to as `kicks', which act in addition to the standard collisionless dynamics by allowing pre-specified instantaneous perturbations in phase-space.	We first demonstrate that the attractor persists in the absence of RI and ROI by forcing the system to expand.

doc	Resolving accretion flows in nearby active galactic nuclei with the Event Horizon Telescope EOS The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), now with its first ever image of the photon ring around the supermassive black hole of M87, provides a unique opportunity to probe the physics of supermassive black holes through Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), such as the existence of the event horizon, the accretion processes as well as jet formation in Low Luminosity AGN (LLAGN).	We build a theoretical model which includes an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) with emission from thermal and non-thermal electrons in the flow and a simple radio jet outflow.

doc	Probabilistic state transfer, estimation and measures for optimal actuator/sensor placement for linear systems with packet dropouts EOS We consider linear systems subject to packet dropouts and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for an arbitrary state transfer and state estimation over a finite time instance _EQN_. EOS The data loss signal is modeled using the Bernoulli random variable. EOS We leverage properties of the Hadamard product in our approach and use the derived necessary and sufficient conditions to compute the probability that an arbitrary state transfer is possible at a specified time instant. EOS Similarly, the probability of finding an exact state estimate is found using the observability counterparts of the results.	Using the necessary and sufficient conditions obtained for the invertibility of the Gramian, we give new probabilistic measures for optimal actuator and sensor placement problems and obtain optimal/sub-optimal solutions.
doc	Fixed-Point Adiabatic Quantum Search EOS Fixed-point quantum search algorithms succeed at finding one of _EQN_ target items among _EQN_ total items even when the run time of the algorithm is longer than necessary. EOS While the famous Grover's algorithm can search quadratically faster than a classical computer, it lacks the fixed-point property --- the fraction of target items must be known precisely to know when to terminate the algorithm. EOS Recently, Yoder, Low, and Chuang gave an optimal gate-model search algorithm with the fixed-point property. EOS Meanwhile, it is known that an adiabatic quantum algorithm, operating by continuously varying a Hamiltonian, can reproduce the quadratic speedup of gate-model Grover search. EOS We ask, can an adiabatic algorithm also reproduce the fixed-point property? EOS We show that the answer depends on what interpolation schedule is used, so as in the gate model, there are both fixed-point and non-fixed-point versions of adiabatic search, only some of which attain the quadratic quantum speedup. EOS Guided by geometric intuition on the Bloch sphere, we rigorously justify our claims with an explicit upper bound on the error in the adiabatic approximation. EOS We also show that the fixed-point adiabatic search algorithm can be simulated in the gate model with neither loss of the quadratic Grover speedup nor of the fixed-point property.	Finally, we discuss natural uses of fixed-point algorithms such as preparation of a relatively prime state and oblivious amplitude amplification.
doc	Cointegration and unit root tests: A fully Bayesian approach EOS To perform statistical inference for time series, one should be able to assess if they present deterministic or stochastic trends. EOS For univariate analysis one way to detect stochastic trends is to test if the series has unit roots, and for multivariate studies it is often relevant to search for stationary linear relationships between the series, or if they cointegrate.	The main goal of this article is to briefly review the shortcomings of unit root and cointegration tests proposed by the Bayesian approach of statistical inference and to show how they can be overcome by the fully Bayesian significance test (FBST), a procedure designed to test sharp or precise hypothesis.
doc	The Discovery of a Strong Magnetic Field and Co-rotating Magnetosphere in the Helium-weak Star HD 176582 EOS We report the detection of a strong, reversing magnetic field and variable H-alpha emission in the bright helium-weak star HD 176582 (HR 7185). EOS Spectrum, magnetic and photometric variability of the star are all consistent with a precisely determined period of 1.5819840 +/- 0.0000030 days which we assume to be the rotation period of the star. EOS From the magnetic field curve, and assuming a simple dipolar field geometry, we derive a polar field strength of approximately 7 kG and a lower limit of 52 degrees for the inclination of the rotation axis. EOS However, based on the behaviour of the H-alpha emission we adopt a large inclination angle of 85 degrees and this leads to a large magnetic obliquity of 77 degrees. EOS The H-alpha emission arises from two distinct regions located at the intersections of the magnetic and rotation equators and which corotate with the star at a distance of about 3.5 R* above its surface. EOS We estimate that the emitting regions have radial and meridional sizes on the order of 2 R* and azimuthal extents (perpendicular to the magnetic equator) of less than approximately 0.6 R*.	HD 176582 therefore appears to show many of the cool magnetospheric phenomena as that displayed by other magnetic helium-weak and helium-strong stars such as the prototypical helium-strong star sigma Ori E.
doc	Detection of He II 4686 in eta Carinae EOS We report the detection of the emission line He II 4686 A in eta Carinae. EOS The equivalent width of this line is ~100 mA along most of the 5.5-yr cycle and jumps to ~900 mA just before phase 1.0, followed by a brief disappearance.	The similarity between the intensity variations of this line and of the X-ray light curve is remarkable, suggesting that they are physically connected.
doc	Direct estimation of global longitudinal strain from echocardiograms using a logarithm-scaled Fourier magnitude correlation EOS We present a new algorithm, the logarithmic-transform correlation (LTC) method, for measuring global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global longitudinal strain rate (GLSr) from 2D echocardiograms. EOS In contrast to conventional GLS computation methods, our approach does not require boundary segmentation and regularization. EOS The algorithm was benchmarked against conventional GLS methods using synthetic left ventricle (LV) ultrasound images generated to represent five different ischemia conditions each on five different ultrasound imaging systems.	LV GLS and GLSr measurement error was assessed as a function of contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratio using mean absolute error (MAE) and root-mean-square error (RMSE).
doc	Quark motional effects on the interquark potential in baryons EOS We study the heavy-heavy-light quark (_EQN_) system in a non-relativistic potential model, and investigate the quark motional effect on the inter-two-quark potential in baryons. EOS We adopt the Hamiltonian with the static three-quark potential which is obtained by the first-principle calculation of lattice QCD, rather than the two-body force in ordinary quark models.	Using the renormalization-group inspired variational method in discretized space, we calculate the ground-state energy of _EQN_ systems and the light-quark spatial distribution.
doc	How Much Does It Hurt: A Deep Learning Framework for Chronic Pain Score Assessment EOS Chronic pain is defined as pain that lasts or recurs for more than 3 to 6 months, often long after the injury or illness that initially caused the pain has healed.	The "gold standard" for chronic pain assessment remains self report and clinical assessment via a biopsychosocial interview, since there has been no device that can measure it.
doc	You say Normalizing Flows I see Bayesian Networks EOS Normalizing flows have emerged as an important family of deep neural networks for modelling complex probability distributions. EOS In this note, we revisit their coupling and autoregressive transformation layers as probabilistic graphical models and show that they reduce to Bayesian networks with a pre-defined topology and a learnable density at each node. EOS From this new perspective, we provide three results. EOS First, we show that stacking multiple transformations in a normalizing flow relaxes independence assumptions and entangles the model distribution. EOS Second, we show that a fundamental leap of capacity emerges when the depth of affine flows exceeds 3 transformation layers.	Third, we prove the non-universality of the affine normalizing flow, regardless of its depth.
doc	Behavior of Fermi Systems Approaching Fermion Condensation Quantum Phase Transition from Disordered Phase EOS The behavior of Fermi systems which approach the fermion condensation quantum phase transition (FCQPT) from the disordered phase is considered. EOS We show that the quasiparticle effective mass _EQN_ diverges as _EQN_ where _EQN_ is the system density and _EQN_ is the critical point at which FCQPT occurs.	Such a behavior is of general form and takes place in both three dimensional (3D) systems and two dimensional (2D) ones.

EOS A smooth _EQN_ is isotropic if _EQN_ are linearly independent and the span of _EQN_ is isotropic. EOS Given an isotropic curve, we show that there is a unique up to translation parameter such that _EQN_ (we call such parameter the isotropic parameter) and there also exists a natural moving frame.	In this paper, we consider two sequences of curve flows on the space of isotropic curves parametrized by isotropic parameter.

doc	A supercritical series analysis for the generalized contact process with diffusion EOS We study a model that generalizes the CP with diffusion. EOS An additional transition is included in the model so that at a particular point of its phase diagram a crossover from the directed percolation to the compact directed percolation class will happen. EOS We are particularly interested in the effect of diffusion on the properties of the crossover between the universality classes.	To address this point, we develop a supercritical series expansion for the ultimate survival probability and analyse this series using d-log Pad\'e and partial differential approximants.
doc	Global critical temperature in inhomogeneous superconductors induced by multifractality EOS There is growing evidence, from experiments and numerical simulations, that a key feature of sufficiently disordered superconductors is the spatial inhomogeneity of the order parameter. EOS However not much is known analytically about the details of its spatial distribution or the associated global critical temperature that signals the breaking of long-range order. EOS Here we address this problem for disordered systems around an Anderson transition characterized by multifractal one-body eigenstates. EOS In the limit of weak multifractality and for weakly coupled superconductors we compute the superconducting order parameter analytically, including its energy dependence and statistical distribution in space. EOS The spatial distribution of the order parameter is found to be always log-normal. EOS The global critical temperature, computed by percolation techniques and neglecting phase fluctuations, is enhanced with respect to the clean limit only for very weakly coupled superconductors. EOS Some enhancement still persists even in the presence of moderate phase fluctuations crudely modelled by increasing the percolation threshold.	Our results are also consistent with experiments, where enhancement of the critical temperature is observed in Al thin films, a very weakly coupled metallic superconductor, but not in more strongly coupled materials.
doc	An unified theory of quantised electrons, phonons and photons out-of-equilibrium: a simplified ab-initio approach based on the Generalised Baym-Kadanoff ansatz EOS We present a full ab-inito description of the coupled out-of-equilibrium dynamics of photons, phonons, and electrons. EOS In the present approach the quantised nature of the electromagnetic field as well as of the nuclear oscillations is fully taken into account. EOS The result is a set of integro-differential equations, written on the Keldysh contour, for the Green's functions of electrons, phonons, and photons where the different kind of interactions are merged together. EOS We then concentrate on the electronic dynamics in order to reduce the problem to a computationally feasible approach. EOS By using the Generalised Baym-Kadanoff ansatz and the Completed Collision approximation we introduce a series of efficient but controllable approximations.	In this way we reduce all equations to a set of decoupled equations for the density matrix that describe all kind of static and dynamical correlations.

doc	Handwriting styles: benchmarks and evaluation metrics EOS Evaluating the style of handwriting generation is a challenging problem, since it is not well defined. EOS It is a key component in order to develop in developing systems with more personalized experiences with humans. EOS In this paper, we propose baseline benchmarks, in order to set anchors to estimate the relative quality of different handwriting style methods. EOS This will be done using deep learning techniques, which have shown remarkable results in different machine learning tasks, learning classification, regression, and most relevant to our work, generating temporal sequences. EOS We discuss the challenges associated with evaluating our methods, which is related to evaluation of generative models in general.	We then propose evaluation metrics, which we find relevant to this problem, and we discuss how we evaluate the evaluation metrics.

doc	Optimising the Input Image to Improve Visual Relationship Detection EOS Visual Relationship Detection is defined as, given an image composed of a subject and an object, the correct relation is predicted. EOS To improve the visual part of this difficult problem, ten preprocessing methods were tested to determine whether the widely used Union method yields the optimal results.	Therefore, focusing solely on predicate prediction, no object detection and linguistic knowledge were used to prevent them from affecting the comparison results.
doc	Self-supervised Auxiliary Learning with Meta-paths for Heterogeneous Graphs EOS Graph neural networks have shown superior performance in a wide range of applications providing a powerful representation of graph-structured data. EOS Recent works show that the representation can be further improved by auxiliary tasks. EOS However, the auxiliary tasks for heterogeneous graphs, which contain rich semantic information with various types of nodes and edges, have less explored in the literature.	In this paper, to learn graph neural networks on heterogeneous graphs we propose a novel self-supervised auxiliary learning method using meta-paths, which are composite relations of multiple edge types.
doc	How well do we know the electromagnetic form factors of the proton? EOS Several experiments have extracted proton electromagnetic form factors from elastic cross section measurements using the Rosenbluth technique. EOS Global analyses of these measurements indicate approximate scaling of the electric and magnetic form factors (mu_p*G_E/G_M = 1), in contrast to recent polarization transfer measurements from Jefferson Lab. EOS We present here a global reanalysis of the cross section data aimed at understanding the disagreement between the Rosenbluth extraction and the polarization transfer data.	We find that the individual cross section measurements are self-consistent, and that the new global analysis yields results that are still inconsistent with polarization measurements.
doc	More on Parametrization Relevant to Describe Violation of CP, T and CPT Symmetries in the _EQN_ System EOS To study violation of CP, T and/or CPT symmetries in the _EQN_ systems, one has to parametrize the relevant mixing parameters and decay amplitudes in such a way that each parameter represents violation of these symmetries in a well-defined way. EOS Parametrization is of course not unique and is always subject to phase ambiguities.	We discuss these problems with freedom associated with rephasing of final (or intermediate) as well as initial states taken into account.
doc	Probing Dark Matter freeze-in with long-lived particle signatures: MATHUSLA, HL-LHC and FCC-hh EOS Collider searches for long-lived particles yield a promising avenue to probe the freeze-in production of Dark Matter via the decay of a parent particle.

EOS Let _EQN_ be a closed connected orientable 4-manifold with torsion free _EQN_, where _EQN_. EOS Our main result is a complete readily calculable classification of embeddings _EQN_, up to the equivalence relation generated by isotopy and embedded connected sum with embeddings _EQN_.	Such a classification was already known only for _EQN_ by the work of Bo\'echat, Haefliger and Hudson from 1970.
doc	Chemical enrichment and star formation in the Milky Way disk III. Chemodynamical constraints EOS In this paper, we investigate some chemokinematical properties of the Milky Way disk, by using a sample composed by 424 late-type dwarfs. EOS We show that the velocity dispersion of a stellar group correlates with the age of this group, according to a law proportional to t^0.26, where t is the age of the stellar group. EOS The temporal evolution of the vertex deviation is considered in detail. EOS It is shown that the vertex deviation does not seem to depend strongly on the age of the stellar group. EOS Previous studies in the literature seem to not have found it due to the use of statistical ages for stellar groups, rather than individual ages.	The possibility to use the orbital parameters of a star to derive information about its birthplace is investigated, and we show that the mean galactocentric radius is likely to be the most reliable stellar birthplace indicator.
doc	Coupled Control Systems: Periodic Orbit Generation with Application to Quadrupedal Locomotion EOS A robotic system can be viewed as a collection of lower-dimensional systems that are coupled via reaction forces (Lagrange multipliers) enforcing holonomic constraints.	Inspired by this viewpoint, this paper presents a novel formulation for nonlinear control systems that are subject to coupling constraints via virtual "coupling" inputs that abstractly play the role of Lagrange multipliers.
doc	Freely precessing neutron stars: Model and observations EOS We present a model of a freely precessing neutron star which is then compared against pulsar observations. EOS The aim is to draw conclusions regarding the structure of the star, and test theoretical ideas of crust-core coupling and superfluidity. EOS We argue that, on theoretical grounds, it is likely that the core neutron superfluid does not participate in the free precession of the crust. EOS We apply our model to the handful of proposed observations of free precession that have appeared in the literature. EOS Assuming crust-only precession, we find that all but one of the observations are consistent with there not being any pinned crustal superfluid at all; EOS the maximum amount of pinned superfluid consistent with the observations is about 10^-10 of the total stellar moment of inertia. EOS However, the observations do not rule out the possibility that the crust and neutron superfluid core precess as a single unit. EOS In this case the maximum amount of pinned superfluid consistent with the observations is about 10^-8 of the total stellar moment of inertia.	Both of these values are many orders of magnitude less than the 10^-2 value predicted by many theories of pulsar glitches.

doc	A sequentially Markov conditional sampling distribution for structured populations with migration and recombination EOS Conditional sampling distributions (CSDs), sometimes referred to as copying models, underlie numerous practical tools in population genomic analyses. EOS Though an important application that has received much attention is the inference of population structure, the explicit exchange of migrants at specified rates has not hitherto been incorporated into the CSD in a principled framework. EOS Recently, in the case of a single panmictic population, a sequentially Markov CSD has been developed as an accurate, efficient approximation to a principled CSD derived from the diffusion process dual to the coalescent with recombination. EOS In this paper, the sequentially Markov CSD framework is extended to incorporate subdivided population structure, thus providing an efficiently computable CSD that admits a genealogical interpretation related to the structured coalescent with migration and recombination.	As a concrete application, it is demonstrated empirically that the CSD developed here can be employed to yield accurate estimation of a wide range of migration rates.
doc	Neutrino generated dynamical dark energy with no dark energy field EOS Dynamical dark energy (DE) phenomenon emerges as a geometrical effect accompanying the cosmological expansion of nonrelativistic fermionic matter. EOS This occurs without the need for any fluid, like e.g. EOS dynamical scalar field (quintessence, cosmon, etc.), and with conventional form of the Einstein equations in contrast to other known geometrical DE models. EOS The phenomenon results from first principles in the framework of the two measures field theory where, in the Einstein frame, both fermion masses and the cosmological constant (CC) turn into functions of the cold fermion density n. EOS This n dependence becomes negligible in regular (laboratory) conditions but it may have an important role in cosmology. EOS In the 4D gravity model where the original action involves only CC and massive fermions without selfinteraction, for different (but wide) regions in the parameter space we have found two possible classes of scenarios for the late universe starting from the cold matter domination era. EOS We argue that the fermions which drive the variable CC should be associated with cold neutrinos disposed in voids and supervoids.	The cosmological dynamics of the first class practically coincides with that of the LambdaCDM model, while the dynamics of the second class is of the phantom-like regime with a pseudo-rip scenario.
doc	Real applications of quantum imaging EOS In the last years the possibility of creating and manipulating quantum states of light has paved the way to the development of new technologies exploiting peculiar properties of quantum states, as quantum information, quantum metrology & sensing, quantum imaging... EOS In particular Quantum Imaging addresses the possibility of overcoming limits of classical optics by using quantum resources as entanglement or sub-poissonian statistics. EOS Albeit quantum imaging is a more recent field than other quantum technologies, e.g. EOS quantum information, it is now substantially mature for application.	Several different protocols have been proposed, some of them only theoretically, others with an experimental implementation and a few of them pointing to a clear application.
doc	Higher pentagram maps, weighted directed networks, and cluster dynamics EOS The pentagram map that associates to a projective polygon a new one formed by intersections of short diagonals was introduced by R. EOS Schwartz and was shown to be integrable by V. EOS Ovsienko, R. EOS Schwartz and S. EOS Tabachnikov. EOS Recently, M. EOS Glick demonstrated that the pentagram map can be put into the framework of the theory of cluster algebras. EOS In this paper, we extend and generalize Glick's work by including the pentagram map into a family of discrete completely integrable systems. EOS Our main tool is Poisson geometry of weighted directed networks on surfaces developed by M. EOS Gekhtman, M. EOS Shapiro, and A. EOS Vainshtein. EOS The ingredients necessary for complete integrability -- invariant Poisson brackets, integrals of motion in involution, Lax representation -- are recovered from combinatorics of the networks.	Our integrable systems depend on one discrete parameter _EQN_.
doc	Identification and estimation of treatment and interference effects in observational studies on networks EOS Causal inference on a population of units connected through a network often presents technical challenges, including how to account for interference. EOS In the presence of local interference, for instance, potential outcomes of a unit depend on its treatment as well as on the treatments of other local units, such as its neighbors according to the network. EOS In observational studies, a further complication is that the typical unconfoundedness assumption must be extended - say, to include the treatment of neighbors, and indi- vidual and neighborhood covariates - to guarantee identification and valid inference.	Here, we propose new estimands that define treatment and interference effects.

EOS We compare topographic and optical signals and investigate the fluctuations of the position-dependent TERS spectra.	TERS mapping provides information about the chemical composition and conformation of aptamers, and paves the way to future single-molecule label-free sequencing.

doc	Substrate Integrated Bragg Waveguide: an Octave-bandwidth Single-mode Functional Transmission-Line for Millimeter-Wave and Terahertz Applications EOS We demonstrate an air-core single-mode hollow waveguide that uses Bragg reflector structures in place of the vertical metal walls of the standard rectangular waveguide or via holes of the so-called substrate integrated waveguide. EOS The high-order modes in the waveguide are substantially suppressed by a modal-filtering effect, making the waveguide operate in the fundamental mode over more than one octave. EOS Numerical simulations show that the propagation loss of the proposed waveguide can be lower than that of classic hollow metallic rectangular waveguides at terahertz frequencies, benefiting from a significant reduction in Ohmic loss. EOS To facilitate fabrication and characterization, a proof-of-concept 20 to 45 GHz waveguide is demonstrated, which verifies the properties and advantages of the proposed waveguide.	A zero group-velocity dispersion point is observed at near the middle of the operating band.
doc	On the Validity of the Conjugate Pairing Rule for Lyapunov Exponents EOS For Hamiltonian systems subject to an external potential, which in the presence of a thermostat will reach a nonequilibrium stationary state, Dettmann and Morriss proved a strong conjugate pairing rule (SCPR) for pairs of Lyapunov exponents in the case of isokinetic (IK) stationary states which have a given kinetic energy. EOS This SCPR holds for all initial phases of the system, all times t and all numbers of particles N. EOS This proof was generalized by Wojtkovski and Liverani to include hard interparticle potentials. EOS A geometrical reformulation of those results is presented. EOS The present paper proves numerically, using periodic orbits for the Lorentz gas, that SCPR cannot hold for isoenergetic (IE) stationary states, which have a given total internal energy.	In that case strong evidence is obtained for CPR to hold for large N and t, where it can be conjectured that the larger N, the smaller t will be.
doc	Time Fused Coefficient SIR Model with Application to COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States EOS In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Removal (SIR) model with time fused coefficients. EOS In particular, our proposed model discovers the underlying time homogeneity pattern for the SIR model's transmission rate and removal rate via Bayesian shrinkage priors. EOS The properties of the proposed models are examined and a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is used to sample from the posterior distribution. EOS Computation is facilitated by the nimble package in R, which provides a fast computation of our proposed method. EOS Extensive simulation studies are carried out to examine the empirical performance of the proposed methods.	We further apply the proposed methodology to analyze different levels of COVID-19 data in the United States.

EOS For muonic _EQN_ and _EQN_ decays, the data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 37.1 _EQN_ 1.3 pb _EQN_. EOS Here the _EQN_ and _EQN_ bosons are reconstructed from muons with transverse momenta, _EQN_, above 20 GeV and pseudorapidity, _EQN_, between 2 and 4.5, and, in the case of the _EQN_, a dimuon invariant mass _EQN_ between 60 GeV and 120 GeV. EOS For _EQN_ decays to tau lepton final states, 247 pb _EQN_ of data has been used.

doc	Chemical abundance gradients from open clusters in the Milky Way disk: results from the APOGEE survey EOS Metallicity gradients provide strong constraints for understanding the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. EOS We report on radial abundance gradients of Fe, Ni, Ca, Si, and Mg obtained from a sample of 304 red-giant members of 29 disk open clusters, mostly concentrated at galactocentric distances between ~8 - 15 kpc, but including two open clusters in the outer disk. EOS The observations are from the APOGEE survey. EOS The chemical abundances were derived automatically by the ASPCAP pipeline and these are part of the SDSS III Data Release 12. EOS The gradients, obtained from least squares fits to the data, are relatively flat, with slopes ranging from -0.026 to -0.033 dex/kpc for the alpha-elements [O/H], [Ca/H], [Si/H] and [Mg/H] and -0.035 dex/kpc and -0.040 dex/kpc for [Fe/H] and [Ni/H], respectively.	Our results are not at odds with the possibility that metallicity ([Fe/H]) gradients are steeper in the inner disk (R_GC ~7 - 12 kpc) and flatter towards the outer disk.
doc	The Unruh Effect in General Boundary Quantum Field Theory EOS In the framework of the general boundary formulation (GBF) of scalar quantum field theory we obtain a coincidence of expectation values of local observables in the Minkowski vacuum and in a particular state in Rindler space. EOS This coincidence could be seen as a consequence of the identification of the Minkowski vacuum as a thermal state in Rindler space usually associated with the Unruh effect. EOS However, we underline the difficulty in making this identification in the GBF.	Beside the Feynman quantization prescription for observables that we use to derive the coincidence of expectation values, we investigate an alternative quantization prescription called Berezin-Toeplitz quantization prescription, and we find that the coincidence of expectation values does not exist for the latter.

EOS The wealth process is subject to shocks produced by a general marked point process. EOS The problem of the agent is to derive the optimal insurance strategy which allows "lowering" the level of the shocks. EOS This optimization problem is related to a suitable dual stochastic control problem in which the delicate boundary constraints disappear. EOS In Mnif REF, the dual value function is characterized as the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton Jacobi Bellman Variational Inequality (HJBVI in short).	We characterize the optimal insurance strategy by the solution of the variational inequality which we solve numerically by using an algorithm based on policy iterations.
doc	Anomaly constraint on massless QCD and the role of Skyrmions in chiral symmetry breaking EOS We discuss consequences of the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with massless fundamental quarks. EOS We derive the new discrete 't Hooft anomaly of massless QCD for generic numbers of color _EQN_ and flavor _EQN_, and an exotic chiral-symmetry broken phase without quark-bilinear condensate is ruled out from possible QCD vacua. EOS We show that the _EQN_ baryon number symmetry is anomalously broken when the _EQN_ discrete axial symmetry and the flavor symmetry are gauged. EOS In the ordinary chiral symmetry breaking, the Skyrmion current turns out to reproduce this 't Hooft anomaly of massless QCD. EOS In the exotic chiral symmetry breaking, however, the anomalous breaking of _EQN_ does not take the correct form, and it is inconsistent with anomaly matching.	This no-go theorem is based only on symmetries and anomalies, and thus has a wider range of applicability to the QCD phase diagram than the previous one obtained by QCD inequalities.
doc	Extracting Information-rich Part of Texts using Text Denoising EOS The aim of this paper is to report on a novel text reduction technique, called Text Denoising, that highlights information-rich content when processing a large volume of text data, especially from the biomedical domain. EOS The core feature of the technique, the text readability index, embodies the hypothesis that complex text is more information-rich than the rest.	When applied on tasks like biomedical relation bearing text extraction, keyphrase indexing and extracting sentences describing protein interactions, it is evident that the reduced set of text produced by text denoising is more information-rich than the rest.
doc	Simulated interaction of MHD shock waves with a complex network-like region EOS We provide estimates of the wave energy reaching the solar chromosphere and corona in a network-like magnetic field topology, including a coronal null point.	The waves are excited by an instantaneous strong subphotospheric source and propagate through the subphotosphere, photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and corona with the plasma beta and other atmospheric parameters varying by several orders of magnitude.
doc	The m=2 amplituhedron EOS The (tree) amplituhedron _EQN_ is introduced by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka in 2013 in the study of _EQN_ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.

EOS Our collection of cells is constructed via BCFW-type recursion.	We also provide a diagrammatic interpretation of our construction.

doc	Platform Independent Software Analysis for Near Memory Computing EOS Near-memory Computing (NMC) promises improved performance for the applications that can exploit the features of emerging memory technologies such as 3D-stacked memory. EOS However, it is not trivial to find such applications and specialized tools are needed to identify them. EOS In this paper, we present PISA-NMC, which extends a state-of-the-art hardware agnostic profiling tool with metrics concerning memory and parallelism, which are relevant for NMC. EOS The metrics include memory entropy, spatial locality, data-level, and basic-block-level parallelism.	By profiling a set of representative applications and correlating the metrics with the application's performance on a simulated NMC system, we verify the importance of those metrics.
doc	Test Flavor SU(3) symmetry in Exclusive _EQN_ decays EOS Flavor SU(3) symmetry is a powerful tool to analyze charmed baryon decays, however its applicability remains to be experimentally validated. EOS Since there is not much data on _EQN_ decays, various exclusive _EQN_ decays especially the ones into a neutron state are essential for the test of flavor symmetry.	These decay modes are also helpful to investigate final state interactions in charmed baryon decays.
doc	Modeling and Experimental Verification of Adaptive 100% Stator Ground Fault Protection Schemes for Synchronous Generators EOS Salient pole synchronous generators as the main component of an electricity generation station should be carefully maintained and their operation has to be monitored such that any damage on them is avoided. EOS Otherwise, the generating station might experience frequent shut downs which results in electricity generation interruptions and high costs associated with repairing and compensation of lack of energy. EOS In this sense, many protective schemes focusing on a variety of synchronous generator faults have already been proposed and are still modified and developed to further enhance the quality of protection. EOS In this thesis, synchronous generator stator windings to ground fault is studied as one of the most common and crucial faults in these machines. EOS Numerous methods of stator winding to ground fault protection schemes are also reported in the literature. EOS Third harmonic differential voltage and sub-harmonic schemes are studied in this research. EOS A novel adaptive scheme for both methods is modelled and implemented in a comprehensive lab scale set-up where a real generation unit is scaled down including all different components and apparatus. EOS The simulation model is also established based on simultaneous finite element analysis (FEA) and coupled magnetic circuit to assist with system configuration design and parameter selections. EOS The adaptive scheme is proved to be capable of detecting stator windings to ground faults based on actual experimental data. EOS Finally, the proposed adaptive scheme is compared against other available non-adaptive protection schemes currently used in industrial relays. EOS Several important performance evaluation criteria in protection schemes such as sensitivity and security of operation referred to as reliability are considered.	It is shown that the adaptive scheme offers higher reliability than other schemes which emphasizes its credibility and applicability.
doc	Laplacian regularized low rank subspace clustering EOS The problem of fitting a union of subspaces to a collection of data points drawn from multiple subspaces is considered in this paper. EOS In the traditional low rank representation model, the dictionary used to represent the data points is chosen as the data points themselves and thus the dictionary is corrupted with noise. EOS This problem is solved in the low rank subspace clustering model which decomposes the corrupted data matrix as the sum of a clean and self-expressive dictionary plus a matrix of noise and gross errors. EOS Also, the clustering results of the low rank representation model can be enhanced by using a graph of data similarity. EOS This model is called Laplacian regularized low rank representation model with a graph regularization term added to the objective function. EOS Inspired from the above two ideas, in this paper a Laplacian regularized low rank subspace clustering model is proposed.	This model uses a clean dictionary to represent the data points and a graph regularization term is also incorporated in the objective function.
doc	The credibility of Rydberg atom based digital communication over a continuously tunable radio-frequency carrier EOS High-sensitive measurement of radio-frequency (RF) electric field is available via the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect of Rydberg atom at room-temperature, which has been developed to be a promising atomic RF receiver. EOS In this Letter, we investigate the credibility of the digital communication via this quantum-based antenna over the entire continuously tunable RF-carrier.	Our experiment shows that digital communication at a rate of 500 kbps performs reliably within a tunable bandwidth of 200 MHz at carrier 10.22 GHz and a bit error rate (BER) appears out of this range, for example, the BER runs up to 15 % at RF-detuning _EQN_ MHz.
doc	Spatial Separation of the 3.29 micron Emission Feature and Associated 2 micron Continuum in NGC 7023 EOS We present a new 0.9" resolution 3.29 micron narrowband image of the reflection nebula NGC 7023. EOS We find that the 3.29 micron IEF in NGC 7023 is brightest in narrow filaments NW of the illuminating star. EOS These filaments have been seen in images of K', molecular hydrogen emission lines, the 6.2 and 11.3 micron IEFs, and HCO+. EOS We also detect 3.29 micron emission faintly but distinctly between the filaments and the star.	The 3.29 micron image is in contrast to narrowband images at 2.09, 2.14, and 2.18 micron, which show an extended emission peak midway between the filaments and the star, and much fainter emission near the filaments.
doc	Changes in the morphology of interstellar ice analogues after hydrogen atom exposure EOS The morphology of water ice in the interstellar medium is still an open question. EOS Although accretion of gaseous water could not be the only possible origin of the observed icy mantles covering dust grains in cold molecular clouds, it is well known that water accreted from the gas phase on surfaces kept at 10 K forms ice films that exhibit a very high porosity. EOS It is also known that in the dark clouds H2 formation occurs on the icy surface of dust grains and that part of the energy (4.48 eV) released when adsorbed atoms react to form H2 is deposited in the ice. EOS The experimental study described in the present work focuses on how relevant changes of the ice morphology result from atomic hydrogen exposure and subsequent recombination. EOS Using the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique and a method of inversion analysis of TPD spectra, we show that there is an exponential decrease in the porosity of the amorphous water ice sample following D-atom irradiation. EOS This decrease is inversely proportional to the thickness of the ice and has a value of Phi_0 = 2 x 10^16 D-atoms/cm^2 per layer of H2O.	We also use a model which confirms that the binding sites on the porous ice are destroyed regardless of their energy depth, and that the reduction of the porosity corresponds in fact to a reduction of the effective area.
doc	Achromatic orbital angular momentum generator EOS We describe a novel approach for generating light beams that carry orbital angular momentum (OAM) by means of total internal reflection in an isotropic medium. EOS A continuous space-varying cylindrically symmetric reflector, in the form of \textit two glued hollow axicons, is used to introduce a nonuniform rotation of polarisation into a linearly polarised input beam. EOS This device acts as a full spin-to-orbital angular momentum convertor.	It functions by switching the helicity of the incoming beam's polarisation, and by conservation of total angular momentum thereby generates a well-defined value of OAM.

doc	The Mirage of Action-Dependent Baselines in Reinforcement Learning EOS Policy gradient methods are a widely used class of model-free reinforcement learning algorithms where a state-dependent baseline is used to reduce gradient estimator variance. EOS Several recent papers extend the baseline to depend on both the state and action and suggest that this significantly reduces variance and improves sample efficiency without introducing bias into the gradient estimates. EOS To better understand this development, we decompose the variance of the policy gradient estimator and numerically show that learned state-action-dependent baselines do not in fact reduce variance over a state-dependent baseline in commonly tested benchmark domains.	We confirm this unexpected result by reviewing the open-source code accompanying these prior papers, and show that subtle implementation decisions cause deviations from the methods presented in the papers and explain the source of the previously observed empirical gains.
doc	Statistical prefactor and nucleation rate near and out of the critical point EOS The nucleation rate derived in the classical theory contains at least one undetermined parameter, which may be expressed in terms of the Langer first-principles theory. EOS But the uncertainties in the accounting for fluctuation modes, which are either absorbed into the free energy of a critical cluster or not, result in different evaluations of the statistical prefactor and nucleation rate. EOS We get the scaling approximations of the nucleation rate for the vapour condensation both near and out of the critical range. EOS The results obtained deserve the experimental verification to resolve the theoretical uncertainty.	PACS numbers: 64.60.Qb, 05.70.Fh, 64.60.Fr, 64.70.Fx
doc	Entanglement entropy for the n-sphere EOS We calculate the entanglement entropy for a sphere and a massless scalar field in any dimensions. EOS The reduced density matrix is expressed in terms of the infinitesimal generator of conformal transformations keeping the sphere fixed. EOS The problem is mapped to the one of a thermal gas in a hyperbolic space and solved by the heat kernel approach. EOS The coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entropy for 2 and 4 spacetime dimensions are in accordance with previous numerical and analytical results.	In particular, the four dimensional result, together with the one reported by Solodukhin, gives support to the Ryu-Takayanagi holographic anzats.
doc	RHEOS.jl-A Julia Package for Rheology Data Analysis EOS Rheology is the science of deformation and flow, with a focus on materials that do not exhibit simple linear elastic or viscous Newtonian behaviours. EOS Rheology plays an important role in the empirical characterisation of soft viscoelastic materials commonly found in the food and cosmetics industry, as well as in biology and bioengineering. EOS A broad range of theoretical tools exist to extract material parameters and interpret them thanks to data analysis and/or physical modelling. EOS RHEOS (RHEology, Open-Source) is a software package designed to make the analysis of rheological data simpler, faster and more reproducible. EOS RHEOS is currently limited to the broad family of linear viscoelastic models. EOS A particular strength of the library is its ability to handle rheological models containing fractional derivatives which have demonstrable utility for the modelling of biological materials but have hitherto remained in relative obscurity-possibly due to their mathematical and computational complexity. EOS RHEOS is written in Julia, which greatly assists achievement of our aims as it provides excellent computational efficiency and approachable syntax. EOS RHEOS is fully documented and has extensive testing coverage.	It should be noted that RHEOS is not an optimisation package.
doc	On the paradox of pesticides EOS The paradox of pesticides was observed experimentally, which says that pesticides may dramatically increase the population of a pest when the pest has a natural predator. EOS Here we use a mathematical model to study the paradox. EOS We find that the timing for the application of pesticides is crucial for the resurgence or non-resurgence of the pests. EOS In particular, regularly applying pesticides is not a good idea as also observed in experiments.	In fact, the best time to apply pesticides is when the pest population is reasonably high.
doc	Adaptive Low-Nonnegative-Rank Approximation for State Aggregation of Markov Chains EOS This paper develops a low-nonnegative-rank approximation method to identify the state aggregation structure of a finite-state Markov chain under an assumption that the state space can be mapped into a handful of meta-states. EOS The number of meta-states is characterized by the nonnegative rank of the Markov transition matrix. EOS Motivated by the success of the nuclear norm relaxation in low rank minimization problems, we propose an atomic regularizer as a convex surrogate for the nonnegative rank and formulate a convex optimization problem. EOS Because the atomic regularizer itself is not computationally tractable, we instead solve a sequence of problems involving a nonnegative factorization of the Markov transition matrices by using the proximal alternating linearized minimization method. EOS Two methods for adjusting the rank of factorization are developed so that local minima are escaped. EOS One is to append an additional column to the factorized matrices, which can be interpreted as an approximation of a negative subgradient step. EOS The other is to reduce redundant dimensions by means of linear combinations. EOS Overall, the proposed algorithm very likely converges to the global solution.	The efficiency and statistical properties of our approach are illustrated on synthetic data.
doc	Magnetic field gradients in solar wind plasma and geophysics periods EOS Using recent data obtained by Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) the pumping scale of the magnetic field gradients of the solar wind plasma has been calculated. EOS This pumping scale is found to be equal to 24h _EQN_ 2h. EOS The ACE spacecraft orbits at the L1 libration point which is a point of Earth-Sun gravitational equilibrium about 1.5 million km from Earth.	Since the Earth's magnetosphere extends into the vacuum of space from approximately 80 to 60,000 kilometers on the side toward the Sun the pumping scale cannot be a consequence of the 24h-period of the Earth's rotation.
doc	On permutations derived from integer powers _EQN_ EOS We present a general theorem characterizing the relationship between the prime base _EQN_ representations of non-negative integers _EQN_ and their positive integer powers, _EQN_. EOS For any positive integer _EQN_, the theorem establishes the existence of bijective mappings (permutations) between all _EQN_ members _EQN_ of each non-zero residue class mod _EQN_ satisfying _EQN_. EOS These mappings are obtained as the integer part of _EQN_ for a particular positive integer _EQN_, depending on _EQN_ and _EQN_, called the "coding shift", for which an explicit formula is given.	For relatively prime _EQN_ and _EQN_, _EQN_ and the result follows directly from properties of the multiplicative group of invertible elements modulo _EQN_.

Riemannian and Lorentzian surfaces with one Killing vector field are discussed in detail, and their global structure is described using conformal block method.
doc	An Overview of Emergent Order in Far-from-equilibrium Driven Systems: From Kuramoto Oscillators to Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection EOS Soft-matter systems when driven out-of-equilibrium often give rise to structures that usually lie in-between the macroscopic scale of the material and microscopic scale of its constituents. EOS In this paper we review three such systems, the two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model, the Kuramoto model and the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection system which when driven out-of-equilibrium give rise to emergent spatio-temporal order through self-organization. EOS A common feature of these systems is that the entities that self-organize are coupled to one another in some way, either through local interactions or through a continuous media.	Therefore, the general nature of non-equilibrium fluctuations of the intrinsic variables in these systems are found to follow similar trends as order emerges.
doc	Relativistic quantum dynamics of scalar bosons under a full vector Coulomb interaction EOS The relativistic quantum dynamics of scalar bosons in the background of a full vector coupling (minimal plus nonminimal vector couplings) is explored in the context of the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau formalism. EOS The Coulomb phase shift is determined for a general mixing of couplings and it is shown that the space component of the nonminimal coupling is a sine qua non condition for the exact closed-form scattering amplitude. EOS It follows that the Rutherford cross section vanishes in the absence of the time component of the minimal coupling.	Bound-state solutions obtained from the poles of the partial scattering amplitude show that the time component of the minimal coupling plays an essential role.

doc	Extended Hamiltonian Formalism of the Pure Space-Like Axial Gauge Schwinger Model II EOS Canonical methods are not sufficient to properly quantize space-like axial gauges. EOS In this paper, we obtain guiding principles which allow the construction of an extended Hamiltonian formalism for pure space-like axial gauge fields. EOS To do so, we clarify the general role residual gauge fields play in the space-like axial gauge Schwinger model. EOS In all the calculations we fix the gauge using a rule, _EQN_, where _EQN_ is a space-like constant vector and we refer to its direction as _EQN_. EOS Then, to begin with, we construct a formulation in which the quantization surface is space-like but not parallel to the direction of _EQN_.	The quantization surface has a parameter which allows us to rotate it, but when we do so we keep the direction of the gauge field fixed.

doc	Gamma-Gamma Absorption in the Broad Line Region Radiation Fields of Gamma-Ray Blazars EOS The expected level of gamma-gamma absorption in the Broad Line Region (BLR) radiation field of gamma-ray loud Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs)is evaluated as a function of the location of the gamma-ray emission region. EOS This is done self-consistently with parameters inferred from the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED) in a single-zone leptonic EC-BLR model scenario. EOS We take into account all geometrical effects both in the calculation of the gamma-gamma opacity and the normalization of the BLR radiation energy density. EOS As specific examples, we study the FSRQs 3C279 and PKS 1510-089, keeping the BLR radiation energy density at the location of the emission region fixed at the values inferred from the SED.	We confirm previous findings that the optical depth due to _EQN_ absorption in the BLR radiation field exceeds unity for both 3C279 and PKS 1510-089 for locations of the gamma-ray emission region inside the inner boundary of the BLR.
doc	Invariance principle for biased Boostrap Random Walk EOS Our main goal is to study a class of processes whose increments are generated via a cellular automata rule. EOS Given the increments of a simple biased random walk, a new sequence of (dependent) Bernoulli random variables is produced. EOS It is built, from the original sequence, according to a cellular automata rule. EOS Equipped with these two sequences, we construct two more according to the same cellular automata rule. EOS The construction is repeated a fixed number of times yielding an infinite array (_EQN_) of (dependent) Bernoulli random variables. EOS %In turn, using this new sequence as input, we reiterate a construction of a new sequence. EOS %This process is repeated a finite number of times resulting in an infinite array, herein called the "downward process", of highly dependent Bernoulli random variables. EOS The process of taking partial products can be reversed allowing to construct new sequences, herein called the "upward process", the characteristics of which are different from the downward process.	Taking partial sums of these sequences, we obtain a _EQN_ -dimensional process whose increments belong to the state space _EQN_.
doc	Non-hermitian Exact Local Bosonic Algorithm for Dynamical Quarks EOS We present an exact version of the local bosonic algorithm for the simulation of dynamical quarks in lattice QCD.

EOS Two variants of this test are presented. EOS For both of them, a formal proof is given that this Monte Carlo algorithm converges to the right distribution.	Simulation data are presented for different lattice parameters.

We investigate inclusion relations, distortion theorem, extreme points, convex combination and other interesting properties for these families of harmonic functions.
doc	Completion and deficiency problems EOS Given a partial Steiner triple system (STS) of order _EQN_, what is the order of the smallest complete STS it can be embedded into? EOS The study of this question goes back more than 40 years. EOS In this paper we answer it for relatively sparse STSs, showing that given a partial STS of order _EQN_ with at most _EQN_ triples, it can always be embedded into a complete STS of order _EQN_, which is asymptotically optimal. EOS We also obtain similar results for completions of Latin squares and other designs. EOS This suggests a new, natural class of questions, called deficiency problems. EOS Given a global spanning property _EQN_ and a graph _EQN_, we define the deficiency of the graph _EQN_ with respect to the property _EQN_ to be the smallest positive integer _EQN_ such that the join _EQN_ has property _EQN_.	To illustrate this concept we consider deficiency versions of some well-studied properties, such as having a _EQN_ -decomposition, Hamiltonicity, having a triangle-factor and having a perfect matching in hypergraphs.

doc	Generalization of exactly-solvable model to exhibit solid-fluid phase transition in crystal structures with two particles in a primitive cell EOS In our previous paper [H. EOS K., J.Stat.Mech.(2015) P08020], we investigated an interacting-particle model with infinite-range cosine potentials, and derived the partition function which shows solid-fluid phase transition by exact calculation. EOS However, we could treat only simple lattice structures in which more than one stable point exist in a primitive cell such as the triangular or face-centered cubic lattice. EOS In the present paper, we generalize our previous scheme to more complicated lattice structures with two particles in a primitive cell.	Generalization to more complicated lattice structures is straightforward.

doc	Four heads are better than three EOS We construct recursively-presented finitely-generated torsion groups which have bounded torsion and whose word problem is conjunctive equivalent (in particular positive and Turing equivalent) to a given recursively enumerable set. EOS These groups can be interpreted as groups of finite state machines or as subgroups of topological full groups, on effective subshifts over other torsion groups. EOS We define a recursion-theoretic property of a set of natural numbers, called impredictability, which roughly states that a Turing machine can enumerate numbers such that every Turing machine occasionally "correctly guesses" whether they are in the language (by halting on them or not), even if trying not to, and given an oracle for shorter identities. EOS We prove that impredictable recursively enumerable sets exist.	Combining these constructions and slightly adapting a result of [Salo and T\"orm\"a, 2017], we obtain that four-headed group-walking finite-state automata can define strictly more subshifts than three-headed automata on a group containing a copy of the integers, confirming a conjecture of [Salo and T\"orm\"a, 2017].

EOS Different forms for the scale factor and several examples of fluids will be considered. EOS We also analyze the relation between bounce and finite-time singularities and between the corresponding fluids realizing this scenarios.	In the last part of the work, the study is extended to the framework of _EQN_ -modified gravity, where the modification of gravity may also be considered as an effective (viscous) fluid producing the bounce.

We also obtain the dynamical solution for the Hopf loop around a black hole and for the general toroidal spiral in Minkowski background.

EOS Our model is built upon the Migdal-Eliashberg theory for the electron self-energy within the phonon-coupling scenario.	Following this perturbative approach, a numerical evaluation of the bare band dispersion energy in terms of the electron-phonon coupling parameter _EQN_ allows a unified description of the nodal-kink effect.

doc	Relativistic _EQN_ in the calculation of relics abundances: a closer look EOS In this paper we clarify the relation between the invariant relativistic relative velocity _EQN_, the M\o ller velocity _EQN_, and the non-relativistic relative velocity _EQN_. EOS Adopting _EQN_ as the true physical relative velocity for pair-collisions in a non-degenerate relativistic gas, we show that in the frame co-moving with the gas (i) the thermally averaged cross section times relative velocity _EQN_ that appears in the density evolution equation for thermal relics is reformulated only in terms of _EQN_ and _EQN_ in a manifestly Lorentz invariant form;	(ii) the frame-dependent issues of the standard formulation in terms of the M\o ller velocity, as well as "superluminal" relative velocities, are not present in this formulation.
doc	Measuring contextual citation impact of scientific journals EOS This paper explores a new indicator of journal citation impact, denoted as source normalized impact per paper (SNIP). EOS It measures a journal's contextual citation impact, taking into account characteristics of its properly defined subject field, especially the frequency at which authors cite other papers in their reference lists, the rapidity of maturing of citation impact, and the extent to which a database used for the assessment covers the field's literature. EOS It further develops Eugene Garfield's notions of a field's 'citation potential' defined as the average length of references lists in a field and determining the probability of being cited, and the need in fair performance assessments to correct for differences between subject fields. EOS A journal's subject field is defined as the set of papers citing that journal. EOS SNIP is defined as the ratio of the journal's citation count per paper and the citation potential in its subject field. EOS It aims to allow direct comparison of sources in different subject fields.	Citation potential is shown to vary not only between journal subject categories - groupings of journals sharing a research field - or disciplines (e.g., journals in mathematics, engineering and social sciences tend to have lower values than titles in life sciences), but also between journals within the same subject category.
doc	Demonstrating high-precision photometry with a CubeSat: ASTERIA observations of 55 Cancri e EOS ASTERIA (Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research In Astrophysics) is a 6U CubeSat space telescope (10 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm, 10 kg). EOS ASTERIA's primary mission objective was demonstrating two key technologies for reducing systematic noise in photometric observations: high-precision pointing control and high-stabilty thermal control.	ASTERIA demonstrated 0.5 arcsecond RMS pointing stability and _EQN_ 10 milliKelvin thermal control of its camera payload during its primary mission, a significant improvement in pointing and thermal performance compared to other spacecraft in ASTERIA's size and mass class.

EOS This system is related to coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations with critical exponents for nonlinear optics and Bose-Einstein condensates. EOS We prove a sharp result on the removability of the same isolated singularity for both two components of the solutions.	We also prove the nonexistence of positive solutions with one component bounded near the singularity and the other component unbounded near the singularity.

doc	The Interstellar Medium White Paper EOS The interstellar medium is the engine room for galactic evolution. EOS While much is known about the conditions within the ISM, many important areas regarding the formation and evolution of the various phases of the ISM leading to star formation, and its role in important astrophysical processes, remain to be explained. EOS This paper discusses several of the fundamental science problems, placing them in context with current activities and capabilities, as well as the future capabilities that are needed to progress them in the decade ahead. EOS Australia has a vibrant research community working on the interstellar medium. EOS This discussion gives particular emphasis to Australian involvement in furthering their work, as part of the wider international endeavour.	The particular science programs that are outlined in this White Paper include the formation of molecular clouds, the ISM of the Galactic nucleus, the origin of gamma-rays and cosmic rays, high mass star and cluster formation, the dense molecular medium, galaxy evolution and the diffuse atomic medium, supernova remnants, the role of magnetism and turbulence in the Galactic ecology and complex organic molecules in space.

doc	Enhancement of superconductivity by external magnetic field in magnetic alloys EOS An asymptotic solution of the thermodynamics of a BCS superconductor containing spin 1/2 and 7/2 magnetic impurities, obtained recently in Ref. EOS 1 is exploited to derive the expressions for critical magnetic field _EQN_. EOS The credibility of the resulting theoretical equations, which depend on the magnetic coupling constant _EQN_ and impurity concentration _EQN_, is verified on the experimental data for the following superconducting alloys: LaCe, ThGd and SmRh _EQN_ B _EQN_. EOS Good quantitative agreement with experimental data is found for sufficiently small values of _EQN_. EOS The discrepancies between theoretical and experimental values of _EQN_ for larger values of _EQN_ in case of LaCe and ThGd are reduced by introducing the concept of the effective temperature _EQN_, which accounts for the Coulomb interactions between the electron gas and impurity ions. EOS At low temperatures, the critical magnetic field is found to increase with decreasing temperature _EQN_. EOS This enhancement of the critical magnetic field provides evidence of the Jaccarino-Peter effect, which was experimentally observed in the Kondo systems like LaCe, (La _EQN_ Ce _EQN_)Al _EQN_ and also in the pseudoternary compounds, including Sn _EQN_ Eu _EQN_ Mo _EQN_ S _EQN_, Pb _EQN_ Eu _EQN_ Mo _EQN_ S _EQN_ and La _EQN_ Eu _EQN_ Mo _EQN_ S _EQN_. EOS The effect of an external magnetic field _EQN_ on a BCS superconductor perturbed by magnetic impurities was also studied.	On this grounds, by analyzing the dependence of superconducting transition temperature _EQN_ on _EQN_ of (La _EQN_ Ce _EQN_)Al _EQN_, we have shown, that for certain parameter values, external magnetic field compensates the destructive effect of magnetic impurities.
doc	Fusion of finite set distributions: Pointwise consistency and global cardinality EOS A recent trend in distributed multi-sensor fusion is to use random finite set filters at the sensor nodes and fuse the filtered distributions algorithmically using their exponential mixture densities (EMDs). EOS Fusion algorithms which extend the celebrated covariance intersection and consensus based approaches are such examples. EOS In this article, we analyse the variational principle underlying EMDs and show that the EMDs of finite set distributions do not necessarily lead to consistent fusion of cardinality distributions. EOS Indeed, we demonstrate that these inconsistencies may occur with overwhelming probability in practice, through examples with Bernoulli, Poisson and independent identically distributed (IID) cluster processes. EOS We prove that pointwise consistency of EMDs does not imply consistency in global cardinality and vice versa.	Then, we redefine the variational problems underlying fusion and provide iterative solutions thereby establishing a framework that guarantees cardinality consistent fusion.
doc	A Quantum Mechanical Bound for Space-Energy Cost with Respect to the Von Neumann Entropy EOS This thesis discusses the possibility of uncertainty relations for space and energy given a state of fixed entropy. EOS In particular, it discusses the results in the paper of Dam/Nguyen. EOS There, the authors propose a lower bound for the mixed cost in energy and space required for physically storing information in a quantum mechanical system.	We first critically examine the justifications for the bound given in the paper.This is done from a mathematical point of view, in contrast to the more physically motivated original paper.Then we give two examples that illustrate the limitations of this inequality.
doc	Stochastic models of gene transcription with upstream drives: exact solution and sample path characterization EOS Gene transcription is a highly stochastic and dynamic process. EOS As a result, the mRNA copy number of a given gene is heterogeneous both between cells and across time. EOS We present a framework to model gene transcription in populations of cells with time-varying (stochastic or deterministic) transcription and degradation rates.	Such rates can be understood as upstream cellular drives representing the effect of different aspects of the cellular environment.
doc	Comparison of current models for Hot Jupiters to the sample of transiting exoplanets EOS A growing number (over 100! EOS) of extra-solar planets (ESPs) have been discovered by transit photometry, and these systems are important because the transit strongly constrains their orbital inclination and allows accurate physical parameters for the planet to be derived, especially their radii. EOS Their mass-radius relation allows us to probe their internal structure. EOS In the present work we calculate Safronov numbers for the current sample of ESP and compare their masses and radii to current models with the goal of obtaining better constrains on their formation processe. EOS Our calculation of Safronov numbers for the current TESP sample does show 2 classes, although about 20% lie above the formal Class I definition. EOS These trends and recent results that argue against a useful distinction between Safronov classes are under further investigation. EOS Mass-radius relations for the current sample of TESP are inconsistent with ESP models with very large core masses (\geq 100 M\oplus). EOS Most TESP with radii near 1RJ are consistent with models with no core mass or core masses of 10 M\oplus.	The inflated planets, with radii \geq 1.2 RJ are not consistent with current ESP models, but may lie along the lower end of models for brown dwarfs.

doc	GMRT mini-survey to search for 21-cm absorption in Quasar-Galaxy Pairs at z~0.1 EOS We present the results from our 21-cm absorption survey of a sample of 5 quasar-galaxy pairs (QGPs), with the redshift of the galaxies in the range 0.03<zg<0.18, selected from the SDSS. EOS The HI 21-cm absorption was searched towards the 9 sight lines with impact parameters ranging from 10 to 55 kpc using GMRT. EOS 21-cm absorption was detected only in one case i.e. EOS towards the Quasar (zq=2.625 SDSS J124157.54+633241.6)-galaxy (zg=0.143 SDSS J124157.26+633237.6) pair with the impact parameter 11 kpc. EOS The quasar sight line in this case pierces through the stellar disk of a galaxy having near solar metallicity (i.e (O/H)+12=8.7) and star formation rate uncorrected for dust attenuation of 0.1 M_odot/yr. EOS The quasar spectrum reddened by the foreground galaxy is well fitted with the Milky Way extinction curve (with an Av of 0.44) and the estimated HI column density is similar to the value obtained from 21-cm absorption assuming spin temperature of 100K.	Combining our sample with the z<0.1 data available in the literature, we find the detectability of 21-cm absorption with integrated optical depth greater than 0.1 km\s to be 50% for the impact parameter less than 20 kpc.
doc	Existence of Gibbs States and Maximizing Measures on Generalized XY Models with a Markovian Structure EOS Consider a compact metric space _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS We prove a Ruelle's Perron Frobenius Theorem for a class of compact subshifts with Markovian structure introduced in [Bull. EOS Braz. EOS Math. EOS Soc. EOS 45 (2014), pp. EOS 53-72] which are defined from a continuous function _EQN_ that determines the set of admissible sequences. EOS In particular, this class of subshifts includes the generalized XY model and the class of finite Markov shifts.	We present an explicit expression for the normalized eigenfunction of the Ruelle operator associated to its maximal eigenvalue and an extension of its corresponding Gibbs state to the bilateral approach.
doc	Solution processable and optically switchable 1D photonic structures EOS In this work, we report the first demonstration of a solution processable, optically switchable 1D photonic crystal by implementing phototunable doped metal oxide nanocrystals. EOS The resulting device structure shows bi-photonic response with the photonic bandgap covering the visible spectral range and the plasmon resonance of the doped metal oxide the near infrared. EOS By means of a facile photodoping process, we tuned the plasmonic response and switched effectively the optical properties of the photonic crystal, translating the effect from the near infrared to the visible.	The ultrafast bandgap pumping induces a signal change in the region of the photonic stopband, with recovery times of several picoseconds, providing a step toward the ultrafast optical switching.
doc	The shock driving capability of a CME inferred from multiwavelength observations EOS The radial speed of a coronal mass ejection (CME) determines the shock-driving capability of a CME as indicated by the presence of a type II radio burst.

We used the radio-burst data provided by the San Vito Solar Observatory of the Radio Solar Telescope Network and data from the Wind spacecraft.
doc	Constraining thermal dust emission in distant galaxies with number counts and angular power spectra EOS We perform a joint fit to differential number counts from Spitzer's MIPS and Herschel's SPIRE instruments, and angular power spectra of cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies from SPIRE, Planck, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, which together span 220 < \nu / GHz < 4300 (70 < \lambda / \mu m < 1400). EOS We simultaneously constrain the dust luminosity function, thermal dust spectral energy distribution (SED) and clustering properties of CIB sources, and the evolution of these quantities over cosmic time. EOS We find that the data strongly require redshift evolution in the thermal dust SED. EOS In our adopted parametrization, this evolution takes the form of an increase in graybody dust temperature at high redshift, but it may also be related to a temperature - dust luminosity correlation or evolution in dust opacity.	The counts and spectra together constrain the evolution of the thermal dust luminosity function up to z ~ 2.5-3, complementing approaches relying on rest-frame mid-infrared observations of the rarest bright objects.
doc	Cache-Enabled Broadcast Packet Erasure Channels with State Feedback EOS We consider a cache-enabled K-user broadcast erasure packet channel in which a server with a library of N files wishes to deliver a requested file to each user who is equipped with a cache of a finite memory M.	Assuming that the transmitter has state feedback and user caches can be filled during off-peak hours reliably by decentralized cache placement, we characterize the optimal rate region as a function of the memory size, the erasure probability.
doc	Fractal Analytical Approach of Urban Form Based on Spatial Correlation Function EOS Urban form has been empirically demonstrated to be of scaling invariance and can be described with fractal geometry. EOS However, the rational range of fractal dimension value and the relationships between various fractal indicators of cities are not yet revealed in theory. EOS By mathematical deduction and transformation (e.g. EOS Fourier transform), I find that scaling analysis, spectral analysis, and spatial correlation analysis are all associated with fractal concepts and can be integrated into a new approach to fractal analysis of cities. EOS This method can be termed 3S analyses of urban form. EOS Using the 3S analysis, I derived a set of fractal parameter equations, by which different fractal parameters of cities can be linked up with one another.	Each fractal parameter has its own reasonable extent of values.
doc	CacheShield: Protecting Legacy Processes Against Cache Attacks EOS Cache attacks pose a threat to any code whose execution flow or memory accesses depend on sensitive information. EOS Especially in public clouds, where caches are shared across several tenants, cache attacks remain an unsolved problem. EOS Cache attacks rely on evictions by the spy process, which alter the execution behavior of the victim process. EOS We show that hardware performance events of cryptographic routines reveal the presence of cache attacks. EOS Based on this observation, we propose CacheShield, a tool to protect legacy code by monitoring its execution and detecting the presence of cache attacks, thus providing the opportunity to take preventative measures. EOS CacheShield can be run by users and does not require alteration of the OS or hypervisor, while previously proposed software-based countermeasures require cooperation from the hypervisor. EOS Unlike methods that try to detect malicious processes, our approach is lean, as only a fraction of the system needs to be monitored. EOS It also integrates well into today's cloud infrastructure, as concerned users can opt to use CacheShield without support from the cloud service provider.	Our results show that CacheShield detects cache attacks fast, with high reliability, and with few false positives, even in the presence of strong noise.

doc	On A Semi-Automatic Method for Generating Composition Tables EOS Originating from Allen's Interval Algebra, composition-based reasoning has been widely acknowledged as the most popular reasoning technique in qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. EOS Given a qualitative calculus (i.e. EOS a relation model), the first thing we should do is to establish its composition table (CT). EOS In the past three decades, such work is usually done manually. EOS This is undesirable and error-prone, given that the calculus may contain tens or hundreds of basic relations. EOS Computing the correct CT has been identified by Tony Cohn as a challenge for computer scientists in 1995. EOS This paper addresses this problem and introduces a semi-automatic method to compute the CT by randomly generating triples of elements. EOS For several important qualitative calculi, our method can establish the correct CT in a reasonable short time.	This is illustrated by applications to the Interval Algebra, the Region Connection Calculus RCC-8, the INDU calculus, and the Oriented Point Relation Algebras.
doc	Universal Mixers in All Dimensions EOS We construct universal mixers, incompressible flows that mix arbitrarily well general solutions to the corresponding transport equation, in all dimensions. EOS This mixing is exponential in time (i.e., essentially optimal) for any initial condition with at least some regularity, and we also show that a uniform mixing rate for all initial conditions cannot be achieved.	The flows are uniformly-in-time bounded in spaces _EQN_ for a range of _EQN_ that includes _EQN_ and _EQN_.
doc	Is superhydrophobicity robust with respect to disorder? EOS We consider theoretically the Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states describing the wetting contact angles for rough substrates. EOS More precisely, we consider different types of periodic geometries such as square protrusions and disks in 2D, grooves and nanoparticles in 3D and derive explicitly the contact angle formulas.	We also show how to introduce the concept of surface disorder within the problem and, inspired by biomimetism, study its effect on superhydrophobicity.
doc	Lattice Partition Multiple Access: A New Method of Downlink Non-orthogonal Multiuser Transmissions EOS In this paper, we propose a new downlink non-orthogonal multiuser superposition transmission scheme for future 5G cellular networks, which we refer to as the lattice partition multiple access (LPMA). EOS In this proposed design, the base station transmits multilevel lattice codes for multiple users. EOS Each user's code level corresponds to a distinct prime and is weighted by a product of all distinct primes of the other users excluding its own. EOS Due to the structural property of lattice codes, each user can cancel out the interference from the other code levels by using the modulo lattice operation in a successive/parallel manner. EOS LPMA can overcome the drawback of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which arises when users have similar channel conditions.	We demonstrate that the proposed LPMA shows a clear throughput enhancement over the current NOMA scheme.

doc	General dilatonic gravity with an asymptotically free gravitational coupling constant near two dimensions EOS We study a renormalizable, general theory of dilatonic gravity (with a kinetic-like term for the dilaton) interacting with scalar matter near two dimensions. EOS The one-loop effective action and the beta functions for this general theory are written down. EOS It is proven that the theory possesses a non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point which yields an asymptotically free gravitational coupling constant (at _EQN_) in this regime. EOS Moreover, at the fixed point the theory can be cast under the form of a string-inspired model with free scalar matter.	The renormalization of the Jackiw-Teitelboim model and of lineal gravity in _EQN_ dimensions is also discussed.

doc	Constraints in Hamiltonian time-dependent mechanics EOS In Hamiltonian time-dependent mechanics, the Poisson bracket does not define dynamic equations, that implies the corresponding peculiarities of describing time-dependent holonomic constraints. EOS As in conservative mechanics, one can consider the Poisson bracket of constraints, separate them in first and second class constraints, construct the Koszul-Tate resolution and a BRST complex. EOS However, the Poisson bracket of constraints and a Hamiltonian makes no sense. EOS Hamiltonian vector fields for first class constraints are not generators of gauge transformations. EOS In the case of Lagrangian constraints, we state the comprehensive relations between solutions of the Lagrange equations for an almost regular Lagrangian and solutions of the Hamilton equations for associated Hamiltonian forms, which live in the Lagrangian constraint space.	Degenerate quadratic Lagrangian systems are studied in details.
doc	Acoustic attenuation in a type-II superconductor at high magnetic fields EOS We have calculated the longitudinal acoustic attenuation in a type-II superconductor in high magnetic fields within a mean-field BCS theory. EOS We predict two new features in the corresponding attenuation signal as compared to that of the Meissner state. EOS Our analytical calculations predict the existence of oscillations in the attenuation as the external magnetic field is varied- this effect is associated with the Landau level structure of the electron states and is analogous to the well-known de Haas van Alphen oscillations in the mixed state. EOS The attenuation directly probes the quasiparticle energies;	the presence of gapless points in the quasiparticle spectrum, which is characteristic of type-II superconductors at high magnetic fields, shows up in the frequency and temperature dependence of the attenuation in the limit of low frequency and low temperature respectively.

doc	Screening High-z GRBs with BAT Prompt Emission Properties EOS Detecting high-z GRBs is important for constraining the GRB formation rate, and tracing the history of re-ionization and metallicity of the universe. EOS Based on the current sample of GRBs detected by Swift with known redshifts, we investigated the relationship between red-shift, and spectral and temporal characteristics, using the BAT event-by-event data. EOS We found red-shift trends for the peak-flux-normalized temporal width T90, the light curve variance, the peak flux, and the photon index in simple power-law fit to the BAT event data. EOS We have constructed criteria for screening GRBs with high red-shifts.	This will enable us to provide a much faster alert to the GRB community of possible high-z bursts.
doc	The cloudbow of planet Earth observed in polarisation EOS Scattering processes in the atmospheres of planets cause characteristic features that can be particularly well observed in polarisation. EOS For planet Earth, both molecular and scattering by small particles imprint specific signatures in its phase curve. EOS An unequivocal prediction of a liquid-water-loaded atmosphere is the existence of a rainbow feature at a scattering angle of around 138-144deg. EOS Earthshine allows us to observe the primary rainbow in linear polarisation. EOS We observed polarisation spectra of Earthshine using FORS2 at the Very Large Telescope for phase angles from 33deg to 65deg (Sun--Earth--Moon angle). EOS The spectra were used to derive the degree of polarisation in the B, V, R, and I passbands and the phase curve from 33deg to 136deg. EOS The new observations extend to the smallest phases that can be observed from the ground. EOS The degree of polarisation of planet Earth is increasing for decreasing phase angles downwards of 45deg. EOS From comparison of the phase curve observed with models of an Earth-type atmosphere we are able to determine the refractive index of water and to constrain the mean water droplet sizes to 6-7 mum. EOS Furthermore, we can retrieve the mean cloud fraction of liquid water clouds to 0.3, and the mean optical depth of the water clouds to values between 10 and 20. EOS Our observations allow us to discern two fundamentally different scattering mechanisms of the atmosphere of planet Earth: molecular and particle scattering. EOS The physical and chemical properties can be retrieved with high fidelity through suitable inversion of the phase curve.	Observations of polarimetric phase curves of planets beyond the Solar System shall be extremely valuable for a thorough characterisation of their atmospheres.
doc	Optimal strategies for computing symmetric Boolean functions in collocated networks EOS We address the problem of finding optimal strategies for computing Boolean symmetric functions. EOS We consider a collocated network, where each node's transmissions can be heard by every other node. EOS Each node has a Boolean measurement and we wish to compute a given Boolean function of these measurements with zero error. EOS We allow for block computation to enhance data fusion efficiency, and determine the minimum worst-case total bits to be communicated to perform the desired computation. EOS We restrict attention to the class of symmetric Boolean functions, which only depend on the number of 1s among the n measurements. EOS We define three classes of functions, namely threshold functions, delta functions and interval functions. EOS We provide exactly optimal strategies for the first two classes, and an order-optimal strategy with optimal preconstant for interval functions. EOS Using these results, we can characterize the complexity of computing percentile type functions, which is of great interest.	In our analysis, we use lower bounds from communication complexity theory, and provide an achievable scheme using information theoretic tools.
doc	Growing Self-organized Design of Efficient and Robust Complex Networks EOS A self-organization of efficient and robust networks is important for a future design of communication or transportation systems, however both characteristics are incompatible in many real networks.

We show that, by biologically inspired copying, an onion-like network emerges in the incremental growth with functions of proxy access and reinforced connectivity on a space.

doc	Large zenith angle observations with the high-resolution GRANITE III camera EOS The GRANITE III camera of the Whipple Cherenkov Telescope at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mount Hopkins, Arizona (2300 m a.s.l.) has the highest angular resolution of all cameras used on this telescope so far. EOS The central region of the camera has 379 pixels with an individual angular diameter of 0.12 degrees. EOS This makes the instrument especially suitable for observations of gamma-induced air-showers at large zenith angles since the increase in average distance to the shower maximum leads to smaller shower images in the focal plane of the telescope.	We examine the performance of the telescope for observations of gamma-induced air-showers at zenith angles up to 63 degrees based on observations of Mkn 421 and using Monte Carlo Simulations.
doc	A Super-Condenser for Labelfree Nanoscopy EOS Labelfree nanoscopy encompasses optical imaging with resolution in the 100 nm range using visible wavelengths. EOS Here, we present a labelfree nanoscopy method that combines Fourier ptychography with waveguide microscopy to realize a 'super-condenser' featuring maximally inclined coherent darkfield illumination with artificially stretched wave vectors due to large refractive indices of the employed Si _EQN_ N _EQN_ waveguide material.	We produce the required coherent plane wave illumination for Fourier ptychography over imaging areas 400 _EQN_ m _EQN_ in size via adiabatically tapered single-mode waveguides and tackle the overlap constraints of the Fourier ptychography phase retrieval algorithm two-fold: firstly, the directionality of the illumination wave vector is changed sequentially via a multiplexed input structure of the waveguide chip layout and secondly, the wave vector modulus is shortend via step-wise increases of the illumination light wavelength over the visible spectrum.

doc	A family of higher-order single layer plate models meeting _EQN_ -- requirements for arbitrary laminates EOS In the framework of displacement-based equivalent single layer (ESL) plate theories for laminates, this paper presents a generic and automatic method to extend a basis higher-order shear deformation theory (polynomial, trigonometric, hyperbolic,...) to a multilayer _EQN_ higher-order shear deformation theory. EOS The key idea is to enhance the description of the cross-sectional warping: the odd high-order _EQN_ function of the basis model is replaced by one odd and one even high-order function and including the characteristic zig-zag behaviour by means of piecewise linear functions.	In order to account for arbitrary lamination schemes, four such piecewise continuous functions are considered.
doc	Multifrequency Polarimetry of the Nrao 140 Jet: Possible Detection of a Helical Magnetic Field and Constraints on its Pitch Angle EOS We present results from multifrequency polarimetry of NRAO 140 using the Very Long Baseline Array. EOS These observations allow us to reveal the distributions of both the polarization position angle and the Faraday rotation measure (RM). EOS These distributions are powerful tools to discern the projected and line-of-sight components of the magnetic field, respectively. EOS We find a systematic gradient in the RM distribution, with its sign being opposite at either side of the jet with respect to the jet axis. EOS The sign of the RM changes only with the direction of the magnetic field component along the line of sight, so this can be explained by the existence of helical magnetic components associated with the jet itself. EOS We derive two constraints for the pitch angle of the helical magnetic field from the distributions of the RM and the projected magnetic field;	the RM distribution indicates that the helical fields are tightly wound, while that of the projected magnetic field suggests they are loosely wound around the jet axis.

doc	Trajectory attractor for a non-autonomous Magnetohydrodynamic equations of Non-Newtonian Fluids EOS In this article we initiate the mathematical study of the dynamics of a system of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations modelling the motion of incompressible, isothermal and conducting modified bipolar fluids in presence of magnetic field. EOS We mainly prove the existence of weak solutions to the model. EOS We also prove the existence of a trajectory attractor to the translation semigroup acting on the trajectories of the set of weak solutions and that of external forces.	Some results concerning the structure of this trajectory attractor are also given.
doc	Asymptotic Bayesian Theory of Quickest Change Detection for Hidden Markov Models EOS In the 1960s, Shiryaev developed a Bayesian theory of change-point detection in the i.i.d. EOS case, which was generalized in the beginning of the 2000s by Tartakovsky and Veeravalli for general stochastic models assuming a certain stability of the log-likelihood ratio process. EOS Hidden Markov models represent a wide class of stochastic processes that are very useful in a variety of applications. EOS In this paper, we investigate the performance of the Bayesian Shiryaev change-point detection rule for hidden Markov models. EOS We propose a set of regularity conditions under which the Shiryaev procedure is first-order asymptotically optimal in a Bayesian context, minimizing moments of the detection delay up to certain order asymptotically as the probability of false alarm goes to zero. EOS The developed theory for hidden Markov models is based on Markov chain representation for the likelihood ratio and r-quick convergence for Markov random walks. EOS In addition, applying Markov nonlinear renewal theory, we present a high-order asymptotic approximation for the expected delay to detection of the Shiryaev detection rule. EOS Asymptotic properties of another popular change detection rule, the Shiryaev Roberts rule, is studied as well.	Some interesting examples are given for illustration.
doc	Structural and Dynamical Mechanisms of a Naturally Occurring Variant of the Human Prion Protein in Preventing Prion Conversion EOS Prion diseases are associated with the misfolding of the normal helical cellular form of prion protein (PrPC) into the beta-sheet-rich scrapie form (PrPSc) and the subsequent aggregation of PrPSc into amyloid fibrils. EOS Recent studies demonstrated that a naturally occurring variant V127 of human PrPC is intrinsically resistant to prion conversion and aggregation, and can completely prevent prion diseases.	However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive.
doc	Provenance Traces EOS Provenance is information about the origin, derivation, ownership, or history of an object. EOS It has recently been studied extensively in scientific databases and other settings due to its importance in helping scientists judge data validity, quality and integrity. EOS However, most models of provenance have been stated as ad hoc definitions motivated by informal concepts such as "comes from", "influences", "produces", or "depends on". EOS These models lack clear formalizations describing in what sense the definitions capture these intuitive concepts. EOS This makes it difficult to compare approaches, evaluate their effectiveness, or argue about their validity. EOS We introduce provenance traces, a general form of provenance for the nested relational calculus (NRC), a core database query language.	Provenance traces can be thought of as concrete data structures representing the operational semantics derivation of a computation;
doc	Coupling of (ultra-)relativistic atomic nuclei with photons EOS The coupling of photons with (ultra-) relativistic atomic nuclei is presented in two particular circumstances: very high electromagnetic fields and very short photon pulses. EOS We consider a typical situation where the (bare) nuclei (fully stripped of electrons) are accelerated to energies ~1TeV per nucleon (according to the state of the art at LHC, for instance) and photon sources like petawatt lasers \simeq1eV -radiation (envisaged by ELI-NP project, for instance), or free-electron laser ~10keV -radiation, or synchrotron sources, etc. EOS In these circumstances the nuclear scale energy can be attained, with very high field intensities. EOS In particular, we analyse the nuclear transitions induced by the radiation, including both one- and two-photon processes, as well as the polarization-driven transitions which may lead to giant dipole resonances. EOS The nuclear (electrical) polarization concept is introduced.	It is shown that the perturbation theory for photo-nuclear reactions is applicable, although the field intensity is high, since the corresponding interaction energy is low and the interaction time (pulse duration) is short.
doc	Higgs-otic Inflation and String Theory EOS We propose that inflation is driven by a (complex) neutral Higgs of the MSSM extension of the SM, in a chaotic-like inflation setting. EOS The SUSY breaking soft term masses are of order _EQN_ GeV, which is identified with the inflaton mass scale and is just enough to stabilise the SM Higgs potential.	The fine-tuned SM Higgs has then a mass around 126 GeV, in agreement with LHC results.
doc	Uniform Rectifiability and Harmonic Measure III: Riesz transform bounds imply uniform rectifiability of boundaries of 1-sided NTA domains EOS Let _EQN_, _EQN_, be a closed, Ahlfors-David regular set of dimension _EQN_ satisfying the "Riesz Transform bound" _EQN_ Assume further that _EQN_ is the boundary of a domain _EQN_ satisfying the Harnack Chain condition plus an interior (but not exterior) Corkscrew condition.	Then _EQN_ is uniformly rectifiable.
doc	Outage Analysis of _EQN_ MIMO-MRC in Correlated Rician Fading EOS This paper addresses one of the classical problems in random matrix theory-- finding the distribution of the maximum eigenvalue of the correlated Wishart unitary ensemble. EOS In particular, we derive a new exact expression for the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the maximum eigenvalue of a _EQN_ correlated non-central Wishart matrix with rank- _EQN_ mean. EOS By using this new result, we derive an exact analytical expression for the outage probability of _EQN_ multiple-input multiple-output maximum-ratio-combining (MIMO-MRC) in Rician fading with transmit correlation and a strong line-of-sight (LoS) component (rank- _EQN_ channel mean). EOS We also show that the outage performance is affected by the relative alignment of the eigen-spaces of the mean and correlation matrices. EOS In general, when the LoS path aligns with the least eigenvector of the correlation matrix, in the high transmit signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the outage gradually improves with the increasing correlation. EOS Moreover, we show that as _EQN_ (Rician factor) grows large, the outage event can be approximately characterized by the c.d.f.	of a certain Gaussian random variable.

doc	Very Large Intermediate Breaking Scale In The Gepner Three Generation Model EOS A detailed study of the intermediate symmetry breaking scale, via the renormalization group equations, for a three generation heterotic string model arising from the N=2 superconformal construction is reported. EOS The numerical study shows that the model admits a very large intermediate breaking scale _EQN_ GeV. EOS The role of the gauge singlets in this model is studied, and it is found that these fields play a crucial role in determining the directions and the scale of the intermediate symmetry breaking. EOS The importance of the mixing in generation space is also studied. EOS The generation mixing terms are found to have special effects in the intermediate symmetry breaking. EOS Remarkably these terms can produce some new Yukawa couplings (not present at the Planck scale) through loops.	These couplings are in general very small compared to the ones with non-vanishing tree level values and thus offer a new mechanism to solve the lepton/quark mass hierarchy problem.
doc	The Two-Component Non-Perturbative Pomeron and the G-Universality EOS In this communication we present a generalization of the Donnachie-Landshoff model inspired by the recent discovery of a 2-component Pomeron in LLA-QCD by Bartels, Lipatov and Vacca. EOS In particular, we explore a new property, not present in the usual Regge theory - the G-Universality - which signifies the independence of one of the Pomeron components on the nature of the initial and final hadrons.	The best description of all the forward hadron-hadron, gamma- gamma and gamma-proton data is obtained when G-universailty is imposed.

doc	Lung Cancer Detection using Co-learning from Chest CT Images and Clinical Demographics EOS Early detection of lung cancer is essential in reducing mortality. EOS Recent studies have demonstrated the clinical utility of low-dose computed tomography (CT) to detect lung cancer among individuals selected based on very limited clinical information. EOS However, this strategy yields high false positive rates, which can lead to unnecessary and potentially harmful procedures. EOS To address such challenges, we established a pipeline that co-learns from detailed clinical demographics and 3D CT images. EOS Toward this end, we leveraged data from the Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions (MCL), which focuses on early detection of lung cancer. EOS A 3D attention-based deep convolutional neural net (DCNN) is proposed to identify lung cancer from the chest CT scan without prior anatomical location of the suspicious nodule. EOS To improve upon the non-invasive discrimination between benign and malignant, we applied a random forest classifier to a dataset integrating clinical information to imaging data.	The results show that the AUC obtained from clinical demographics alone was 0.635 while the attention network alone reached an accuracy of 0.687.
doc	Solitary beam propagation in a nonlinear optical resonator enables high-efficiency pulse compression and mode self-cleaning EOS Generating intense ultrashort pulses with high-quality spatial modes is crucial for ultrafast and strong-field science.

doc	Quantum Circuits for Incompletely Specified Two-Qubit Operators EOS While the question ``how many CNOT gates are needed to simulate an arbitrary two-qubit operator'' has been conclusively answered -- three are necessary and sufficient -- previous work on this topic assumes that one wants to simulate a given unitary operator up to global phase. EOS However, in many practical cases additional degrees of freedom are allowed. EOS For example, if the computation is to be followed by a given projective measurement, many dissimilar operators achieve the same output distributions on all input states.	Alternatively, if it is known that the input state is |0>, the action of the given operator on all orthogonal states is immaterial.

doc	Target shape dependence in a simple model of receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis EOS Phagocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis are vitally important particle uptake mechanisms in many cell types, ranging from single-cell organisms to immune cells. EOS In both processes, engulfment by the cell depends critically on both particle shape and orientation.	However, most previous theoretical work has focused only on spherical particles and hence disregards the wide-ranging particle shapes occurring in nature, such as those of bacteria.

doc	The degeneracy between the dust colour temperature and the spectral index. The problem of multiple chi^2 minima EOS Because of the Herschel and Planck satellite missions, there is strong interest in the interpretation the sub-millimetre dust spectra from interstellar clouds. EOS Much work has been done to understand the dependence between the spectral index beta_Obs and the colour temperature T_C that is partly caused by the noise. EOS The (T_C, beta_Obs) confidence regions are elongated, banana-shaped structures. EOS We studied under which conditions these exhibit anomalous, strongly non-Gaussian behaviour that could affect the interpretation of the observed (T_C, beta_Obs) relations. EOS We examined modified black body spectra and spectra calculated from radiative transfer models of filamentary clouds at wavelengths 100um-850um. EOS We performed modified black body fits and examined the structure of the chi^2(T_, beta_Obs) function. EOS We show cases where, when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, the chi^2 has multiple local minima in the (T_C, beta_Obs) plane. EOS A small change in the weighting of the data points can cause the solution to jump to completely different values. EOS In particular, noise can lead to the appearance of a separate population of solutions with low colour temperatures and high spectral indices. EOS The anomalies are caused by the noise but the tendency to show multiple chi^2 minima depends on the model and the wavelengths analysed. EOS Deviations from the assumed single modified black body spectrum are not important. EOS The presence of local minima implies that the results obtained from the chi^2 minimisation depend on the starting point of the optimisation and may correspond to non-global minima.	The (T_C,beta_Obs) distributions may be contaminated by a few solutions with unrealistically low colour temperatures and high spectral indices.
doc	Constraining Dust Extinction Properties via the VVV Survey EOS Near-infrared color-excess and extinction ratios are essential for establishing the cosmic distance scale and probing the Galaxy, particularly when analyzing targets attenuated by significant dust. EOS A robust determination of those ratios followed from leveraging new infrared observations from the VVV survey, wherein numerous bulge RR Lyrae and Type II Cepheids were discovered, in addition to _EQN_ data for classical Cepheids and O-stars occupying the broader Galaxy.	The apparent optical color-excess ratios vary significantly with Galactic longitude (_EQN_), whereas the near-infrared results are comparatively constant with _EQN_ and Galactocentric distance (_EQN_).
doc	Polarimetric Guided Nonlocal Means Covariance Matrix Estimation for Defoliation Mapping EOS In this study we investigate the potential for using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to provide high resolution defoliation and regrowth mapping of trees in the tundra-forest ecotone. EOS Using aerial photographs, four areas with live forest and four areas with dead trees were identified. EOS Quad-polarimetric SAR data from RADARSAT-2 was collected from the same area, and the complex multilook polarimetric covariance matrix was calculated using a novel extension of guided nonlocal means speckle filtering. EOS The nonlocal approach allows us to preserve the high spatial resolution of single-look complex data, which is essential for accurate mapping of the sparsely scattered trees in the study area.	Using a standard random forest classification algorithm, our filtering results in over _EQN_ classification accuracy, higher than traditional speckle filtering methods, and on par with the classification accuracy based on optical data.
doc	An Analysis of Optimal Link Bombs EOS We analyze the phenomenon of collusion for the purpose of boosting the pagerank of a node in an interlinked environment. EOS We investigate the optimal attack pattern for a group of nodes (attackers) attempting to improve the ranking of a specific node (the victim). EOS We consider attacks where the attackers can only manipulate their own outgoing links. EOS We show that the optimal attacks in this scenario are uncoordinated, i.e. EOS the attackers link directly to the victim and no one else. EOS nodes do not link to each other.	We also discuss optimal attack patterns for a group that wants to hide itself by not pointing directly to the victim.
doc	High Performance, Continuously Tunable Microwave Filters using MEMS Devices with Very Large, Controlled, Out-of-Plane Actuation EOS Software defined radios (SDR) in the microwave X and K bands offer the promise of low cost, programmable operation with real-time frequency agility. EOS However, the real world in which such radios operate requires them to be able to detect nanowatt signals in the vicinity of 100 kW transmitters. EOS This imposes the need for selective RF filters on the front end of the receiver to block the large, out of band RF signals so that the finite dynamic range of the SDR is not overwhelmed and the desired nanowatt signals can be detected and digitally processed. EOS This is currently typically done with a number of narrow band filters that are switched in and out under program control. EOS What is needed is a small, fast, wide tuning range, high Q, low loss filter that can continuously tune over large regions of the microwave spectrum. EOS In this paper we show how extreme throw MEMS actuators can be used to build such filters operating up to 15 GHz and beyond. EOS The key enabling attribute of our MEMS actuators is that they have large, controllable, out-of-plane actuation ranges of a millimeter or more.	In a capacitance-post loaded cavity filter geometry, this gives sufficient precisely controllable motion to produce widely tunable devices in the 4-15 GHz regime.

doc	Current-phase relations of InAs nanowire Josephson junctions: from interacting to multi-mode regimes EOS Gate-tunable semiconductor-superconductor nanowires with superconducting leads form exotic Josephson junctions that are a highly desirable platform for two types of qubits: those with topological superconductivity (Majorana qubits) and those based on tunable anharmonicity (gatemon qubits). EOS Controlling their behavior, however, requires understanding their electrostatic environment and electronic structure. EOS Here we study gated InAs nanowires with epitaxial aluminum shells.	By measuring current-phase relations (CPR) and comparing them with analytical and numerical calculations, we show that we can tune the number of modes, determine the transparency of each mode, and tune into regimes in which electron-electron interactions are apparent, indicating the presence of a quantum dot.

doc	Universal skein theory for group actions EOS Given a group action on a finite set, we define the group-action model which consists of tensor network diagrams which are invariant under the group symmetry. EOS In particular, group-action models can be realized as the even part of group-subgroup subfactor planar algebras. EOS Moreover, all group-subgroup subfactor planar algebras arise in this way from transitive actions. EOS In this paper, we provide a universal skein theory for those planar algebras.	With the help of this skein theory, we give a positive answer to a question asked by Vaughan Jones in the late nineties.
doc	Continuum Charge Excitations in High-Valence Transition-Metal Oxides Revealed by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering EOS We present a theoretical investigation of the origin of Raman-like and fluorescencelike (FL) features of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra. EOS Using a combination of local-density approximation + dynamical mean-field theory and a configuration interaction solver for Anderson impurity model, we calculate the _EQN_ -edge RIXS and x-ray absorption spectra of high-valence transition-metal oxides LaCuO _EQN_ and NaCuO _EQN_. EOS We analyze in detail the behavior of the FL feature and show how it is connected to the details of electronic and crystal structure.	On the studied compounds we demonstrate how material details determine whether the electron-hole continuum can be excited in the _EQN_ -edge RIXS process.
doc	Towards Self-Tuning Parameter Servers EOS Recent years, many applications have been driven advances by the use of Machine Learning (ML). EOS Nowadays, it is common to see industrial-strength machine learning jobs that involve millions of model parameters, terabytes of training data, and weeks of training. EOS Good efficiency, i.e., fast completion time of running a specific ML job, therefore, is a key feature of a successful ML system. EOS While the completion time of a long-running ML job is determined by the time required to reach model convergence, practically that is also largely influenced by the values of various system settings. EOS In this paper, we contribute techniques towards building self-tuning parameter servers. EOS Parameter Server (PS) is a popular system architecture for large-scale machine learning systems; EOS and by self-tuning we mean while a long-running ML job is iteratively training the expert-suggested model, the system is also iteratively learning which system setting is more efficient for that job and applies it online.	While our techniques are general enough to various PS-style ML systems, we have prototyped our techniques on top of TensorFlow.
doc	Disentangled Representations for Domain-generalized Cardiac Segmentation EOS Robust cardiac image segmentation is still an open challenge due to the inability of the existing methods to achieve satisfactory performance on unseen data of different domains. EOS Since the acquisition and annotation of medical data are costly and time-consuming, recent work focuses on domain adaptation and generalization to bridge the gap between data from different populations and scanners. EOS In this paper, we propose two data augmentation methods that focus on improving the domain adaptation and generalization abilities of state-to-the-art cardiac segmentation models.	In particular, our "Resolution Augmentation" method generates more diverse data by rescaling images to different resolutions within a range spanning different scanner protocols.
doc	Revisiting the lower bound on tidal deformability derived by AT 2017gfo EOS We revisit the lower bound on binary tidal deformability tilde Lambda imposed by a luminous kilonova/macronova, AT 2017gfo, by numerical-relativity simulations of models that are consistent with gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger GW170817. EOS Contrary to the claim made in the literature, we find that binaries with tilde Lambda <~400 can explain the luminosity of AT 2017gfo, as long as moderate mass ejection from the remnant is assumed as had been done in previous work.	The reason is that the maximum mass of a neutron star is not strongly correlated with the tidal deformability of neutron stars with a typical mass of ~1.4M_sun.
doc	The Influence of Supershells and Galactic Outflows on the Escape of Ionizing Radiation from Dwarf Starburst Galaxies EOS We study the escape of Lyman continuum radiation from the disks of dwarf starburst galaxies, with and without supershells, by solving the radiation transfer problem of stellar radiation through them. EOS We model disks with Md=10^8-10Msun, with exponential surface density profiles as a function of redshift, and model the of repeated supernova explosions driving supershells out of the disks, using the hydrodynamic simulation code, ZEUS-3D. EOS The amount of star formation is assumed proportional to mass above some density threshold. EOS We vary the threshold to explore the range of star formation efficiencies, f*=0.006, 0.06, and 0.6. EOS We find that the interstellar gas swept up in dense supershells can effectively trap the ionizing photons, before the supershells blow out of the disks.	The blow-outs then create galactic outflows, chimneys which allow the photons to escape directly to the intergalactic medium.
doc	Functional Dependencies Unleashed for Scalable Data Exchange EOS We address the problem of efficiently evaluating target functional dependencies (fds) in the Data Exchange (DE) process. EOS Target fds naturally occur in many DE scenarios, including the ones in Life Sciences in which multiple source relations need to be structured under a constrained target schema. EOS However, despite their wide use, target fds' evaluation is still a bottleneck in the state-of-the-art DE engines. EOS Systems relying on an all-SQL approach typically do not support target fds unless additional information is provided. EOS Alternatively, DE engines that do include these dependencies typically pay the price of a significant drop in performance and scalability. EOS In this paper, we present a novel chase-based algorithm that can efficiently handle arbitrary fds on the target. EOS Our approach essentially relies on exploiting the interactions between source-to-target (s-t) tuple-generating dependencies (tgds) and target fds.	This allows us to tame the size of the intermediate chase results, by playing on a careful ordering of chase steps interleaving fds and (chosen) tgds.

doc	Vaccination with Leishmania mexicana LPG induces PD-1 in CD8+ and PD-L2 in macrophages thereby suppressing the immune response: A model to assess vaccine efficacy EOS Leishmania lipophosphoglycan is a molecule that has been used as a vaccine candidate, with contradictory results. EOS Since unsuccessful protection could be related to suppressed T cell responses, we analyzed the expression of inhibitory receptor PD-1 in CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocytes and it is ligand PD-L2 in macrophages of BALB/c mice immunized with various doses of Leishmania mexicana LPG and re-stimulated in vitro with different concentrations of LPG. EOS Vaccination with LPG enhanced the expression of PD-1 in CD8+ cells. EOS Activation molecules CD137 were reduced in CD8+ cells from vaccinated mice. EOS In vitro re-stimulation enhanced PD-L2 expression in macrophages of healthy mice in a dose-dependent fashion.	The expression of PD-1, PD-L2, and CD137 is modulated according to the amount of LPG used during immunization and in vitro re-stimulation.
doc	VLA Polarimetry of Two Extended Radio Galaxies EOS Multi-wavelength VLA observations of two extended radio galaxies, 0235-197 and 1203+043 are presented. EOS There is some evidence from earlier studies that these two sources exhibit low frequency (<1 GHz) variability. EOS This work shows that both sources have linear polarizations, if any, below the detection limits at 320 MHz, so we cannot explain the variability as being due to instrumental polarization effects as has been suggested for 3C159. EOS Refractive scintillation may be the cause of the variability in 0235-197. EOS This would require the existence of a bright, compact component in one of the hot spots seen in these observations. EOS This is not implausible but the resolution of this observational program is insufficent to address that question. EOS The radio source 1203+043 lacks any bright compact component thereby ruling out a refractive scintillation mechanism for its variability. EOS Consequently, it is possible that claims of variability in this source are spurious. EOS However, the 320 MHz VLA observations show that 1203+043 has an `X'-shaped radio structure. EOS This is a rare morphology for the brightness distribution of a radio galaxy;	the implications of this are examined.

doc	Free energy of formation of clusters of sulphuric acid and water molecules determined by guided disassembly EOS We evaluate the grand potential of a cluster of two molecular species, equivalent to its free energy of formation from a binary vapour phase, using a nonequilibrium molecular dynamics technique where guide particles, each tethered to a molecule by a harmonic force, move apart to disassemble a cluster into its components. EOS The mechanical work performed in an ensemble of trajectories is analysed using the Jarzynski equality to obtain a free energy of disassembly, a contribution to the cluster grand potential. EOS We study clusters of sulphuric acid and water at 300 K, using a classical interaction scheme, and contrast two modes of guided disassembly. EOS In one, the cluster is broken apart through simple pulling by the guide particles, but we find the trajectories tend to be mechanically irreversible.	In the second approach, the guide motion and strength of tethering are modified in a way that prises the cluster apart, a procedure that seems more reversible.

This method is suitable for spectra of FGK-type stars in medium and high resolution.
doc	ALMA Maps of Dust and Warm Dense Gas Emission in the Starburst Galaxy IC 5179 _EQN_ EOS We present our high-resolution (_EQN_, _EQN_ 34 pc) observations of the CO(6-5) line emission, which probes the warm and dense molecular gas, and the 434 _EQN_ m dust continuum emission in the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy IC 5179, conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). EOS The CO(6-5) emission is spatially distributed in filamentary structures with many dense cores and shows a velocity field that is characteristic of a circum-nuclear rotating gas disk, with 90% of the rotation speed arising within a radius of _EQN_ pc. EOS At the scale of our spatial resolution, the CO(6-5) and dust emission peaks do not always coincide, with their surface brightness ratio varying by a factor of _EQN_ 10.	This result suggests that their excitation mechanisms are likely different, as further evidenced by the Southwest to Northeast spatial gradient of both CO-to-dust continuum ratio and Pa- _EQN_ equivalent width.

However, their presence furnishes baryon number which decreases the relative concentrations of nucleons.
doc	Waveforms of compact binary inspiral gravitational radiation in screened modified gravity EOS Scalar-tensor gravity, with the screening mechanisms to avoid the severe constraints of the fifth force in the Solar System, can be described with a unified theoretical framework, the so-called screened modified gravity (SMG). EOS Within this framework, in this paper we calculate the waveforms of gravitational-waves (GWs) emitted by inspiral compact binaries, which include four polarization modes, the plus _EQN_, cross _EQN_, breathing _EQN_, and longitudinal _EQN_ modes. EOS The scalar polarizations _EQN_ and _EQN_ are both caused by the scalar field of SMG, and satisfy a simple linear relation. EOS With the stationary phase approximations, we obtain their Fourier transforms, and derive the correction terms in the amplitude, phase, and polarizations of GWs, relative to the corresponding results in general relativity. EOS The corresponding parametrized post-Einsteinian parameters in the general SMG are also identified.	Imposing the noise level of the ground-based Einstein Telescope, we find that GW detections from inspiral compact binaries composed of a neutron star and a black hole can place stringent constraints on the sensitivities of neutron stars, and the bound is applicable to any SMG theory.
doc	Comparison of Loss ratios of different scheduling algorithms EOS It is well known that in a firm real time system with a renewal arrival process, exponential service times and independent and identically distributed deadlines till the end of service of a job, the earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling policy has smaller loss ratio (expected fraction of jobs, not completed) than any other service time independent scheduling policy, including the first come first served (FCFS). EOS Various modifications to the EDF and FCFS policies have been proposed in the literature, with a view to improving performance.	In this article, we compare the loss ratios of these two policies along with some of the said modifications, as well as their counterparts with deterministic deadlines.

EOS We modeled the temporal evolution of the radius, temperature, intrinsic luminosity, and the blackbody spectrum of distant ice giant planets. EOS The aim is also to provide estimates of the magnitudes in different bands to assess whether the object might be detectable.	Simulations of the cooling and contraction were conducted for ice giants with masses of 5, 10, 20, and 50 Mearth that are located at 280, 700, and 1120 AU from the Sun.

doc	High-resolution near-infrared speckle interferometry and radiative transfer modeling of the OH/IR star OH 104.9+2.4 EOS We present near-infrared speckle interferometry of the OH/IR star OH 104.9+2.4 in the K' band obtained with the 6m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO). EOS At a wavelength of lambda = 2.12 micron the diffraction-limited resolution of 74 mas was attained. EOS The reconstructed visibility reveals a spherically symmetric, circumstellar dust shell (CDS) surrounding the central star. EOS The visibility function shows that the stellar contribution to the total flux at lambda = 2.12 micron is less than ~50%, indicating a rather large optical depth of the CDS. EOS The azimuthally averaged 1-dimensional Gaussian visibility fit yields a diameter of 47 +/- 3mas (FHWM), which corresponds to 112 +/- 13 AU for an adopted distance of D = 2.38 +/- 0.24 kpc. EOS To determine the structure and the properties of the CDS of OH 104.9+2.4, radiative transfer calculations using the code DUSTY were performed to simultaneously model its visibility and the spectral energy distribution (SED). EOS We found that both the ISO spectrum and the visibility of OH 104.9+2.4 can be well reproduced by a radiative transfer model with an effective temperature T_eff = 2500 +/- 500 K of the central source, a dust temperature T_in = 1000 +/- 200 K at the inner shell boundary R_in = 9.1 R_star = 25.4 AU, an optical depth tau = 6.5 +/- 0.3 at 2.2 micron, and dust grain radii ranging from a_min = 0.005 +/- 0.003 micron to a_max = 0.2 +/- 0.02 micron with a power law with index -3.5.	It was found that even minor changes in a_max have a major impact on both the slope and the curvature of the visibility function, while the SED shows only minor changes.
doc	Fault-tolerant Coding for Quantum Communication EOS Designing encoding and decoding circuits to reliably send messages over many uses of a noisy channel is a central problem in communication theory. EOS When studying the optimal transmission rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing error it is usually assumed that these circuits can be implemented using noise-free gates. EOS While this assumption is satisfied for classical machines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near term future for quantum machines where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum gates. EOS As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of quantum channel coding remain open. EOS By combining techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the study of these questions.	We introduce fault-tolerant versions of quantum capacities quantifying the optimal communication rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing total error when the encoding and decoding circuits are affected by gate errors with small probability.
doc	Reciprocity and the Emergence of Power Laws in Social Networks EOS Research in network science has shown that many naturally occurring and technologically constructed networks are scale free, that means a power law degree distribution emerges from a growth model in which each new node attaches to the existing network with a probability proportional to its number of links (=degree). EOS Little is known about whether the same principles of local attachment and global properties apply to societies as well. EOS Empirical evidence from six ethnographic case studies shows that complex social networks have significantly lower scaling exponents gamma ~ 1 than have been assumed in the past. EOS Apparently humans do not only look for the most prominent players to play with.	Moreover cooperation in humans is characterized through reciprocity, the tendency to give to those from whom one has received in the past.
doc	Knee structure in high-energy inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons EOS We study the inverse Compton scattering of the CMB photons off nonthermal high-energy electrons. EOS In the previous study, assuming the power-law distribution for electrons, we derived the analytic expression for the spectral intensity function _EQN_ in the Thomson approximation, which was applicable up to the photon energies of _EQN_ O(GeV). EOS In the present paper, we extend the previous work to higher photon energies of _EQN_ O(GeV) by taking into account the terms dropped in the Thomson approximation, i.e., the Klein-Nishina formula. EOS The analytic expression for _EQN_ is derived with the Klein-Nishina formula. EOS It is shown that _EQN_ has a "knee" structure at _EQN_ O(PeV). EOS The knee, if exists, should be accessible with gamma-ray observatories such as Fermi-LAT.	We propose simple analytical formulae for _EQN_ which are applicable to wide photon energies from Thomson region to extreme Klein-Nishina region.
doc	Sum Over Histories: Discrete Step Interpretation EOS We study the transition of a particle between two points such that the particle takes discrete spatial steps in this transition. EOS We analyze how the sum over histories interpretation of quantum mechanics can be implemented in this scenario.	We show that the Euclidean propagator of a free particle is recovered if the minimum space interval is of the order or greater than the De Broglie's wavelength of the particle.
doc	Dynamics of the contact between a ruthenium surface with a single nanoasperity and a flat ruthenium surface: Molecular dynamics simulations EOS We study the dynamics of the contact between a pair of surfaces (with properties designed to mimic ruthenium) via molecular dynamics simulations. EOS In particular, we study the contact between a ruthenium surface with a single nanoasperity and a flat ruthenium surface.	The results of such simulations suggest that contact behavior is highly variable.
doc	Pseudoachromatic and connected-pseudoachromatic indices of the complete graph EOS A complete _EQN_ -coloring of a graph _EQN_ is a (not necessarily proper) _EQN_ -coloring of the vertices of _EQN_, such that each pair of different colors appears in an edge. EOS A complete _EQN_ -coloring is also called connected, if each color class induces a connected subgraph of _EQN_. EOS The pseudoachromatic index of a graph _EQN_, denoted by _EQN_, is the largest _EQN_ for which the line graph of _EQN_ has a complete _EQN_ -coloring. EOS Analogously the connected-pseudoachromatic index of _EQN_, denoted by _EQN_, is the largest _EQN_ for which the line graph of _EQN_ has a connected and complete _EQN_ -coloring. EOS In this paper we study these two parameters for the complete graph _EQN_. EOS Our main contribution is to improve the linear lower bound for the connected pseudoachromatic index given by Abrams and Berman [Australas J Combin 60 (2014), 314--324] and provide an upper bound. EOS These two bounds prove that for any integer _EQN_ the order of _EQN_ is _EQN_.	Related to the pseudoachromatic index we prove that for _EQN_ a power of _EQN_ and _EQN_, _EQN_ is at least _EQN_ which improves the bound _EQN_ given by Araujo, Montellano and Strausz [J Graph Theory 66 (2011), 89--97].
doc	On the origin of the scatter around the Fundamental Plane: correlations with stellar population parameters EOS We present a fundamental plane (FP) analysis of 141 early-type galaxies in the Shapley supercluster at z=0.049 based on spectroscopy from the AAOmega spectrograph at the AAT and photometry from the WFI on the ESO/MPI 2.2m telescope. EOS The key feature of the survey is its coverage of low-mass galaxies down to sigma_0~50km/s. EOS We obtain a best-fitting FP relation log r_e=1.06 log sigma_0 - 0.82 log < I >_e + cst in the R band. EOS The shallow exponent of sigma_0 is a result of the extension of our sample to low velocity dispersions.	We investigate the origin of the intrinsic FP scatter, using estimates of age, metallicity and alpha/Fe.
doc	Superconductors as giant atoms predicted by the theory of hole superconductivity EOS The theory of hole superconductivity proposes that superconductivity originates in the fundamental electron-hole asymmetry of condensed matter and that it is an 'undressing' transition. EOS Here we propose that a natural consequence of this theory is that superconductors behave as giant atoms. EOS The model predicts that the charge distribution in superconductors is inhomogeneous, with higher concentration of negative charge near the surface. EOS Some of this negative charge will spill out, giving rise to a negative electron layer right outside the surface of the superconductor, which should be experimentally detectable.	Also superconductors should have a tendency to easily lose negative charge and become positively charged.
doc	VLT/SPHERE survey for exoplanets around young, early-type stars including systems with multi-belt architectures EOS Dusty debris disks around pre- and main-sequence stars are potential signposts for the existence of planetesimals and exoplanets. EOS Giant planet formation is therefore expected to play a key role in the evolution of the disk. EOS This is indirectly confirmed by extant sub-millimeter near-infrared images of young protoplanetary and cool dusty debris disks around main sequence stars usually showing substantial spatial structures. EOS A majority of recent discoveries of imaged giant planets have been obtained around young, early-type stars hosting a circumstellar disk. EOS In this context, we have carried out a direct imaging program designed to maximize our chances of giant planet discovery and targeting twenty-two young, early-type stars. EOS About half of them show indication of multi-belt architectures. EOS Using the IRDIS dual-band imager and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE to acquire high-constrast coronagraphic differential near-infrared images, we have conducted a systematic search in the close environment of these young, dusty and early-type stars. EOS We confirmed that companions detected around HIP 34276, HIP 101800 and HIP 117452 are stationary background sources and binary companions.	The companion candidates around HIP 8832, HIP 16095 and HIP 95619 are determined as background contamination.
doc	Dynamics and interactions of active rotors EOS We consider a simple model of an internally driven self-rotating object; EOS a rotor, confined to two dimensions by a thin film of low Reynolds number fluid. EOS We undertake a detailed study of the hydrodynamic interactions between a pair of rotors and find that their effect on the resulting dynamics is a combination of fast and slow motions. EOS We analyse the slow dynamics using an averaging procedure to take account of the fast degrees of freedom. EOS Analytical results are compared with numerical simulations. EOS Hydrodynamic interactions mean that while isolated rotors do not translate, bringing together a pair of rotors leads to motion of their centres.	Two rotors spinning in the same sense rotate with an approximately constant angular velocity around each other, while two rotors of opposite sense, both translate with the same constant velocity, which depends on the separation of the pair.
doc	Is the radion a chameleon? EOS The chameleon mechanism is a way to give an effective mass to a light scalar field via field self-interaction and interaction with matter.

doc	Heavy Baryon Mixing in Chiral Perturbation Theory EOS We discuss the SU(3) and heavy quark spin-symmetry breaking mixing between the Xi_c and Xi'_c charmed baryons. EOS Chromomagnetic hyperfine interactions are the leading source of spin-symmetry breaking and together with the SU(3) breaking mass differences between the lightest pseudo-Goldstone bosons gives the leading contribution to the mixing.	Such contributions are computed in chiral perturbation theory and compared to quark model expectations.

doc	Applications of Uniform Sampling: Densest Subgraph and Beyond EOS Recently [Bhattacharya et al, STOC 2015] provide the first non-trivial algorithm for the densest subgraph problem in the streaming model with additions and deletions to its edges, i.e., for dynamic graph streams. EOS They present a _EQN_ -approximation algorithm using _EQN_ space, where factors of _EQN_ and _EQN_ are suppressed in the _EQN_ notation. EOS However, the update time of this algorithm is large. EOS To remedy this, they also provide a _EQN_ -approximation algorithm using _EQN_ space with update time _EQN_. EOS In this paper we improve the algorithms by Bhattacharya et al by providing a _EQN_ -approximation algorithm using _EQN_ space. EOS Our algorithm is conceptually simple - it samples _EQN_ edges uniformly at random, and finds the densest subgraph on the sampled graph. EOS We also show how to perform this sampling with update time _EQN_. EOS In addition to this, we show that given oracle access to the edge set, we can implement our algorithm in time _EQN_ on a graph in the standard RAM model.	To the best of our knowledge this is the fastest _EQN_ -approximation algorithm for the densest subgraph problem in the RAM model given such oracle access.

doc	PTF12os and iPTF13bvn. Two stripped-envelope supernovae from low-mass progenitors in NGC 5806 EOS We investigate two stripped-envelope supernovae (SNe) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 5806 by the (i)PTF. EOS These SNe, designated PTF12os/SN 2012P and iPTF13bvn, exploded at a similar distance from the host-galaxy center. EOS We classify PTF12os as a Type IIb SN based on our spectral sequence; EOS iPTF13bvn has previously been classified as Type Ib having a likely progenitor with zero age main sequence (ZAMS) mass below ~17 solar masses. EOS Our main objective is to constrain the explosion parameters of iPTF12os and iPTF13bvn, and to put constraints on the SN progenitors. EOS We present comprehensive datasets on the SNe, and introduce a new reference-subtraction pipeline (FPipe) currently in use by the iPTF. EOS We perform a detailed study of the light curves (LCs) and spectral evolution of the SNe. EOS The bolometric LCs are modeled using the hydrodynamical code HYDE. EOS We use nebular models and late-time spectra to constrain the ZAMS mass of the progenitors. EOS We perform image registration of ground-based images of PTF12os to archival HST images of NGC 5806 to identify a potential progenitor candidate. EOS Our nebular spectra of iPTF13bvn indicate a low ZAMS mass of ~12 solar masses for the progenitor. EOS The late-time spectra of PTF12os are consistent with a ZAMS mass of ~15 solar masses. EOS We successfully identify a progenitor candidate to PTF12os using archival HST images. EOS This source is consistent with being a cluster of massive stars.	Our hydrodynamical modeling suggests that the progenitor of PTF12os had a compact He core with a mass of 3.25 solar masses, and that 0.063 solar masses of strongly mixed 56Ni was synthesized.
doc	Homogeneous Liaison and the Sequentially Bounded Licci Property EOS In CI-Liaison, significant effort has been made to study ideals that are in the linkage class of a complete intersection, which are called licci ideals. EOS In a polynomial ring, recently E. EOS Chong defined a "sequentially bounded" condition on the degrees of the forms generating the regular sequences, and used this condition to find a large class of licci ideals satisfying the Eisenbud-Green-Harris Conjecture (among them, grade _EQN_ homogeneous Gorenstein ideals). EOS He raised the question of whether all homogeneous licci ideals are sequentially bounded licci.	In this paper we construct a class of examples that are homogeneously licci, but not sequentially bounded licci, thus answering his question in the negative.

EOS The concentration of TBABr is varied to alter the ion distribution.	Our x-ray measurements are inconsistent with several commonly used theories of ion distributions, including Gouy-Chapman, modified Verwey-Niessen, and the MPB5 version of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
doc	Einstein Gravity in Almost Kahler Variables and Stability of Gravity with Nonholonomic Distributions and Nonsymmetric Metrics EOS We argue that the Einstein gravity theory can be reformulated in almost Kahler (nonsymmetric) variables with effective symplectic form and compatible linear connection uniquely defined by a (pseudo) Riemannian metric.

Such systems require a fundamental understanding of the asymptotic behavior of key performance measures under various supply strategies, as well as the pre-planning of these strategies.
doc	Trying to understand the ridge effect in hydrodynamic model EOS In a recent paper, the hydrodynamic code NeXSPheRIO was used in conjunction with STAR analysis methods to study two-particle correlations as function of Delta_eta and Delta_phi. EOS Both the ridge-like near-side and the double-hump away-side structures were obtained. EOS However, the mechanism of ridge production was not clear. EOS In order to understand it, we study a simple model with only one high-energy density peripheral tube in a smooth cylindrical back-ground, with longitudinal boost invariance. EOS The results are rather surprising, but the model does produce the triple-ridge structure with one high ridge plus two lower ones placed symmetrically with respect to the former one.	The shape of this structure is rather stable in a wide range of parameters.
doc	Blazar variability power spectra from radio up to TeV photon energies: Mrk 421 and PKS 2155-304 EOS We present the results of the power spectral density (PSD) analysis for the blazars Mrk\,421 and PKS\,2155 _EQN_ 304, using good-quality, densely sampled light curves at multiple frequencies, covering 17 decades of the electromagnetic spectrum, and variability timescales from weeks up to a decade. EOS The data were collected from publicly available archives of observatories at radio from OVRO, optical and infrared (B, V, R, I, J, H, and K-bands), X-rays from the Swift and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, high and very high energy _EQN_ rays from the Fermi and Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System as well as the High Energy Stereoscopic System. EOS Our results are: (1) the power-law form of the variability power spectra at radio, infra-red and optical frequencies have slopes _EQN_ 1.8, indicative of random-walk type noise processes; EOS (2) the power-law form of the variability power spectra at higher frequencies, from X-rays to very high energy \, _EQN_ -rays, however, have slopes _EQN_ 1.2, suggesting a flicker noise type process;	(3) there is significantly more variability power at X-rays, high and very high energy _EQN_ -rays on timescales _EQN_ 100 days, as compared to lower energies.

doc	Near-Infrared Imaging of Early-Type Galaxies IV. The Physical Origins of the Fundamental Plane Scaling Relations EOS The physical origins of the Fundamental Plane (FP) scaling relations are investigated for early-type galaxies observed at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. EOS The slope for the FP is shown to increase systematically with wavelength from the U-band through the K-band. EOS A distance-independent construction of the observables is described which provides an accurate measurement of the change in the FP slope between any pair of bandpasses. EOS The variation of the FP slope with wavelength is strong evidence of systematic variations in stellar content along the elliptical galaxy sequence. EOS The intercept of the diagnostic relationship between log(D_K/D_V) and log(sigma_0) shows no significant dependence on environment within the uncertainties of the Galactic extinction corrections, demonstrating the universality of the stellar populations contributions at the level of Delta(V-K)=0.03 mag to the zero-point of the global scaling relations. EOS Several other constraints on the properties of early-type galaxies --- the slope of the Mg_2-sigma_0 relation, the effects of stellar populations gradients, and deviations of early-type galaxies from a dynamically homologous family --- are included to construct an empirical, self-consistent model which provides a complete picture of the underlying physical properties which are varying along the early-type galaxy sequence. EOS This empirical approach demonstrates that there are significant systematic variations in both age and metallicity along the elliptical galaxy sequence, and that a small, but systematic, breaking of dynamical homology (or a similar, wavelength independent effect) is required.	Predictions for the evolution of the slope of the FP with redshift are described.

doc	The Fundamental Theorem for weak braided bimonads EOS The theories of (Hopf) bialgebras and weak (Hopf) bialgebras have been introduced for vector space categories over fields and make heavily use of the tensor product. EOS As first generalisations, these notions were formulated for monoidal categories, with braidings if needed. EOS The present authors developed a theory of bimonads and Hopf monads _EQN_ on arbitrary categories _EQN_, employing distributive laws, allowing for a general form of the Fundamental Theorem for Hopf algebras. EOS For _EQN_ -bimonads _EQN_, properties of braided (Hopf) bialgebras were captured by requiring a Yang-Baxter operator _EQN_. EOS The purpose of this paper is to extend the features of weak (Hopf) bialgebras to this general setting including an appropriate form of the Fundamental Theorem.	This subsumes the theory of braided Hopf algebras (based on weak Yang-Baxter operators) as considered by Alonso \'Alvarez and others.
doc	Dynamic Response of Tunable Phononic Crystals and New Homogenization Approaches in Magnetoactive Composites EOS This research investigates dynamic response of tunable periodic structures and homogenization methods in magnetoelastic composites (MECs). EOS The research on tunable periodic structures is focused on the design, modeling and understanding of wave propagation phenomena and the dynamic response of smart phononic crystals. EOS High amplitude wrinkle formation is employed to study a one-dimensional phononic crystal slab consists of a thin film bonded to a thick compliant substrate. EOS Buckling induced surface instability generates a wrinkly structure triggered by a compressive strain. EOS It is demonstrated that surface periodic pattern and the corresponding large deformation can control elastic wave propagation in the low thickness composite slab. EOS Simulation results show that the periodic wrinkly structure can be used as a smart phononic crystal which can switch band diagrams of the structure in a transformative manner. EOS A magnetoactive phononic crystal is proposed which its dynamic properties are controlled by combined effects of large deformations and an applied magnetic field. EOS Finite deformations and magnetic induction influence phononic characteristics of the periodic structure through geometrical pattern transformation and material properties.	A magnetoelastic energy function is proposed to develop constitutive laws considering large deformations and magnetic induction in the periodic structure.

doc	Classical Gluon Production Amplitude for Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions: First Saturation Correction in the Projectile EOS We calculate the classical single-gluon production amplitude in nucleus-nucleus collisions including the first saturation correction in one of the nuclei (the projectile) while keeping multiple-rescattering (saturation) corrections to all orders in the other nucleus (the target). EOS In our approximation only two nucleons interact in the projectile nucleus: the single-gluon production amplitude we calculate is order-g^3 and is leading-order in the atomic number of the projectile, while resumming all order-one saturation corrections in the target nucleus.	Our result is the first step towards obtaining an analytic expression for the first projectile saturation correction to the gluon production cross section in nucleus-nucleus collisions.
doc	Ubiquitous velocity fluctuations throughout the molecular interstellar medium EOS The density structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) determines where stars form and release energy, momentum, and heavy elements, driving galaxy evolution. EOS Density variations are seeded and amplified by gas motion, but the exact nature of this motion is unknown across spatial scale and galactic environment. EOS Although dense star-forming gas likely emerges from a combination of instabilities, convergent flows, and turbulence, establishing the precise origin is challenging because it requires quantifying gas motion over many orders of magnitude in spatial scale. EOS Here we measure the motion of molecular gas in the Milky Way and in nearby galaxy NGC 4321, assembling observations that span an unprecedented spatial dynamic range (_EQN_ pc). EOS We detect ubiquitous velocity fluctuations across all spatial scales and galactic environments. EOS Statistical analysis of these fluctuations indicates how star-forming gas is assembled. EOS We discover oscillatory gas flows with wavelengths ranging from _EQN_ pc. EOS These flows are coupled to regularly-spaced density enhancements that likely form via gravitational instabilities. EOS We also identify stochastic and scale-free velocity and density fluctuations, consistent with the structure generated in turbulent flows. EOS Our results demonstrate that ISM structure cannot be considered in isolation.	Instead, its formation and evolution is controlled by nested, interdependent flows of matter covering many orders of magnitude in spatial scale.
doc	A Comparative Study of Neural Network Compression EOS There has recently been an increasing desire to evaluate neural networks locally on computationally-limited devices in order to exploit their recent effectiveness for several applications; EOS such effectiveness has nevertheless come together with a considerable increase in the size of modern neural networks, which constitute a major downside in several of the aforementioned computationally-limited settings. EOS There has thus been a demand of compression techniques for neural networks. EOS Several proposal in this direction have been made, which famously include hashing-based methods and pruning-based ones.	However, the evaluation of the efficacy of these techniques has so far been heterogeneous, with no clear evidence in favor of any of them over the others.
doc	Escape Room: A Configurable Testbed for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning EOS Recent successes in Reinforcement Learning have encouraged a fast-growing network of RL researchers and a number of breakthroughs in RL research. EOS As the RL community and the body of RL work grows, so does the need for widely applicable benchmarks that can fairly and effectively evaluate a variety of RL algorithms. EOS This need is particularly apparent in the realm of Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). EOS While many existing test domains may exhibit hierarchical action or state structures, modern RL algorithms still exhibit great difficulty in solving domains that necessitate hierarchical modeling and action planning, even when such domains are seemingly trivial. EOS These difficulties highlight both the need for more focus on HRL algorithms themselves, and the need for new testbeds that will encourage and validate HRL research. EOS Existing HRL testbeds exhibit a Goldilocks problem; EOS they are often either too simple (e.g. EOS Taxi) or too complex (e.g. EOS Montezuma's Revenge from the Arcade Learning Environment).	In this paper we present the Escape Room Domain (ERD), a new flexible, scalable, and fully implemented testing domain for HRL that bridges the "moderate complexity" gap left behind by existing alternatives.

doc	Improvements to Stellar Structure Models, Based on a Grid of 3D Convection Simulations. I. _EQN_ -Relations EOS Relations between temperature, T, and optical depth, tau, are often used for describing the photospheric transition from optically thick to optically thin in stellar structure models. EOS We show that this is well justified, but also that currently used T(tau) relations are often inconsistent with their implementation.	As an outer boundary condition on the system of stellar structure equations, T(tau) relations have an undue effect on the overall structure of stars.
doc	ASCA observations of the young rotation-powered pulsars PSR B1046-58 and PSR B1610-50 EOS We present X-ray observations of two young energetic radio pulsars, PSRs B1046-58 and B1610-50, and their surroundings, using archival data from the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA). EOS The energetic pulsar PSR B1046-58 is detected in X-rays with a significance of 4.5 sigma. EOS The unabsorbed flux, estimated assuming a power-law spectrum and a neutral hydrogen column density N_H of 5E21 cm^-2 is (2.5 +/- 0.3) x 10E-13 ergs/cm^2/s in the 2-10 keV band. EOS Pulsed emission is not detected; EOS the pulsed fraction is less than 31% at the 90% confidence level for a 50% duty cycle. EOS We argue that the emission is best explained as originating from a pulsar-powered synchrotron nebula. EOS The X-ray counterpart of the pulsar is the only hard source within the 95% error region of the previously unidentified gamma-ray source 3EG J1048-5840. EOS This evidence supports the results of Kaspi et al (1999), who in a companion paper, suggest that PSR B1046-58 is the counterpart to 3EG J1048-5840. EOS X-ray emission from PSR B1610-50 is not detected.	Using similar assumptions as above, the derived 3 sigma upper limit for the unabsorbed 2-10 keV X-ray flux is 1.5E-13 ergs/cm^2/s.

doc	Noncommutative gauge fields coupled to noncommutative gravity EOS We present a noncommutative (NC) version of the action for vielbein gravity coupled to gauge fields. EOS Noncommutativity is encoded in a twisted star product between forms, with a set of commuting background vector fields defining the (abelian) twist. EOS A first order action for the gauge fields avoids the use of the Hodge dual. EOS The NC action is invariant under diffeomorphisms and twisted gauge transformations. EOS The Seiberg-Witten map, adapted to our geometric setting and generalized for an arbitrary abelian twist, allows to re-express the NC action in terms of classical fields: the result is a deformed action, invariant under diffeomorphisms and usual gauge transformations. EOS This deformed action is a particular higher derivative extension of the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to Yang-Mills fields, and to the background vector fields defining the twist. EOS Here noncommutativity of the original NC action dictates the precise form of this extension.	We explicitly compute the first order correction in the NC parameter of the deformed action, and find that it is proportional to cubic products of the gauge field strength and to the symmetric anomaly tensor D_ IJK.

doc	Molecular switch controlled by pulsed bias voltages EOS It was observed in recent experiments that the current-voltage characteristics (IV) of BPDN-DT (bipyridyl- dinitro- oligophenylene- ethynylene- dithiol) can be switched in a very controlled manner between "on" and "off" traces by applying a pulse in a bias voltage, V_bias. EOS We have calculated the polaron formation energies to check a frequently held belief, namely, that the polaron formation can explain the observed bistability. EOS Our results are not consistent with such a mechanism.	Instead, we propose a conformational reorientation.

EOS We confirm 471 stars as members, based on their radial velocity and/or H-alpha emission. EOS The radial velocity distribution of cluster members is non-Gaussian with a dispersion of approx 3.5 km/s.	We find a substantial north-south velocity gradient and spatially coherent structure inthe radial velocity distribution, similar to that seen in the molecular gas in the region.
doc	A short review and primer on respiration in human computer interaction applications EOS The application of psychophysiology in human-computer interaction is a growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems. EOS Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of an array of physiological signals and analysis techniques. EOS Respiration is unique among physiological signals in that it can be consciously controlled which has to be taken into account when designing applications. EOS Respiration is tightly connected to other physiological signals, especially cardiovascular activity, and often analyzed in conjunction with other signals. EOS When analyzed separately, an increase in the rate of respiration can be seen as an increase in metabolic demand which indicates activate states such as engagement and attention. EOS We present a short review on the application of respiration in human-computer interaction.	This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid familiarisation with the latest core concepts.
doc	Three-body recombination near a narrow Feshbach resonance in _EQN_ Li EOS We experimentally measure, and theoretically analyze the three-atom recombination rate, _EQN_, around a narrow _EQN_ wave magnetic Feshbach resonance of _EQN_ Li- _EQN_ Li at 543.3 Gauss.	By examining both the magnetic field dependence and especially the temperature dependence of _EQN_ over a wide range of temperatures from a few _EQN_ K to above 200 _EQN_ K, we show that three-atom recombination through a narrow resonance follows a universal behavior determined by the long-range van der Waals potential, and can be described by a set of rate equations in which three-body recombination proceeds via successive pairwise interactions.
doc	High-Pressure Hydrogen Sulfide by Diffusion Quantum Monte Carlo EOS We use the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo to revisit the enthalpy-pressure phase diagram of the various products from the different proposed decompositions of H _EQN_ S at pressures above 150~GPa. EOS Our results entails a revision of the ground-state enthalpy-pressure phase diagram. EOS Specifically, we find that the C2/c HS _EQN_ structure is persistent up to 440~GPa before undergoing a phase transition into the C2/m phase. EOS Contrary to density functional theory, our calculations suggest that the C2/m phase of HS is more stable than the I4 _EQN_ /amd HS structure over the whole pressure range from 150 to 400 GPa.	Moreover, we predict that the Im-3m phase is the most likely candidate for H _EQN_ S, which is consistent with recent experimental x-ray diffraction measurements.
doc	On the 1-2-3-conjecture EOS A k-edge-weighting of a graph G is a function w: E(G)-> 1,2,...,k. EOS An edge-weighting naturally induces a vertex coloring c, where for every vertex v in V(G), c(v) is sum of weights of the edges that are adjacent to vertex v. EOS If the induced coloring c is a proper vertex coloring, then w is called a vertex-coloring k-edge weighting (VCk-EW). EOS Karonski et al (J. EOS Combin. EOS Theory Ser.

doc	Talk2Car: Taking Control of Your Self-Driving Car EOS A long-term goal of artificial intelligence is to have an agent execute commands communicated through natural language. EOS In many cases the commands are grounded in a visual environment shared by the human who gives the command and the agent. EOS Execution of the command then requires mapping the command into the physical visual space, after which the appropriate action can be taken. EOS In this paper we consider the former. EOS Or more specifically, we consider the problem in an autonomous driving setting, where a passenger requests an action that can be associated with an object found in a street scene. EOS Our work presents the Talk2Car dataset, which is the first object referral dataset that contains commands written in natural language for self-driving cars. EOS We provide a detailed comparison with related datasets such as ReferIt, RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, Cityscape-Ref and CLEVR-Ref.	Additionally, we include a performance analysis using strong state-of-the-art models.

The explicit expressions allow us to calculate the oscillator strength and the selection rules for electric dipole transitions between the Landau states.
doc	Local AGN Survey (LASr): I. Galaxy sample, infrared colour selection and predictions for AGN within 100 Mpc EOS In order to answer some of the major open questions in the fields of supermassive black hole (SMBH) and galaxy evolution, a complete census of SMBH growth, i.e., active galactic nuclei (AGN), is required. EOS Thanks to deep all-sky surveys, such as those by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) missions, this task is now becoming feasible in the nearby Universe. EOS Here, we present a new survey, the Local AGN Survey (LASr), with the goal of identifying AGN unbiased against obscuration and determining the intrinsic Compton-thick (CT) fraction. EOS First, we construct the most complete all-sky sample of galaxies within 100 Mpc from astronomical databases (90% completeness for log M_star/M_sun ~9.4), four times deeper than the current local galaxy reference, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey Redshift Survey (2MRS), which turns out to miss 20% of known luminous AGN. EOS These 49k galaxies serve as parent sample for LASr, called LASr-GPS. EOS It contains 4.3k already known AGN, >=82% of these are estimated to have L(12um) < 10^42.3 erg/s, i.e., are low-luminosity AGN. EOS As a first method for identifying Seyfert-like AGN, we use WISE-based infrared colours, finding 221 galaxies at L(12um) >= 10^42.3 erg/s to host an AGN at 90% reliability, This includes 61 new AGN candidates and implies and optical type 2 fraction of 50 to 71%. EOS We quantify the efficiency of this technique and estimate the total number of AGN with L_int(2-10 keV) >= 10^42 erg/s in the volume to be 362^+145_-116 (8.6^+3.5_-2.8 10^-5 Mpc^-3).	X-ray brightness estimates indicate the CT fraction to be 40-55% to explain the Swift non-detections of the infrared selected objects.
doc	Subgraphs of weakly quasi-random oriented graphs EOS It is an intriguing question to see what kind of information on the structure of an oriented graph _EQN_ one can obtain if _EQN_ does not contain a fixed oriented graph _EQN_ as a subgraph. EOS The related question in the unoriented case has been an active area of research, and is relatively well-understood in the theory of quasi-random graphs and extremal combinatorics. EOS In this paper, we consider the simplest cases of such a general question for oriented graphs, and provide some results on the global behavior of the orientation of _EQN_. EOS For the case that _EQN_ is an oriented four-cycle we prove: in every _EQN_ -free oriented graph _EQN_, there is a pair _EQN_ such that _EQN_ and _EQN_.	We give a random construction which shows that this bound on _EQN_ is best possible (up to the constant).

EOS We also report the first detection of the Pb II _EQN_ line in the interstellar medium (ISM) from an analysis of archival spectra acquired by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). EOS The oscillator strengths derived from our experimental lifetimes for Pb II _EQN_, _EQN_ are generally consistent with recent theoretical results, including our own relativistic calculations. EOS Our analysis of high-resolution HST/STIS spectra helps to confirm the relative strengths of the Pb II _EQN_, _EQN_ lines.	However, the oscillator strength that we obtain for Pb II _EQN_ (_EQN_) is significantly smaller than earlier theoretical values, which have been used to study the abundance of Pb in the ISM.

The analysis is based on the corresponding exact solution of Maxwell equations for the case of a single electron moving along the waveguide axis.

EOS We use a single linguistic phenomenon, negative polarity item (NPI) licensing in English, as a case study for our experiments.	NPIs like "any" are grammatical only if they appear in a licensing environment like negation ("Sue doesn't have any cats" vs.

EOS The formulation of inflation in the Ginsburg-Landau approach developed by de Vega and Sanchez  and by Boyanovsky, de Vega, Sanchez and Destri - clarifies and places inflation in the setting of the effective field theories of particle physics. EOS In addition, it sets up a clean way to directly confront the inflationary predictions with the available and forthcoming CMB data and select a definitive model. EOS All CMB + LSS data until now show how powerful is the Ginsburg-Landau effective theory of inflation in predicting observables in agreement with observations including the inflation energy scale and the inflaton potential, and which has much more to provide in the future.	It paves the way to discoveries, new learning and understanding.
doc	Assessment of certain higher-order structural models based on global approach for bending analysis of curvilinear composite laminates EOS In this paper, the performance of different structural models based on global approach in evaluating the static response of curvilinear fibre composite laminates is analyzed. EOS A Co shear flexible Quad-8 element developed based on higher-order structural theory is employed for the present study. EOS The structural theory accounting for the realistic variation of displacements through the thickness and the possible discontinuity in the slope at the interface is considered. EOS Four alternate discrete structural models, deduced from the generic structural model by retaining various terms in the displacement functions are examined for their applicability.

A systematic numerical study, assuming different ply-angle and lay-up, is conducted in bringing out the influence of various structural models on the static response of composite laminates with curvilinear fibres.

EOS From those expressions of anomalies, we construct covariant BRST and ghost number supercurrents in the effective theory.	We then show that the (super-)coordinate BRST current algebra forms a superfield extension of the topological conformal algebra for an arbitrary\/ type of conformal matter or, in terms of the string theory, for an arbitrary number of space-time dimensions.

EOS Feature engineering approaches require hand tuned features of the users history to be created to produce a context vector. EOS In contrast a session based approach is able to dynamically model the users state as they act. EOS We present a probabilistic framework for session based recommendation. EOS A latent variable for the user state is updated as the user views more items and we learn more about their interests. EOS The latent variable model is conceptually simple and elegant;	yet requires sophisticated computational technique to approximate the integral over the latent variable.

doc	Exclusive Meson Photo- and Electro-production, a Window on the Structure of Hadronic Matter EOS At high energy, exclusive meson photo- and electro-production give access to the structure of hadronic matter. EOS At low momentum transfers, the exchange of a few Regge trajectories leads to a comprehensive account of the cross-sections. EOS Among these trajectories, which are related to the mass spectrum of families of mesons, the Pomeron plays an interesting role as it is related to glue-ball excitations. EOS At high momentum transfers, the exchange of these collective excitations is expected to reduce to the exchange of their simplest (quark or gluon) components. EOS However, contributions from unitarity rescattering cuts are relevant even at high energies. EOS In the JLab energy range, the asymptotic regime, where the players in the game are current quarks and massless gluons has not been reached yet.	One has to rely on more effective degrees of freedom adapted to the scale of the probe.

doc	Machine Learning for Mathematical Software EOS While there has been some discussion on how Symbolic Computation could be used for AI there is little literature on applications in the other direction. EOS However, recent results for quantifier elimination suggest that, given enough example problems, there is scope for machine learning tools like Support Vector Machines to improve the performance of Computer Algebra Systems. EOS We survey the authors own work and similar applications for other mathematical software. EOS It may seem that the inherently probabilistic nature of machine learning tools would invalidate the exact results prized by mathematical software.	However, algorithms and implementations often come with a range of choices which have no effect on the mathematical correctness of the end result but a great effect on the resources required to find it, and thus here, machine learning can have a significant impact.

doc	3D numerical simulations of photodissociated and photoionized disks EOS In this work we study the influence of the UV radiation field of a massive star on the evolution of a disklike mass of gas and dust around a nearby star. EOS This system has similarities with the Orion proplyds. EOS We study disks with different inclinations and distances from the source, performing 3D numerical simulations. EOS We use the YGUAZ\'U-A adaptative grid code modified to account for EUV/FUV fluxes and non-spherical mass distributions. EOS We treat H and C photoionization to reproduce the ionization fronts and photodissociation regions observed in proplyds. EOS We also incorporate a wind from the ionizing source, to investigate the formation of the bow shock observed in several proplyds. EOS Our results show that a photoevaporated wind propagates from the disk surface and becomes ionized after an ionization front (IF) seen as a bright peak in Ha maps. EOS We follow the development of an HI region inside the photoevaporated wind which corresponds to a photodissociated region (PDR) for most of our models, except those without a FUV flux. EOS For disks that are at a distance from the source d \geq 0.1 pc, the PDR is thick and the IF is detached from the disk surface. EOS In contrast, for disks that are closer to the source, the PDR is thin and not resolved in our simulations. EOS The IF then coincides with the first grid points of the disk that are facing the ionizing photon source.	In both cases, the photoevaporated wind shocks (after the IF) with the wind that comes from the ionizing source, and this interaction region is bright in Ha.

EOS We discovered six new EIGs in addition to five known EIGs. EOS We also found that the Halpha tail from the blue infalling group (BIG) is extended to about 330 kpc in projected distance, which is about twice longer than previously reported. EOS Candidates of star-forming blobs in the tail are detected. EOS The properties of the EIG parent galaxies in Abell 1367 basically resemble those in the Coma cluster. EOS A noticeable difference is that the number of detached EIGs is significantly fewer in Abell 1367, while the fraction of blue member galaxies is higher.	The results suggest a difference in the evolutionary stage of the clusters;

doc	Nonparametric learning for impulse control problems EOS One of the fundamental assumptions in stochastic control of continuous time processes is that the dynamics of the underlying (diffusion) process is known. EOS This is, however, usually obviously not fulfilled in practice. EOS On the other hand, over the last decades, a rich theory for nonparametric estimation of the drift (and volatility) for continuous time processes has been developed. EOS The aim of this paper is bringing together techniques from stochastic control with methods from statistics for stochastic processes to find a way to both learn the dynamics of the underlying process and control in a reasonable way at the same time.	More precisely, we study a long-term average impulse control problem, a stochastic version of the classical Faustmann timber harvesting problem.

EOS We report on the analysis of an XMM observation of such a source IGR J16320-4751 = AX J1631.9-4752. EOS Our analysis allowed us to obtain the most accurate X-ray position to date (Rodriguez et al 2003), and to identify a likely infrared counterpart (Tomsick et al 2003). EOS We present the detailed analysis of the IGR J1632-4751 XMM spectra.

doc	Superconducting Correlations in the One-Dimensional Kondo Lattice Models under Magnetic Fields EOS We analyze superconducting correlations in the one-dimensional Kondo lattice models with Ising anisotropy under transverse magnetic fields, using the density matrix renormalization group. EOS For the spin-1/2 local spin model, the Ising anisotropy is introduced by the ferromagnetic Ising interaction between the local spins, while for the spin-1 model, it is taken by the single-ion anisotropy. EOS The magnetic properties under the transverse fields for the spin-1/2 model are very similar to those for the spin-1 model [K. EOS Suzuki and K. EOS Hattori, J. EOS Phys. EOS Soc. EOS Jpn. EOS 88, 024707 (2019).]. EOS For the superconducting correlations, we analyze various Cooper pairs within nearest-neighbor pairs including composite ones between the local spins and the electrons. EOS We find that, for the spin-1/2 model, the superconducting correlations are highly enhanced in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state near the Kondo-plateau phase, where the conduction electrons and the local spins are strongly coupled with a finite spin gap for the Ising axis. EOS This is a clear contrast to the model under the longitudinal magnetic fields, where there are no noticeable superconducting correlations. EOS Competitions between the transverse magnetic field and the Kondo singlet formation lead to this enhanced superconducting correlations. EOS For the spin-1 model, the single-ion anisotropy suppresses the superconducting correlation and there is no noticeable enhancement. EOS We also examine the large Kondo exchange coupling limit. EOS For the moderate ferromagnetic Ising interaction between the local spins, we find that another type of superconducting correlation is enhanced inside the ferromagnetic phase.	We discuss a possible relation between our results and reentrant superconductivity in U-based ferromagnetic superconductors under transverse magnetic fields.

EOS Average stellar orbits of the Galactic disk may have some small intrinsic ellipticity which breaks the exact axisymmetry and there may also be some migration of stars inwards or outwards.

doc	Symmetry and its breaking in path integral approach to quantum Brownian motion EOS We study the Caldeira-Leggett model where a quantum Brownian particle interacts with an environment or a bath consisting of a collection of harmonic oscillators in the path integral formalism. EOS Compared to the contours that the paths take in the conventional Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, the paths in our study are deformed in the complex time plane as suggested by the recent study [C. EOS Aron, G. EOS Biroli and L. EOS F. EOS Cugliandolo, SciPost Phys.\ 4, 008 (2018)]. EOS This is done to investigate the connection between the symmetry properties in the Schwinger-Keldysh action and the equilibrium or non-equilibrium nature of the dynamics in an open quantum system. EOS We derive the influence functional explicitly in this setting, which captures the effect of the coupling to the bath. EOS We show that in equilibrium the action and the influence functional are invariant under a set of transformations of path integral variables.	The fluctuation-dissipation relation is obtained as a consequence of this symmetry.
doc	Collinear-to-Spiral Spin Transformation without Changing Modulation Wavelength upon Ferroelectric Transition in Tb1-xDyxMnO3 EOS Lattice modulation and magnetic structures in magnetoelectric compounds Tb1-xDyxMnO3 have been studied around the ferroelectric (FE) Curie temperature T_C by x-ray and neutron diffraction. EOS Temperature-independent modulation vectors through T_C are observed for the compounds with 0.50< x < 0.68. EOS This indicates that ferroelectricity with a polarization (P) along the c axis in the RMnO3 series cannot be ascribed to such an incommensurate-commensurate transition of an antiferromagnetic order as was previously anticipated.	Neutron diffraction study of a single crystal with x=0.59 shows that the FE transition is accompanied by the transformation of the Mn-spin alignment from sinusoidal (collinear) antiferromagnetism into a transverse spiral structure.

doc	Effect of Epitaxial Strain on Phase Separation in Thin Films EOS We examine the role of an imposed epitaxial strain e in enhancing or depressing the spinodal instability of an alloy thin film. EOS Since the alloy film starts with an imposed strain, phase separation offers a mechanism to relieve it, but only when the film is elastically inhomogeneous. EOS With composition-dependence of elastic modulus given by y, and that of lattice parameter by \eta, our simulations using the Cahn-Hilliard model show (and analytical results for early stages confirm) that, for (ey/ \eta) > 0, the imposed strain adds to the driving force for phase separation, decreases the maximally growing wave length, and expands the coherent spinodal in the phase diagram. EOS Further, when (ey/ \eta) > 0.372, it expands to even outside of chemical spinodal. EOS Phase separation produces islands of elastically softer (harder) phase with (without) a favorable imposed strain.	These results are in agreement with experimental results in GeSi thin films on Si and Ge substrates, as well as in InGaAs films on GaAs substrates.
doc	Modelling income, wealth, and expenditure data by use of Econophysics EOS In the present paper, we identify several distributions from Physics and study their applicability to phenomena such as distribution of income, wealth, and expenditure. EOS Firstly, we apply logistic distribution to these data and we find that it fits very well the annual data for the entire income interval including for upper income segment of population. EOS Secondly, we apply Fermi-Dirac distribution to these data. EOS We seek to explain possible correlations and analogies between economic systems and statistical thermodynamics systems. EOS We try to explain their behavior and properties when we correlate physical variables with macroeconomic aggregates and indicators. EOS Then we draw some analogies between parameters of the Fermi-Dirac distribution and macroeconomic variables. EOS Thirdly, as complex systems are modeled using polynomial distributions, we apply polynomials to the annual sets of data and we find that it fits very well also the entire income interval. EOS Fourthly, we develop a new methodology to approach dynamically the income, wealth, and expenditure distribution similarly with dynamical complex systems. EOS This methodology was applied to different time intervals consisting of consecutive years up to 35 years. EOS Finally, we develop a mathematical model based on a Hamiltonian that maximizes utility function applied to Ramsey model using Fermi-Dirac and polynomial utility functions.	We find some theoretical connections with time preference theory.
doc	Low-Complexity Multiuser QAM Detection for Uplink 1-bit Massive MIMO EOS This work studies multiuser detection for one-bit massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems in order to diminish the power consumption at the base station (BS). EOS A low-complexity near-maximum-likelihood (nML) multiuser detection algorithm is designed, assuming that each BS antenna port is connected with a pair of single-bit resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and each user equipment (UE) transmits symbols from a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) constellation.	First, a novel convex program is formulated as a convex surrogate of the ML detector and subsequently solved through an accelerated first-order method.
doc	X-ray monitoring of classical novae in the central region of M31. III. Autumn and winter 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12 EOS [Abridged] Classical novae (CNe) represent the major class of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) in the central region of our neighbouring galaxy M31. EOS We performed a dedicated monitoring of the M31 central region, aimed to detect SSS counterparts of CNe, with XMM-Newton and Chandra between Nov and Mar of the years 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12. EOS In total we detected 24 novae in X-rays.	Seven of these sources were known from previous observations, including the M31 nova with the longest SSS phase, M31N~1996-08b, which was found to fade below our X-ray detection limit 13.8 yr after outburst.
doc	Computing the Top Betti Numbers of Semi-algebraic Sets Defined by Quadratic Inequalities in Polynomial Time EOS For any _EQN_, we present an algorithm which takes as input a semi-algebraic set, _EQN_, defined by _EQN_, where each _EQN_ has degree _EQN_ and computes the top _EQN_ Betti numbers of _EQN_, _EQN_ in polynomial time. EOS The complexity of the algorithm, stated more precisely, is _EQN_ For fixed _EQN_, the complexity of the algorithm can be expressed as _EQN_ which is polynomial in the input parameters _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS To our knowledge this is the first polynomial time algorithm for computing non-trivial topological invariants of semi-algebraic sets in _EQN_ defined by polynomial inequalities, where the number of inequalities is not fixed and the polynomials are allowed to have degree greater than one.	For fixed _EQN_, we obtain by letting _EQN_, an algorithm for computing all the Betti numbers of _EQN_ whose complexity is _EQN_.
doc	Modeling tagged pedestrian motion: a mean-field type game approach EOS This paper suggests a model for the motion of tagged pedestrians: pedestrians moving towards a specified targeted destination, which they are forced to reach. EOS It aims to be a decision-making tool for the positioning of fire fighters, security personnel, and other services in a pedestrian environment. EOS Taking interaction with the surrounding crowd into account leads to a differential nonzero-sum game model where the tagged pedestrians compete with the surrounding crowd of ordinary pedestrians. EOS When deciding how to act, pedestrians consider crowd distribution-dependent effects, like congestion and crowd aversion. EOS Including such effects in the parameters of the game, makes it a mean-field type game.	The equilibrium control is characterized, and special cases are discussed.
doc	Spectral Classification and Ionized Gas Outflows in _EQN_ WISE-Selected Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies EOS We present VLT/XSHOOTER rest-frame UV-optical spectra of 10 Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) at _EQN_ to investigate AGN diagnostics and to assess the presence and effect of ionized gas outflows. EOS Most Hot DOGs in this sample are narrow-line dominated AGN (type 1.8 or higher), and have higher Balmer decrements than typical type 2 quasars. EOS Almost all (8/9) sources show evidence for ionized gas outflows in the form of broad and blueshifted [O III] profiles, and some sources have such profiles in H _EQN_ (5/7) or [O II] (3/6). EOS Combined with the literature, these results support additional sources of obscuration beyond the simple torus invoked by AGN unification models.	Outflow rates derived from the broad [O III] line (_EQN_) are greater than the black hole accretion and star formation rates, with feedback efficiencies (_EQN_) consistent with negative feedback to the host galaxy's star formation in merger-driven quasar activity scenarios.
doc	Infrared study of lattice dynamics and spin-phonon and electron-phonon interactions in multiferroic TbFe3(BO3)4 and GdFe3(BO3)4 EOS We present a comparative far-infrared reflection spectroscopy study of phonons, phase transitions, spin-phonon and electron-phonon interactions in isostructural multiferroic iron borates of gadolinium and terbium. EOS The behavior of phonon modes registered in a wide temperature range is consistent with a weak first-order structural phase transition (Ts = 143 for GdFe3(BO3)4 and 200 K for TbFe3(BO3)4) from high-symmetry high-temperature R32 structure into low-symmetry low-temperature P3121 one.	The temperature dependences of frequencies, oscillator strengths, and damping constants of some low-frequency modes reveal an appreciable lattice anharmonicity.

doc	Hard X-ray Flares Preceding Soft X-ray Outbursts in Aquila X-1: A Link between Neutron Star and Black Hole State Transitions EOS We have analyzed Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data of the neutron star transient Aquila X-1 obtained during its outbursts in May/June 1999 and September/October 2000. EOS We find that in the early rise of these outbursts, a hard flare in the energy range above 15 keV preceded the soft X-ray peak. EOS The hard X-ray flux of the hard flares at maximum was more than a factor of three stronger than at any other point in the outbursts. EOS The rise of the hard X-ray flare to this maximum, was consistent with a monotonically brightening low/hard state spectrum.	After the peak of the hard flare, a sharp spectral transition occurred with spectral pivoting in the range 8--12 keV.
doc	V 3 _EQN_ charge and orbital states in V _EQN_ OPO _EQN_ probed by x-ray absorption spectroscopy EOS V 3 _EQN_ charge and orbital states in V _EQN_ OPO _EQN_ have been investigated by means of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). EOS The electronic structure of V _EQN_ OPO _EQN_ is very unique in that the charge transfer between V _EQN_ and V _EQN_ in face sharing VO _EQN_ chains provides negative thermal expansion as reported by Pachoud et al [J. EOS Am. EOS Chem. EOS Soc. EOS 140, 636 (2018).] The near edge region of O 1 _EQN_ XAS exhibits the three features which can be assigned to transitions to O 2 _EQN_ mixed into the unoccupied V 3 _EQN_ _EQN_ and _EQN_ orbitals of V _EQN_ and V _EQN_. EOS The V 2 _EQN_ XAS line shape can be reproduced by multiplet calculations for a mixed valence state with V _EQN_ and V _EQN_. EOS The polarization dependence of the O 1 _EQN_ and V 2 _EQN_ XAS spectra indicates V 3 _EQN_ orbital order in which _EQN_ and _EQN_ (or _EQN_) orbitals are occupied at the V _EQN_ site in the face sharing chains.	The occupied _EQN_ orbital is essential for the antiferromagnetic coupling between the V _EQN_ and V _EQN_ sites along the chains while the occupied _EQN_ (or _EQN_) orbital provides the antiferromagnetic coupling between the V _EQN_ and V _EQN_ sites between the chains.
doc	Modeling Survival in model-based Reinforcement Learning EOS Although recent model-free reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to be capable of mastering complicated decision-making tasks, the sample complexity of these methods has remained a hurdle to utilizing them in many real-world applications. EOS In this regard, model-based reinforcement learning proposes some remedies. EOS Yet, inherently, model-based methods are more computationally expensive and susceptible to sub-optimality. EOS One reason is that model-generated data are always less accurate than real data, and this often leads to inaccurate transition and reward function models. EOS With the aim to mitigate this problem, this work presents the notion of survival by discussing cases in which the agent's goal is to survive and its analogy to maximizing the expected rewards. EOS To that end, a substitute model for the reward function approximator is introduced that learns to avoid terminal states rather than to maximize accumulated rewards from safe states. EOS Focusing on terminal states, as a small fraction of state-space, reduces the training effort drastically.	Next, a model-based reinforcement learning method is proposed (Survive) to train an agent to avoid dangerous states through a safety map model built upon temporal credit assignment in the vicinity of terminal states.

doc	High Energy Neutrino Flashes from Far-Ultraviolet and X-ray Flares in Gamma-Ray Bursts EOS The recent observations of bright optical and x-ray flares by the Swift satellite suggest these are produced by the late activities of the central engine. EOS We study the neutrino emission from far-ultraviolet and x-ray flares under the late internal shock model. EOS We show that the efficiency of pion production in the highest energy is comparable to or higher than the unity, and the contribution from such neutrino flashes to a diffuse very high energy neutrino background can be larger than that of prompt bursts if the total baryonic energy input into flares is comparable to the radiated energy of prompt bursts.	These signals may be detected by IceCube and are very important because they have possibilities to probe the nature of flares (the baryon loading, the photon field, the magnetic field and so on).

doc	Null Geodesics in Five Dimensional Manifolds EOS We analyze a class of 5D non-compact warped-product spaces characterized by metrics that depend on the extra coordinate via a conformal factor. EOS Our model is closely related to the so-called canonical coordinate gauge of Mashhoon et al We confirm that if the 5D manifold in our model is Ricci-flat, then there is an induced cosmological constant in the 4D sub-manifold. EOS We derive the general form of the 5D Killing vectors and relate them to the 4D Killing vectors of the embedded spacetime. EOS We then study the 5D null geodesic paths and show that the 4D part of the motion can be timelike -- that is, massless particles in 5D can be massive in 4D.	We find that if the null trajectories are affinely parameterized in 5D, then the particle is subject to an anomalous acceleration or fifth force.

The spectral function of the amplitude response is obtained by analytic continuation of the kinetic energy correlation function calculated by Monte Carlo methods.

doc	Atmospheric and Astrophysical Neutrinos above 1 TeV Interacting in IceCube EOS The IceCube Neutrino Observatory was designed primarily to search for high-energy (TeV--PeV) neutrinos produced in distant astrophysical objects. EOS A search for _EQN_ ~TeV neutrinos interacting inside the instrumented volume has recently provided evidence for an isotropic flux of such neutrinos. EOS At lower energies, IceCube collects large numbers of neutrinos from the weak decays of mesons in cosmic-ray air showers.	Here we present the results of a search for neutrino interactions inside IceCube's instrumented volume between 1~TeV and 1~PeV in 641 days of data taken from 2010--2012, lowering the energy threshold for neutrinos from the southern sky below 10 TeV for the first time, far below the threshold of the previous high-energy analysis.
doc	Controlling charge quantization with quantum fluctuations EOS In 1909, Millikan showed that the charge of electrically isolated systems is quantized in units of the elementary electron charge e. EOS Today, the persistence of charge quantization in small, weakly connected conductors allows for circuits where single electrons are manipulated, with applications in e.g. EOS metrology, detectors and thermometry. EOS However, quantum fluctuations progressively reduce the discreteness of charge as the connection strength is increased. EOS Here we report on the full quantum control and characterization of charge quantization. EOS By using semiconductor-based tunable elemental conduction channels to connect a micrometer-scale metallic island, the complete evolution is explored while scanning the entire range of connection strengths, from tunnel barrier to ballistic contact. EOS We observe a robust scaling of charge quantization as the square root of the residual electron reflection probability across a quantum channel when approaching the ballistic critical point, which also applies beyond the regimes yet accessible to theory.	At increased temperatures, the thermal fluctuations result in an exponential suppression of charge quantization as well as in a universal square root scaling, for arbitrary connection strengths, in agreement with expectations.

EOS Increase in the use of DOIs will prepare the discipline for changing expectations among funding agencies and publishers, who increasingly expect accurate and thorough data citation to accompany scientific outputs. EOS The use of DOIs ensures a robust, sustainable, and interoperable approach to data citation in which due credit is given to researchers and institutions who produce and maintain the primary data.	We describe in this work the advantages of DOIs for data citation and best practices for integrating a DOI service in an astronomical archive.
doc	StreamChain: Rethinking Blockchain for Datacenters EOS Permissioned blockchains promise secure decentralized data management in business-to-business use-cases. EOS In contrast to Bitcoin and similar public blockchains which rely on Proof-of-Work for consensus and are deployed on thousands of geo-distributed nodes, business-to-business use-cases (such as supply chain management and banking) require significantly fewer nodes, cheaper consensus, and are often deployed in datacenter-like environments with fast networking. EOS However, permissioned blockchains often follow the architectural thinkining behind their WAN-oriented public relatives, which results in end-to-end latencies several orders of magnitude higher than necessary.	In this work, we propose StreamChain, a permissioned blockchain design that eliminates blocks in favor of processing transactions in a streaming fashion.

EOS Similar rain patterns are visible in a rain image as well as its multi-scale (or multi-resolution) versions, which makes it possible to exploit such complementary information for rain streak representation.	In this work, we explore the multi-scale collaborative representation for rain streaks from the perspective of input image scales and hierarchical deep features in a unified framework, termed multi-scale progressive fusion network (MSPFN) for single image rain streak removal.
doc	Antiferromagnetic order and domains in Sr3Ir2O7 probed by x-ray resonant scattering EOS This article reports a detailed x-ray resonant scattering study of the bilayer iridate compound, Sr3Ir2O7, at the Ir L2 and L3 edges. EOS Resonant scattering at the Ir L3 edge has been used to determine that Sr3Ir2O7 is a long-range ordered antiferromagnet below TN 230K with an ordering wavevector, q=(1/2,1/2,0). EOS The energy resonance at the L3 edge was found to be a factor of ~30 times larger than that at the L2. EOS This remarkable effect has been seen in the single layer compound Sr2IrO4 and has been linked to the observation of a Jeff=1/2 spin-orbit insulator. EOS Our result shows that despite the modified electronic structure of the bilayer compound, caused by the larger bandwidth, the effect of strong spin-orbit coupling on the resonant magnetic scattering persists.	Using the programme SARAh, we have determined that the magnetic order consists of two domains with propagation vectors k1=(1/2,1/2,0) and k2=(1/2,-1/2,0), respectively.

EOS All the gamma cascades, which correspond to the decays from the compound state to 12 final levels of 0 (_EQN_), 7.535 (_EQN_), 35.844 (_EQN_), 90.875 (_EQN_), 126.412 (_EQN_), 127.298 (_EQN_), 182.902 (_EQN_), 321.113 (_EQN_), 404.129 (_EQN_), 405.470 (_EQN_), 414.924 (_EQN_), and 481.088 (_EQN_) keV, have been measured. EOS A total number of 386 cascades corresponding to 576 gamma transitions has been detected. EOS Among these cascades, 103 primary gamma transitions together with their corresponding intermediate levels and 299 secondary transitions have been determined. EOS In addition, 29 primary gamma transitions, 42 intermediate levels, and 8 secondary transitions have been found to be the same as those extracted from the ENSDF data.	The remain 74 primary gamma transitions, 61 intermediate levels, and 291 secondary transitions are therefore considered as the new data.
doc	Low-Temperature Properties of Ferromagnetic Spin Chains in a Magnetic Field EOS The thermodynamic properties of ferromagnetic spin chains have been analyzed with a variety of microscopic methods over the years: Bethe ansatz, spin-wave theory, Schwinger-boson mean-field theory, Green functions and renormalization group methods. EOS Surprisingly, in all these different studies, to the best of our knowledge, the manifestation of the spin-wave interaction in the low-temperature series for the thermodynamic quantities has been ignored. EOS In the present work, we address this problem by following a different path, based on the systematic effective Lagrangian method. EOS We evaluate the partition function up to two-loop order and derive the low-temperature expansion of the energy density, entropy density, heat capacity, magnetization and susceptibility in the presence of a weak external magnetic field. EOS Remarkably, the spin-wave interaction only manifests itself beyond two-loop order.	In particular, there is no term of order _EQN_ in the low-temperature series of the free energy density.

doc	New activity pattern in human interactive dynamics EOS We investigate the response function of human agents as demonstrated by written correspondence, uncovering a new universal pattern for how the reactive dynamics of individuals is distributed across the set of each agent's contacts. EOS In long-term empirical data on email, we find that the set of response times considered separately for the messages to each different correspondent of a given writer, generate a family of heavy-tailed distributions, which have largely the same features for all agents, and whose characteristic times grow exponentially with the rank of each correspondent. EOS We furthermore show that this universal behavioral pattern emerges robustly by considering weighted moving averages of the priority-conditioned response-time probabilities generated by a basic prioritization model.	Our findings clarify how the range of priorities in the inputs from one's environment underpin and shape the dynamics of agents embedded in a net of reactive relations.
doc	Evaluation of linear classifiers on articles containing pharmacokinetic evidence of drug-drug interactions EOS Background. EOS Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. EOS [...] Biomedical literature mining can aid DDI research by extracting relevant DDI signals from either the published literature or large clinical databases. EOS However, though drug interaction is an ideal area for translational research, the inclusion of literature mining methodologies in DDI workflows is still very preliminary. EOS One area that can benefit from literature mining is the automatic identification of a large number of potential DDIs, whose pharmacological mechanisms and clinical significance can then be studied via in vitro pharmacology and in populo pharmaco-epidemiology. EOS Experiments. EOS We implemented a set of classifiers for identifying published articles relevant to experimental pharmacokinetic DDI evidence. EOS These documents are important for identifying causal mechanisms behind putative drug-drug interactions, an important step in the extraction of large numbers of potential DDIs. EOS We evaluate performance of several linear classifiers on PubMed abstracts, under different feature transformation and dimensionality reduction methods. EOS In addition, we investigate the performance benefits of including various publicly-available named entity recognition features, as well as a set of internally-developed pharmacokinetic dictionaries.

EOS On the other hand, Toffoli gate is a universal and well-known quantum gate. EOS It is frequently used in synthesis of quantum circuits. EOS In this paper, a general protocol for implementing a remote n-qubit controlled-U gate is presented with minimum required resources. EOS Then, the proposed method is applied for implementing a Toffoli gate in bipartite and tripartite systems. EOS This method also is optimal when group of the qubits belong to one part, section or subsystem of network.	Because it only use one entangled qubit for each group of the qubits in mentioned conditions.
doc	On the critical exponents of the yielding transition of amorphous solids EOS We investigate numerically the yielding transition of a two dimensional model amorphous solid under external shear. EOS We use a scalar model in terms of values of the total local strain, that we derive from the full (tensorial) description of the elastic interactions in the system, in which plastic deformations are accounted for by introducing a stochastic "plastic disorder" potential. EOS This scalar model is seen to be equivalent to a collection of Prandtl-Tomlinson particles, which are coupled through an Eshelby quadrupolar kernel. EOS Numerical simulations of this scalar model reveal that the strain rate vs stress curve, close to the critical stress, is of the form _EQN_. EOS Remarkably, we find that the value of _EQN_ depends on details of the microscopic plastic potential used, confirming and giving additional support to results previously obtained with the full tensorial model. EOS % REF. EOS To rationalize this result, we argue that the Eshelby interaction in the scalar model can be treated to a good approximation in a sort of "dynamical" mean field, which corresponds to a Prandtl-Tomlinson particle that is driven by the applied strain rate in the presence of a stochastic noise generated by all other particles.	The dynamics of this Prandtl-Tomlinson particle displays different values of the _EQN_ exponent depending on the analytical properties of the microscopic potential, thus giving support to the results of the numerical simulations.

Six extractions of this type were made and the resultant solar neutrino capture rate was 64 ^ +24 _ -22 SNU, which agrees well with the overall result of the gallium experiments.
doc	Classical Gravity Coupled to Liouville Theory EOS We consider the two dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim model of gravity. EOS We first couple the model to the Liouville action and _EQN_ scalar fields and show, treating the combined system as a non linear sigma model, that the resulting theory can be interpreted as a critical string moving in a target space of dimension _EQN_. EOS We then analyse perturbatively a generalised model containing a kinetic term and an arbitrary potential for the auxiliary field. EOS We use the background field method and work with covariant gauges. EOS We show that the renormalisability of the theory depends on the form of the potential. EOS For a general potential, the theory can be renormalised as a non linear sigma model.	In the particular case of a Liouville-like potential, the theory is renormalisable in the usual sense.
doc	Tate tame symbol and the joint torsion of commuting operators EOS We investigate determinants of Koszul complexes of holomorphic functions of a commuting tuple of bounded operators acting on a Hilbert space. EOS Our main result shows that the analytic joint torsion, which compares two such determinants, can be computed by a local formula which involves a tame symbol of the involved holomorphic functions. EOS As an application we are able to extend the classical tame symbol of meromorphic functions on a Riemann surface to the more involved setting of transversal functions on a complex analytic curve.	This follows by spelling out our main result in the case of Toeplitz operators acting on the Hardy space over the polydisc.

The main emphasis is laid on the largely unexplored and particularly challenging case that one energy level exhibits a much larger population than all the others.

EOS These problems may be solved by using the recently proposed SUSY breaking models in a conformal window of the vector-like _EQN_ gauge theory with gauge singlets. EOS In this paper we propose a model of gauge mediation based on the SUSY-breaking model in the conformal window, and study the dynamics for the SUSY breaking. EOS In the model, there are massive vector-like bifundamental fields charged under both _EQN_ and the standard model gauge group, and our model can be regarded as a semi-direct gauge mediation model.	The color number _EQN_ can be small to avoid the Landau pole problem, and the R symmetry is also broken under a reasonable assumption on the strong dynamics of the model.
doc	Surrogate Model Assisted Cooperative Coevolution for Large Scale Optimization EOS It has been shown that cooperative coevolution (CC) can effectively deal with large scale optimization problems (LSOPs) through a divide-and-conquer strategy. EOS However, its performance is severely restricted by the current context-vector-based sub-solution evaluation method since this method needs to access the original high dimensional simulation model when evaluating each sub-solution and thus requires many computation resources. EOS To alleviate this issue, this study proposes a novel surrogate model assisted cooperative coevolution (SACC) framework. EOS SACC constructs a surrogate model for each sub-problem obtained via decomposition and employs it to evaluate corresponding sub-solutions.	The original simulation model is only adopted to reevaluate some good sub-solutions selected by surrogate models, and these real evaluated sub-solutions will be in turn employed to update surrogate models.

doc	Planck 2015 results. XV. Gravitational lensing EOS We present the most significant measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing potential to date (at a level of 40 sigma), using temperature and polarization data from the Planck 2015 full-mission release. EOS Using a polarization-only estimator we detect lensing at a significance of 5 sigma. EOS We cross-check the accuracy of our measurement using the wide frequency coverage and complementarity of the temperature and polarization measurements. EOS Public products based on this measurement include an estimate of the lensing potential over approximately 70% of the sky, an estimate of the lensing potential power spectrum in bandpowers for the multipole range 40<L<400 and an associated likelihood for cosmological parameter constraints. EOS We find good agreement between our measurement of the lensing potential power spectrum and that found in the best-fitting LCDM model based on the Planck temperature and polarization power spectra. EOS Using the lensing likelihood alone we obtain a percent-level measurement of the parameter combination _EQN_.	We combine our determination of the lensing potential with the E-mode polarization also measured by Planck to generate an estimate of the lensing B-mode.
doc	Strictly ergodic models and the convergence of non-conventional pointwise ergodic averages EOS The well-known Jewett-Krieger's Theorem states that each ergodic system has a strictly ergodic model. EOS Strengthening the model by requiring that it is strictly ergodic under some group actions, and building the connection of the new model with the convergence of pointwise non-conventional ergodic averages we prove that for an ergodic system _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, %and any tempered F \rm _EQN_ lner sequence _EQN_ of _EQN_, the averages \begin equation* \frac 1 N^2 \sum_ (n,m)\in F_N f_1(T^nx)f_2(T^ n+m x)\ldots f_d(T^ n+(d-1)m x) \end equation* converge _EQN_ a.e.	We remark that the same method can be used to show the pointwise convergence of ergodic averages along cubes which was firstly proved by Assani and then extended to a general case by Chu and Franzikinakis.
doc	Contribution of Bright Extragalactic Radio Sources to Microwave Anisotropy EOS We estimate the contribution of extragalactic radio sources to fluctuations in sky temperature over the range of frequencies (10-300 GHz) used for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements.

We have compiled a catalog of 2207 bright radio sources, including 758 sources with flux measurements at 90 GHz.
doc	LoCUS: A multi-robot loss-tolerant algorithm for surveying volcanic plumes EOS Measurement of volcanic CO2 flux by a drone swarm poses special challenges. EOS Drones must be able to follow gas concentration gradients while tolerating frequent drone loss. EOS We present the LoCUS algorithm as a solution to this problem and prove its robustness. EOS LoCUS relies on swarm coordination and self-healing to solve the task. EOS As a point of contrast we also implement the MoBS algorithm, derived from previously published work, which allows drones to solve the task independently. EOS We compare the effectiveness of these algorithms using drone simulations, and find that LoCUS provides a reliable and efficient solution to the volcano survey problem.	Further, the novel data-structures and algorithms underpinning LoCUS have application in other areas of fault-tolerant algorithm research.
doc	Duality and Mock Modularity EOS We derive a holomorphic anomaly equation for the Vafa-Witten partition function for twisted four-dimensional _EQN_ super Yang-Mills theory on _EQN_ for the gauge group _EQN_ from the path integral of the effective theory on the Coulomb branch. EOS The holomorphic kernel of this equation, which receives contributions only from the instantons, is not modular but `mock modular'. EOS The partition function has correct modular properties expected from _EQN_ -duality only after including the anomalous nonholomorphic boundary contributions from anti-instantons. EOS Using M-theory duality, we relate this phenomenon to the holomorphic anomaly of the elliptic genus of a two-dimensional noncompact sigma model and compute it independently in two dimensions.	The anomaly both in four and in two dimensions can be traced to a topological term in the effective action of six-dimensional (2,0) theory on the tensor branch.
doc	Matrix Quantum Mechanics and Two-dimensional String Theory in Non-trivial Backgrounds EOS String theory is the most promising candidate for the theory unifying all interactions including gravity. EOS It has an extremely difficult dynamics. EOS Therefore, it is useful to study some its simplifications. EOS One of them is non-critical string theory which can be defined in low dimensions. EOS A particular interesting case is 2D string theory. EOS On the one hand, it has a very rich structure and, on the other hand, it is solvable. EOS A complete solution of 2D string theory in the simplest linear dilaton background was obtained using its representation as Matrix Quantum Mechanics. EOS This matrix model provides a very powerful technique and reveals the integrability hidden in the usual CFT formulation.	This thesis extends the matrix model description of 2D string theory to non-trivial backgrounds.
doc	The simplest model of jamming EOS We study a well known machine learning model -the perceptron- as a simple model of jamming of hard objects. EOS We exhibit two regimes: 1) a convex optimisation regime where jamming is hypostatic and non-critical. EOS 2) a non convex optimisation regime where jamming is isostatic and critical. EOS We characterise the critical jamming phase through exponents describing the distributions law of forces and gaps. EOS Surprisingly we find that these exponents coincide with the corresponding ones recently computed in high dimensional hard spheres. EOS In addition, modifying the perceptron to a random linear programming problem, we show that isostaticity is not a sufficient condition for singular force and gap distributions. EOS For that, fragmentation of the space of solutions (replica symmetry breaking) appears to be a crucial ingredient.	We hypothesise universality for a large class of non-convex constrained satisfaction problems with continuous variables.

EOS In the case where _EQN_ is toric, we show that it arises from a bipartite graph _EQN_. EOS We characterize the lower dimensional faces of the associated edge cone _EQN_ explicitly in terms of subgraphs of _EQN_ and study the first order deformations of _EQN_. EOS We prove that _EQN_ is rigid if and only if the three-dimensional faces of edge cone _EQN_ are all simplicial.	Moreover, we reformulate this result in terms of Rothe diagram of _EQN_.
doc	Starlikeness and convexity for analytic functions concerned with Jack's lemma EOS There are many results for sufficient conditions of functions f(z) which are analytic in the open unit disc U to be starlike and convex in U. EOS The object of the present paper is to derive some interesting sufficient conditions for f(z) to be starlike of order \alpha\ and convex of order \alpha\ in U concerned with Jack's lemma.	Some examples for our results are also considered with the help of Mathematica 5.2.
doc	The Evolution of Extortion in Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Games EOS Iterated games are a fundamental component of economic and evolutionary game theory. EOS They describe situations where two players interact repeatedly and have the possibility to use conditional strategies that depend on the outcome of previous interactions. EOS In the context of evolution of cooperation, repeated games represent the mechanism of reciprocation. EOS Recently a new class of strategies has been proposed, so called 'zero determinant strategies'.	These strategies enforce a fixed linear relationship between one's own payoff and that of the other player.

doc	Efficient Multi-Jet Merging at High Multiplicities EOS We here present an extension of the CKKW-L multi-jet merging technique to so-called sector showers as implemented in the Vincia antenna shower. EOS The bijective nature of sector showers allows for efficient multi-jet merging at high multiplicities, as any given configuration possesses only a single "history", while retaining the accuracy of the CKKW-L technique. EOS Our method reduces the factorial scaling of the number of parton shower histories to a constant of a single history per colour-ordered final state.	We show that the complexity of constructing shower histories is reduced to an effective linear scaling with the number of final-state particles.
doc	Systematic reduction of the proton-removal cross section in neutron-rich medium-mass nuclei EOS Single neutron- and proton-removal cross sections have been systematically measured for 72 medium-mass neutron-rich nuclei around Z=50 and energies around 900A MeV using the FRagment Separator (FRS) at GSI. EOS Neutron-removal cross sections are described by considering the knock-out process together with initial- and final-state interactions.	Proton-removal cross sections are, however, significantly smaller than predicted by the same calculations.
doc	New Constraints on Additional Satellites of the Pluto System EOS Observations of Pluto and its solar-tidal stability zone were made using the Advanced Camera for Surveys' (ACS) Wide Field Channel (WFC) on the Hubble Space Telescope on UT 2005 May 15 and UT 2005 May 18. EOS Two small satellites of Pluto, provisionally designated S/2005 P 1 and S/2005 P 2, were discovered, as discussed by Weaver et al (2006) and Stern et al (2006a). EOS Confirming observations of the newly discovered moons were obtained using the ACS in the High Resolution Channel (HRC) mode on 2006 Feb 15 (Mutchler et al 2006). EOS Both sets of observations provide strong constraints on the existence of any additional satellites in the Pluto system. EOS Based on the May 2005 observations using the ACS/WFC, we place a 90%-confidence lower limit of m_V = 26.8 (m_V = 27.4 for a 50%-confidence lower limit) on the magnitude of undiscovered satellites greater than 5" (1.1x10^5 km) from Pluto. EOS Using the 2005 Feb 15 ACS/HRC observations we place 90%-confidence lower limits on the apparent magnitude of any additional satellites of m_V = 26.4 between 3"-5" (6.9x10^4-1.1x10^5 km) from Pluto, m_V = 25.7 between 1"-3" (2.3x10^4-6.9x10^4 km) from Pluto, and m_V = 24. EOS between 0.3"-1" (6.9x10^3-2.3x10^4 km) from Pluto.	The 90%-confidence magnitude limits translate into upper limits on the diameters of undiscovered satellites of 29 km outside of 5" from Pluto, 36 km between 3"-5" from Pluto, 49 km between 1"-3" from Pluto, and 115 km between 0.3"-1" for a comet-like albedo of p_V = 0.04.
doc	Secure sequential transmission of quantum information EOS We propose a quantum communication protocol that can be used to transmit any quantum state, one party to another via several intermediate nodes, securely on quantum communication network.

EOS dimensions.	The present model which is based on Hamilton's variational principle is confined to conservative non-dissipative isolated systems.
doc	Bounds on antipodal spherical designs with few angles EOS A finite subset _EQN_ on the unit sphere _EQN_ is called an _EQN_ -distance set with strength _EQN_ if its angle set _EQN_ has size _EQN_, and _EQN_ is a spherical _EQN_ -design but not a spherical _EQN_ -design. EOS In this paper, we consider to estimate the maximum size of such antipodal set for small _EQN_. EOS First, we improve the known bound on _EQN_ for each even integer _EQN_ when _EQN_. EOS We next focus on two special cases: _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS Estimating the size of _EQN_ for these two cases is equivalent to estimating the size of real equiangular tight frames (ETFs) and Levenstein-equality packings, respectively.	We first improve the previous estimate on the size of real ETFs and Levenstein-equality packings.

doc	The structure of Andromeda II dwarf spheroidal galaxy EOS We analyze in detail the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of two different stellar populations in Andromeda II (And II) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. EOS We obtained their detailed surface density maps, together with their radial density profiles. EOS The two populations differ not only in age and metallicity, but also in their spatial distribution and kinematics. EOS Old stars (_EQN_ Gyr) follow a round distribution well fitted by truncated density profiles. EOS These stars rotate around the projected optical major axis of the galaxy with line-of-sight velocities _EQN_ km s _EQN_ and a velocity gradient of _EQN_ km s _EQN_ arcmin _EQN_. EOS Intermediate-age stars (_EQN_ Gyr) concentrate in the centre of the galaxy and form an elongated structure extending along the projected optical major axis. EOS This structure appears to rotate with a velocity gradient of _EQN_ km s _EQN_ arcmin _EQN_, and around the optical minor axis. EOS The centres of rotation and kinetic position angles (PA _EQN_) of both populations differ. EOS For intermediate-age stars we obtained PA _EQN_ and for the old ones PA _EQN_ in good agreement with photometric PA measured from isopleths fitted to the photometry.	We conclude that the two stellar populations may not be fully relaxed and thus be the result of a merger occurred at redshift _EQN_.
doc	Calculation of density fluctuation in inflationary epoch EOS Starting from an initial state of thermal equilibrium, we derive an expression for the quantum fluctuation in the energy density during the inflationary epoch in terms of the mode functions for the inflaton field. EOS The effect of this particular initial state is not washed out in the final formula, contrary to what is usually believed. EOS Numerically, however, the effect is completely negligible, validating the use of the two point function in the vacuum state.	We also point out the requirement of conventional quantum field theory during inflation, that the quantum fluctuation in a wavelength must be evaluated, at the latest, when the wavelength crosses the Hubble length, in contrast to the usual practice in the literature.
doc	Constraints on dark matter annihilation from AMS-02 results EOS We use recently released data on the positron-to-electron ratio in cosmic rays from the AMS-02 experiment to constrain dark matter annihilation in the Milky Way. EOS Due to the yet unexplained positron excess, limits are generally weaker than those obtained using other probes, especially gamma rays.	This also means that explaining the positron excess in terms of dark matter annihilation is difficult.
doc	Compact storage ring to search for the muon electric dipole moment EOS We present the concept of a compact storage ring of less than 0.5 m orbit radius to search for the electric dipole moment of the muon (_EQN_) by adapting the "frozen spin" method. EOS At existing muon facilities a statistics limited sensitivity of _EQN_ can be achieved within one year of data taking.	Reaching this precision would demonstrate the viability of this novel technique to directly search for charged particle EDMs and already test a number of Standard Model extensions.
doc	More Fibonacci-Bernoulli relations with and without balancing polynomials EOS We continue our study on relationships between Bernoulli polynomials and balancing (Lucas-balancing) polynomials. EOS From these polynomial relations, we deduce new combinatorial identities with Fibonacci (Lucas) and Bernoulli numbers.	Moreover, we prove a special identity involving Bernoulli polynomials and Fibonacci numbers in arithmetic progression.
doc	Asymptotics of q-Plancherel measures EOS In this paper, we are interested in the asymptotic size of rows and columns of a random Young diagram under a natural deformation of the Plancherel measure coming from Hecke algebras. EOS The first lines of such diagrams are typically of order _EQN_, so it does not fit in the context studied by P. EOS Biane and P. EOS \'Sniady. EOS Using the theory of polynomial functions on Young diagrams of Kerov and Olshanski, we are able to compute explicitly the first- and second-order asymptotics of the length of the first rows.	Our method works also for other measures, for instance those coming from Schur-Weyl representations.
doc	Matrix product state representation of quasielectron wave functions EOS Matrix product state techniques provide a very efficient way to numerically evaluate certain classes of quantum Hall wave functions that can be written as correlators in two-dimensional conformal field theories. EOS Important examples are the Laughlin and Moore-Read ground states and their quasihole excitations. EOS In this paper, we extend the matrix product state techniques to evaluate quasielectron wave functions, a more complex task because the corresponding conformal field theory operator is not local. EOS We use our method to obtain density profiles for states with multiple quasielectrons and quasiholes, and to calculate the (mutual) statistical phases of the excitations with high precision. EOS The wave functions we study are subject to a known difficulty: the position of a quasielectron depends on the presence of other quasiparticles, even when their separation is large compared to the magnetic length.	Quasielectron wave functions constructed using the composite fermion picture, which are topologically equivalent to the quasielectrons we study, have the same problem.
doc	Crossover times in bipartite networks with activity constraints and time-varying switching rates EOS In this paper we study the performance of a bipartite network in which customers arrive at the nodes of the network, but not all nodes are able to serve their customers at all times. EOS Each node can be either active or inactive, and two nodes connected by a bond cannot be active simultaneously. EOS This situation arises in wireless random-access networks where, due to destructive interference, stations that are close to each other cannot use the same frequency band. EOS We consider a model where the network is bipartite, the active nodes switch themselves off at rate 1, and the inactive nodes switch themselves on at a rate that depends on time and on which half of the bipartite network they are in. EOS An inactive node cannot become active when one of the nodes it is connected to by a bond is active. EOS The switching protocol allows the nodes to share activity among each other.	In the limit as the activation rate becomes large, we compute the crossover time between the two states where one half of the network is active and the other half is inactive.
doc	The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Spatially resolving the environmental quenching of star formation in GAMA galaxies EOS We use data from the Sydney-AAO Multi-Object Integral Field Spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey and the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey to investigate the spatially-resolved signatures of the environmental quenching of star formation in galaxies. EOS Using dust-corrected measurements of the distribution of H _EQN_ emission we measure the radial profiles of star formation in a sample of 201 star-forming galaxies covering three orders of magnitude in stellar mass (M _EQN_ ; EOS _EQN_ - _EQN_ M _EQN_) and in _EQN_ nearest neighbour local environment density (_EQN_ ; EOS _EQN_ - _EQN_ Mpc _EQN_). EOS We show that star formation rate gradients in galaxies are steeper in dense (_EQN_ Mpc _EQN_) environments by _EQN_ r _EQN_ in galaxies with stellar masses in the range _EQN_ M _EQN_ M _EQN_ and that this steepening is accompanied by a reduction in the integrated star formation rate.	However, for any given stellar mass or environment density the star-formation morphology of galaxies shows large scatter.
doc	Historical light curve and search for previous outbursts of Nova KT Eridani (2009) EOS Context. EOS Nova Eridani (2009) caught the eye of the nova community due to its fast decline from maximum, which was initially missed, and its subsequent development in the radio and X-ray wavelengths. EOS This system also exhibits properties similar to those of the much smaller class of recurrent novae; EOS themselves potential progenitors of Type Ia Supernovae. EOS Aims. EOS We aim to determine the nature and physical parameters of the KT Eri progenitor system. EOS Methods. EOS We searched the Harvard College Observatory archive plates for the progenitor of KT Eri to determine the nature of the system, particularly the evolutionary stage of the secondary.We used the data obtained to search for any periodic signal and the derived luminosity to estimate a recurrence timescale. EOS Furthermore, by comparing the colours of the quiescent system on a colour-magnitude diagram we may infer the nature of the secondary star. EOS Results. EOS We identified the progenitor system of KT Eri and measured a quiescent magnitude of < B >= 14.7 \pm 0.4. EOS No previous outburst was found. EOS However, we suggest that if the nova is recurrent it should be on a timescale of centuries. EOS We find a periodicity at quiescence of 737 days which may arise from reflection effects and/or eclipses in the central binary.	The periodicity and the quiescence magnitude of the system suggest that the secondary star is evolved and likely in, or ascending, the Red Giant Branch.

EOS The low lying states of the system involve bound excitonic complexes such as (X^n)-. EOS The angular momenta of these complexes and the pseudopotentials describing their interaction are determined.	The similarity to the electron pseudopotential suggests the possibility of incompressible ground states of a gas of X- ions for nu<=1/3.

doc	AGN torus detectability at sub-millimeter wavelengths: What to expect from ALMA continuum data EOS We study the detectability of the emission associated with the AGN dusty structure at sub-mm wavelengths using ALMA, in a theoretical and observational way. EOS Theoretically, we use the Clumpy models from Nenkova et al together with the mid-infrared to X-ray and the radio fundamental plane scaling relations. EOS We find that it is more likely to detect bigger and denser dusty tori at the highest ALMA frequency (666 GHz/450 micron). EOS We also find that with 1h at 353 GHz/850 micron and 10h at 666 GHz/450 micron we can detect, with a high detection limit, a 1 mJy torus (characteristic of bright AGN).	This means, an object for which the unresolved SED at 12 micron has a flux ~1mJy.
doc	Beyond Batch Processing: Towards Real-Time and Streaming Big Data EOS Today, big data is generated from many sources and there is a huge demand for storing, managing, processing, and querying on big data. EOS The MapReduce model and its counterpart open source implementation Hadoop, has proven itself as the de facto solution to big data processing. EOS Hadoop is inherently designed for batch and high throughput processing jobs.	Although Hadoop is very suitable for batch jobs but there is an increasing demand for non-batch processes on big data like: interactive jobs, real-time queries, and big data streams.
doc	Polaronic inter-acceptor hopping transport in intrinsically doped nickel oxide EOS In this work, we revisit the issue of the nature of electronic transport in nickel oxide (NiO) and show that the widely used model of free small polaron hopping, initially raised to characterize transport in high-purity samples, is not appropriate for modeling intrinsically doped NiO. EOS Instead, we present extensive evidence, collected by means of temperature- and frequency-dependent measurements of the electrical conductivity _EQN_, that the model of polaronic inter-acceptor hopping can be used to consistently explain the electronic conduction process. EOS In this framework, holes are localized to acceptors (Ni vacancies), forming a strongly bound, polaron-like state.	They can only move through the film by hopping to a neighboring, at least partially unoccupied, acceptor.
doc	Optimal measurement-based feedback control for a single qubit: a candidate protocol EOS Feedback control of quantum systems via continuous measurement involves complex nonlinear dynamics. EOS Except in very special cases, even for a single qubit optimal feedback protocols are unknown. EOS Not even do intuitive candidates exist for choosing the measurement basis, which is the primary non-trivial ingredient in the feedback control of a qubit. EOS Here we present a series of arguments that suggest a particular form for the optimal protocol for a broad class of noise sources in the regime of good control. EOS This regime is defined as that in which the control is strong enough to keep the system close to the desired state.	With the assumption of this form the remaining parameters can be determined via a numerical search.
doc	Time-Resolved Ultraviolet Spectroscopy of the SW Sex Star DW UMa: Confirmation of a Hidden White Dwarf and the UV Counterpart to Phase 0.5 Absorption Events EOS We present time-resolved, ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy of the SW Sex star DW UMa in the high state. EOS We confirm that, shortward of 1500 \AA, the high-state, UV continuum level is lower than the white dwarf (WD)-dominated low-state level. EOS We also do not see the WD contact phases in the high state eclipse light curves. EOS These results confirm our earlier finding that the WD in this system is hidden from view in the high state. EOS Based on this, we caution that eclipse mapping of high-inclination SW Sex stars in the high state may yield incorrect or misleading results. EOS In the context of DW UMa, we demonstrate explicitly that distance estimates obtained by recent eclipse mapping studies cannot be reconciled with the WD-dominated low-state spectrum.	We also show that the fluxes of the UV emission lines in the high state drop near orbital phase 0.5.
doc	Vector and scalar form factors for K- and D-meson semileptonic decays from twisted mass fermions with Nf = 2 EOS We present lattice results for the form factors relevant in the K -> pion and D -> pion semileptonic decays, obtained from simulations with two flavors of dynamical twisted-mass fermions and pion masses as light as 260 MeV. EOS For K -> pion decays we discuss the estimates of the main sources of systematic uncertainties, including the quenching of the strange quark, leading to our final result f+(0) = 0.9560 (57) (62). EOS Combined with the latest experimental data, our value of f+(0) implies for the CKM matrix element |Vus| the value 0.2267 (5) (20) consistent with the first-row CKM unitarity.	For D -> pion decays the application of Heavy Meson Chiral Perturbation Theory allows to extrapolate our results for both the scalar and the vector form factors at the physical point with quite good accuracy, obtaining a nice agreement with the experimental data.
doc	Quantum computing with neutral atoms EOS The manipulation of neutral atoms by light is at the heart of countless scientific discoveries in the field of quantum physics in the last three decades. EOS The level of control that has been achieved at the single particle level within arrays of optical traps, while preserving the fundamental properties of quantum matter (coherence, entanglement, superposition), makes these technologies prime candidates to implement disruptive computation paradigms. EOS In this paper, we review the main characteristics of these devices from atoms / qubits to application interfaces, and propose a classification of a wide variety of tasks that can already be addressed in a computationally efficient manner in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era we are in. EOS We illustrate how applications ranging from optimization challenges to simulation of quantum systems can be explored either at the digital level (programming gate-based circuits) or at the analog level (programming Hamiltonian sequences).	We give evidence of the intrinsic scalability of neutral atom quantum processors in the 100-1,000 qubits range and introduce prospects for universal fault tolerant quantum computing and applications beyond quantum computing.
doc	The Afterglow of GRB 130427A from 1 to 10^16 GHz EOS We present multiwavelength observations of the afterglow of GRB 130427A, the brightest (in total fluence) gamma-ray burst of the past 29 years. EOS Optical spectroscopy from Gemini-North reveals the redshift of the GRB to be z=0.340, indicating that its unprecedented brightness is primarily the result of its relatively close proximity to Earth; EOS the intrinsic luminosities of both the GRB and its afterglow are not extreme in comparison to other bright GRBs. EOS We present a large suite of multiwavelength observations spanning from 300 s to 130 d after the burst and demonstrate that the afterglow shows relatively simple, smooth evolution at all frequencies with no significant late-time flaring or rebrightening activity. EOS The entire dataset from 1 GHz to 10 GeV can be modeled as synchrotron emission from a combination of reverse and forward shocks in good agreement with the standard afterglow model, providing strong support to the applicability of the underlying theory and clarifying the nature of the GeV emission observed to last for minutes to hours following other very bright GRBs. EOS A tenuous, wind-stratified circumburst density profile is required by the observations, suggesting a massive-star progenitor with a low mass-loss rate, perhaps due to low metallicity. EOS GRBs similar in nature to GRB 130427A, inhabiting low-density media and exhibiting strong reverse shocks, are probably not uncommon but may have been difficult to recognize in the past due to their relatively faint late-time radio emission;	more such events should be found in abundance by the new generation of sensitive radio and millimeter instruments.
doc	A generating function approach to branching random walks EOS It is well known that the behaviour of a branching process is completely described by the generating function of the offspring law and its fixed points. EOS Branching random walks are a natural generalization of branching processes: a branching process can be seen as a one-dimensional branching random walk. EOS We define a multidimensional generating function associated to a given branching random walk. EOS The present paper investigates the similarities and the differences of the generating functions, their fixed points and the implications on the underlying stochastic process, between the one-dimensional (branching process) and the multidimensional case (branching random walk). EOS In particular, we show that the generating function of a branching random walk can have uncountably many fixed points and a fixed point may not be an extinction probability, even in the irreducible case (extinction probabilities are always fixed points). EOS Moreover, the generating function might not be a convex function. EOS We also study how the behaviour of a branching random walk is affected by local modifications of the process.	As a corollary, we describe a general procedure with which we can modify a continuous-time branching random walk which has a weak phase and turn it into a continuous-time branching random walk which has strong local survival for large or small values of the parameter and non-strong local survival for intermediate values of the parameter.

doc	Moduli of _EQN_ -adic representations of a profinite group EOS Let _EQN_ be a smooth and proper scheme over an algebraically closed field. EOS The purpose of the current text is twofold. EOS First, we construct the moduli stack parametrizing rank _EQN_ continuous _EQN_ -adic representations of the \'etale fundamental group _EQN_. EOS Our construction realizes such object as a _EQN_ -analytic stack, denoted _EQN_. EOS Secondly, we prove that _EQN_ admits a canonical derived structure. EOS This derived structure allow us to intrinsically recover the deformation theory of continuous _EQN_ -adic representations, studied in [GV18].	Our proof of geometricity of _EQN_ uses in an essential way the _EQN_ -analytic analogue of Lurie-Artin representability, proved in [PY17].

doc	On the Time Dependence of Adiabatic Particle Number EOS We consider quantum field theoretic systems subject to a time-dependent perturbation, and discuss the question of defining a time dependent particle number not just at asymptotic early and late times, but also during the perturbation. EOS Naively, this is not a well-defined notion for such a non-equilibrium process, as the particle number at intermediate times depends on a basis choice of reference states with respect to which particles and anti-particles are defined, even though the final late-time particle number is independent of this basis choice.	The basis choice is associated with a particular truncation of the adiabatic expansion.

doc	Homogeneous vs. inhomogeneous coexistence of magnetic order and superconductivity probed by NMR in Co and K doped iron pnictides EOS In Ba(Fe0.95Co0.05)2As2 all of the 75As NMR intensity at the paramagnetic resonance position vanishes abruptly below Tonset(SDW)=56 K, indicating that magnetic (spin density wave) order is present in all of the sample volume, despite bulk superconductivity below Tc=15 K. EOS The two phases thus coexist homogeneously at the microscopic scale. EOS In Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, on the other hand, the signal loss below Tonset(SDW)~75 K is not complete, revealing that magnetic order is bound to finite-size areas of the sample, while the remaining NMR signal shows a clear superconducting response below Tc=37 K.	Thus, the two phases are not homogeneously mixed, at least for this potassium concentration.

EOS The proposed _EQN_ -QAM near-complementary sequences can be constructed by utilizing novel nonlinear offsets, where the length of the sequences is _EQN_.	The family size of the newly constructed _EQN_ -QAM near-complementary sequences is _EQN_, and the PMEPR of these sequences is proven to satisfy _EQN_.
doc	Resurgent Extrapolation: Rebuilding a Function from Asymptotic Data. Painleve I EOS Extrapolation is a generic problem in physics and mathematics: how to use asymptotic data in one parametric regime to learn about the behavior of a function in another parametric regime. EOS For example: extending weak coupling expansions to strong coupling, or high temperature expansions to low temperature, or vice versa. EOS Such extrapolations are particularly interesting in systems possessing dualities. EOS Here we study numerical procedures for performing such an extrapolation, combining ideas from resurgent asymptotics with well-known techniques of Borel summation, Pade approximants and conformal mapping.	We illustrate the method with the concrete example of the Painleve I equation, which has applications in many branches of physics and mathematics.

The constructed magnetic field-temperature (H-T) phase diagram resembles that of type-II superconductors.
doc	Non-Singular Stationary Global Strings EOS A field-theoretical model for non-singular global cosmic strings is presented. EOS The model is a non-linear sigma model with a potential term for a self-gravitating complex scalar field. EOS Non-singular stationary solutions with angular momentum and possibly linear momentum are obtained by assuming an oscillatory dependence of the scalar field on t, phi and z. EOS This dependence has an effect similar to gauging the global U(1) symmetry of the model, which is actually a Kaluza-Klein reduction from four to three spacetime dimensions.	The method of analysis can be regarded as an extension of the gravito-electromagnetism formalism beyond the weak field limit.

doc	Proving Noninterference by a Fully Complete Translation to the Simply Typed lambda-calculus EOS Tse and Zdancewic have formalized the notion of noninterference for Abadi et al's DCC in terms of logical relations and given a proof of noninterference by reduction to parametricity of System F. EOS Unfortunately, their proof contains errors in a key lemma that their translation from DCC to System F preserves the logical relations defined for both calculi. EOS In fact, we have found a counterexample for it. EOS In this article, instead of DCC, we prove noninterference for sealing calculus, a new variant of DCC, by reduction to the basic lemma of a logical relation for the simply typed lambda-calculus, using a fully complete translation to the simply typed lambda-calculus.	Full completeness plays an important role in showing preservation of the two logical relations through the translation.
doc	Realization of Nearly Dispersionless Bands with Strong Orbital Anisotropy from Destructive Interference in Twisted Bilayer MoS2 EOS Recently, the twist angle between adjacent sheets of stacked van der Waals materials emerged as a new knob to engineer correlated states of matter in two-dimensional heterostructures in a controlled manner, giving rise to emergent phenomena such as superconductivity or correlated insulating states. EOS Here,we use an ab initio based approach to characterize the electronic properties of twisted bilayer MoS2. EOS We report that, in marked contrast to twisted bilayer graphene, slightly hole-doped MoS2 realizes a strongly asymmetric px-py Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, with two almost entirely dispersionless bands emerging due to destructive interference.	We study the collective behavior of twisted bilayer MoS2 in the presence of interactions, and characterize an array of different magnetic and orbitally-ordered correlated phases,which may be susceptible to quantum fluctuations giving rise to exotic, purely quantum, states of matter.

EOS We drive the equation of state (EoS) parameter, deceleration parameter and the evolution equation for the Tsallis holographic dark energy density parameter.	Our study shows that this model can describe the current accelerating Universe in both noninteracting and interacting scenarios, and also a transition occurs from the deceleration phase to the accelerated phase, at the late time.
doc	A new encoding of coalescent processes. Applications to the additive and multiplicative cases EOS We revisit the discrete additive and multiplicative coalescents, starting with _EQN_ particles with unit mass. EOS These cases are known to be related to some "combinatorial coalescent processes": a time reversal of a fragmentation of Cayley trees or a parking scheme in the additive case, and the random graph process _EQN_ in the multiplicative case. EOS Time being fixed, encoding these combinatorial objects in real-valued processes indexed by the line is the key to describing the asymptotic behaviour of the masses as _EQN_.	We propose to use the Prim order on the vertices instead of the classical breadth-first (or depth-first) traversal to encode the combinatorial coalescent processes.
doc	Thom-Sebastiani & Duality for Matrix Factorizations EOS The derived category of a hypersurface has an action by "cohomology operations" k[t], deg t=-2, underlying the 2-periodic structure on its category of singularities (as matrix factorizations). EOS We prove a Thom-Sebastiani type Theorem, identifying the k[t]-linear tensor products of these dg categories with coherent complexes on the zero locus of the sum potential on the product (with a support condition), and identify the dg category of colimit-preserving k[t]-linear functors between Ind-completions with Ind-coherent complexes on the zero locus of the difference potential (with a support condition). EOS These results imply the analogous statements for the 2-periodic dg categories of matrix factorizations. EOS Some applications include: we refine and establish the expected computation of 2-periodic Hochschild invariants of matrix factorizations; EOS we show that the category of matrix factorizations is smooth, and is proper when the critical locus is proper;	we show how Calabi-Yau structures on matrix factorizations arise from volume forms on the total space;
doc	Photoinduced electron-electron pairing in the extended Falicov-Kimball model EOS By employing the time-dependent exact diagonalization method, we investigate the photoexcited states of the excitonic insulator in the extended Falicov-Kimball model (EFKM). EOS We here show that the pulse irradiation can induce the interband electron-electron pair correlation in the photoexcited states, while the excitonic electron-hole pair correlation in the initial ground state is strongly suppressed. EOS We also show that the photoexcited states contains the eigenstates of the EFKM with a finite number of interband electron-electron pairs, which are responsible for the enhancement of the electron-electron pair correlation. EOS The mechanism found here is due to the presence of the internal SU(2) pairing structure in the EFKM and thus it is essentially the same as that for the photoinduced _EQN_ -pairing in the repulsive Hubbard model reported recently [T.	Kaneko et al, Phys.

EOS Hestenes in 1974 introduced, within a Clifford algebra, an axiomatic binary relative velocity as a Minkowski bivector. EOS We propose consider binary relative velocity as a traceless nilpotent endomorphism in an operator algebra.	Any concept of a binary axiomatic relative velocity made possible the replacement of the Lorentz relativity group by the relativity groupoid.
doc	Virasoro conjecture for the stable pairs descendent theory of simply connected 3-folds (with applications to the Hilbert scheme of points of a surface) EOS This paper concerns the recent Virasoro conjecture for the theory of stable pairs on a 3-fold proposed by Oblomkov, Okounkov, Pandharipande and the author in arXiv:2008.12514. EOS Here we extend the conjecture to 3-folds with non- _EQN_ -cohomology and we prove it in two specializations. EOS For the first specialization, we let _EQN_ be a simply-connected surface and consider the moduli space _EQN_, which happens to be isomorphic to the Hilbert scheme _EQN_ of _EQN_ points on _EQN_. EOS The Virasoro constraints for stable pairs, in this case, can be formulated entirely in terms of descendents in the Hilbert scheme of points. EOS The two main ingredients of the proof are the toric case and the existence of universal formulas for integrals of descendents on _EQN_.	The second specialization consists in taking the 3-fold _EQN_ to be a cubic and the curve class _EQN_ to be the line class.

We introduce a control parameter, the radius of attenuation, and present some new simulations that shed light on how inflammation associated with cartilage injuries impacts the metabolic activity of cartilage cells.
doc	TeV physics and the Planck scale EOS Supersymmetry is one of the best motivated possibilities for new physics at the TeV scale. EOS However, both concrete string constructions and phenomenological considerations suggest the possibility that the physics at the TeV scale could be more complicated than the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), e.g., due to extended gauge symmetries, new vector-like supermultiplets with non-standard SU(2)xU(1) assignments, and extended Higgs sectors.	We briefly comment on some of these possibilities, and discuss in more detail the class of extensions of the MSSM involving an additional standard model singlet field.
doc	Shell structure underlying the evolution of quadrupole collectivity in S-38 and S-40 probed by transient-field g-factor measurements on fast radioactive beams EOS The shell structure underlying shape changes in neutron-rich nuclei between N=20 and N=28 has been investigated by a novel application of the transient field technique to measure the first-excited state g factors in S-38 and S-40 produced as fast radioactive beams. EOS Details of the new methodology are presented. EOS In both S-38 and S-40 there is a fine balance between the proton and neutron contributions to the magnetic moments.	Shell model calculations which describe the level schemes and quadrupole properties of these nuclei also give a satisfactory explanation of the g factors.

doc	Stars on the run: escaping from stellar clusters EOS A significant proportion of Milky Way stars are born in stellar clusters, which dissolve over time so that the members become part of the disc and halo populations of the Galaxy. EOS In the present work we will assume that these young stellar clusters live mainly within the disc of the Galaxy and that they can have primordial binary percentages ranging from 0% to as high as 70%. EOS We have evolved models of such clusters to an age of 4 Gyr through N-body simulations, paying attention to the stars and binaries that escape in the process. EOS We have quantified the contribution of these escaping stars to the Galaxy population by analysing their escape velocity and evolutionary stage at the moment of escape. EOS In this way we could analyse the mechanisms that produced these escapers, whether evaporation through weak two- body encounters, energetic close encounters or stellar evolution events, e.g.	supernovae.
doc	Mechanism for spectral break in cosmic ray proton spectrum from Supernova remnant W44 EOS Recent observations of the supernova remnant W44 by the ph Fermi spacecraft observatory strongly support the idea that the bulk of galactic cosmic rays is accelerated in such remnants by a Fermi mechanism, also known as diffusive shock acceleration. EOS However, the W44 expands into weakly ionized dense gas, and so a significant revision of the mechanism is required.	In this paper we provide the necessary modifications and demonstrate that strong ion-neutral collisions in the remnant surrounding lead to the steepening of the energy spectrum of accelerated particles by ph exactly one power.

doc	Reconstructing vibrational states in warm molecules using four-wave mixing with femtosecond laser pulses EOS We propose a method to reconstruct the vibrational quantum state of molecules excited by a general excitation laser pulse. EOS Unlike existing methods, we do not require the molecules before excitation to be in a pure state, allowing us to treat the important case of initially thermally excited molecules. EOS Even if only a single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small populations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational state, making it essential to take them into account. EOS In addition to the excitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a non-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. EOS The measurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave mixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. EOS An important point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of molecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming laser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration laser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are recorded. EOS The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the constant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of the excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have sufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of the same levels.	Finally, we discuss the extension of the reconstruction method in this paper to more general situations, hereby presenting the new idea of quantum state reconstruction through perturbations with calibration.

doc	On the connection between giant radio halos and cluster mergers EOS The frequently observed association between giant radio halos and merging galaxy clusters has driven present theoretical models of non-thermal emission from galaxy clusters, which are based on the idea that the energy dissipated during cluster-cluster mergers could power the formation of radio halos. EOS To quantitatively test the merger-halo connection we present the first statistical study based on deep radio data and X-ray observations of a complete X-ray selected sample of galaxy clusters with X-ray luminosity > 5x 10^44 erg/s and redshift 0.2<z< 0.32.	Using several methods to characterize cluster substructures, namely the power ratios, centroid shift and X-ray brightness concentration parameter, we show that clusters with and without radio halo can be quantitatively differentiated in terms of their dynamical properties.

doc	Regular induced subgraphs of a random graph EOS An old problem of Erd\H o s, Fajtlowicz and Staton asks for the order of a largest induced regular subgraph that can be found in every graph on n vertices. EOS Motivated by this problem, we consider the order of such a subgraph in a typical graph on n vertices, i.e., in a binomial random graph G(n,1/2).	We prove that with high probability a largest induced regular subgraph of G(n,1/2) has about n^ 2/3 vertices.
doc	Photon--meson transition form factors _EQN_, _EQN_ and _EQN_ at low and moderately high _EQN_ EOS We study photon--meson transition form factors _EQN_ at low and moderately high virtualities _EQN_ of one of the photons, the second photon being real. EOS For the description of the form factor at low _EQN_, a nontrivial quark--antiquark _EQN_ structure of the photon in the soft region is assumed, i.e. EOS the photon is treated much like an ordinary vector meson. EOS At large _EQN_, along with a perturbative tail of the soft wave function, as it is for a hadron, the photon wave function contains also a standard QED point-like _EQN_ component. EOS The latter provides the _EQN_ behavior of the transition form factor at large _EQN_ in accordance with perturbative QCD. EOS Using the experimental results on _EQN_ form factor, we reconstruct the soft photon wave function which is found to have the structure similar to pion's, which has been formerly determined from a study of the elastic pion form factor.	Assuming the universality of the ground--state pseudoscalar meson wave functions we calculate the transition form factors _EQN_, _EQN_ and partial widths _EQN_, _EQN_, in a perfect agreement with data.
doc	Classical resonance interactions and Josephson junction in macroscopic quantum dynamics EOS It is shown that the classical dynamics of 1:1 resonance interaction between two identical linearly coupled Duffing oscillators is equivalent to the symmetric (non-biased) case of `macroscopic' quantum dynamics of two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. EOS The analogy develops through the boson Josephson junction equations, however, reduced to a single conservative energy partition (EP) oscillator. EOS The derived oscillator is solvable in quadratures, furthermore it admits asymptotic solution in terms of elementary functions after transition to the action-angle variables. EOS Energy partition and coherency indexes are introduced to provide a complete characterization of the system dynamic states through the state variables of the EP oscillator. EOS In particular, nonlinear normal and local mode dynamics of the original system associate with equilibrium points of such oscillator.	Additional equilibrium points - the local modes - may occur on high energy level as a result of the symmetry breaking bifurcation, which is equivalent to the macroscopic quantum self-trapping effect in boson Josephson junction.

doc	X-ray flux variability of active galactic nuclei observed using NuSTAR EOS We present results on a systematic study of flux variability on hourly time-scales in a large sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the 3-79 keV band using data from Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array. EOS Our sample consists of 4 BL Lac objects (BL Lacs), 3 flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) 24 Seyfert 1, 42 Seyfert 2 and 8 narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies. EOS We find that in the 3-79 keV band, about 65% of the sources in our sample show significant variations on hourly time scales. EOS Using Mann-Whitney U-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we find no difference in the variability behaviour between Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies. EOS The blazar sources (FSRQs and BL Lacs) in our sample, are more variable than Seyfert galaxies that include Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 in the soft (3-10 keV), hard (10-79 keV) and total (3-79 keV) bands.	NLSy1 galaxies show the highest duty cycle of variability (87%), followed by BL Lacs (82%), Seyfert galaxies (56%) and FSRQs (23%).

doc	Assessing Information Transmission in Data Transformations with the Channel Multivariate Entropy Triangle EOS Data transformation, e.g. EOS feature transformation and selection, is an integral part of any machine learning procedure. EOS In this paper we introduce an information-theoretic model and tools to assess the quality of data transformations in machine learning tasks. EOS In an unsupervised fashion, we analyze the transfer of information of the transformation of a discrete, multivariate source of information X into a discrete, multivariate sink of information Y related by a distribution PXY.	The first contribution is a decomposition of the maximal potential entropy of (X, Y) that we call a balance equation, into its a) non-transferable, b) transferable but not transferred and c) transferred parts.
doc	On the temporal variability classes found in long gamma-ray bursts with known redshift EOS Based on the analysis of a small sample of BATSE and Konus gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with know redshift it has been reported that the width of the autocorrelation function (ACF) shows a remarkable bimodal distribution in the rest-frame of the source. EOS However, the origin of these two well-separated ACF classes remains unexplained.We complement previous ACF analysis studying the corresponding power density spectra (PDS). EOS With the addition of Beppo-SAX data and taken advantage of its broad-band capability, we not only increase the burst sample but we extend the analysis to X-ray energies. EOS The rest-frame PDS analysis at gamma-ray energies shows that the two ACF classes are not simply characterised by a different low frequency cut-off, but they have a distinct variability as a whole in the studied frequency range.	Both classes exhibit average PDS with power-law behaviour at high frequencies (f' > 0.1 Hz) but significantly different slopes, with index values close to those of Brownian (-2) and Kolmogorov (-5/3) spectra for the narrow and broad classes respectively.
doc	A Simple Phenomenological Model for Grain Clustering in Turbulence EOS We propose a simple model for density fluctuations of aerodynamic grains, embedded in a turbulent, gravitating gas disk. EOS The model combines a calculation for the behavior of a group of grains encountering a single turbulent eddy, with a hierarchical approximation of the eddy statistics. EOS This makes analytic predictions for a range of quantities including: distributions of grain densities, power spectra and correlation functions of fluctuations, and maximum grain densities reached. EOS We predict how these scale as a function of grain drag time t_stop, spatial scale, grain-to-gas mass ratio, strength of turbulence (alpha), and detailed disk properties. EOS We test these against numerical simulations with various turbulence-driving mechanisms. EOS The simulations agree well with the predictions, spanning t_stop*Omega ~ 1e-4 - 10, alpha ~ 1e-10 - 1e-2, and grain-to-gas mass ratio ~0-3. EOS Results from 'turbulent concentration' simulations and laboratory experiments are also predicted as a special case. EOS Vortices on a wide range of scales disperse and concentrate grains hierarchically. EOS For small grains this is most efficient in eddies with turnover time comparable to the stopping time, but fluctuations are also damped by local gas-grain drift. EOS For large grains, shear and gravity lead to a much broader range of eddy scales driving fluctuations, with most power on the largest scales.	The grain density distribution has a log-Poisson shape, with fluctuations for large grains up to factors >1000.
doc	The enriched Vietoris monad on representable spaces EOS Employing a formal analogy between ordered sets and topological spaces, over the past years we have investigated a notion of cocompleteness for topological, approach and other kind of spaces. EOS In this new context, the down-set monad becomes the filter monad, cocomplete ordered set translates to continuous lattice, distributivity means disconnectedness, and so on. EOS Curiously, the dual(? EOS) notion of completeness does not behave as the mirror image of the one of cocompleteness; EOS and in this paper we have a closer look at complete spaces. EOS In particular, we construct the "up-set monad" on representable spaces (in the sense of L.	Nachbin for topological spaces, respectively C.
doc	Fast and Flexible CCD Driver System Using Fast DAC and FPGA EOS We have developed a completely new type of general-purpose CCD data acquisition system which enables one to drive any type of CCD using any type of clocking mode. EOS A CCD driver system widely used before consisted of an analog multiplexer (MPX), a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and an operational amplifier. EOS A DAC is used to determine high and low voltage levels and the MPX selects each voltage level using a TTL clock. EOS In this kind of driver board, it is difficult to reduce the noise caused by a short of high and low level in MPX and also to select many kinds of different voltage levels.	Recent developments in semiconductor IC enable us to use a very fast sampling (_EQN_ 10MHz) DAC with low cost.
doc	A relationship between rational and multi-soliton solutions of the BKP hierarchy EOS We consider a special class of solutions of the BKP hierarchy which we call _EQN_ -functions of hypergeometric type. EOS These are series in Schur _EQN_ -functions over partitions, with coefficients parameterised by a function of one variable _EQN_, where the quantities _EQN_, _EQN_, are integrals of motion of the BKP hierarchy. EOS We show that this solution is, at the same time, a infinite soliton solution of a dual BKP hierarchy, where the variables _EQN_ are now related to BKP higher times. EOS In particular, rational solutions of the BKP hierarchy are related to (finite) multi-soliton solution of the dual BKP hierarchy. EOS The momenta of the solitons are given by the parts of partitions in the Schur _EQN_ -function expansion of the _EQN_ -function of hypergeometric type. EOS We also show that the KdV and the NLS soliton _EQN_ -functions coinside the BKP _EQN_ -functions of hypergeometric type, evaluated at special point of BKP higher time;	the variables _EQN_ (which are BKP integrals of motions) being related to KdV and NLS higher times.

doc	MasQU: Finite Differences on Masked Irregular Stokes Q,U Grids EOS The detection of B-mode polarization in the CMB is one of the most important outstanding tests of inflationary cosmology. EOS One of the necessary steps for extracting polarization information in the CMB is reducing contamination from so-called "ambiguous modes" on a masked sky, which contain leakage from the larger E-mode signal. EOS This can be achieved by utilising derivative operators on the real-space Stokes Q and U parameters. EOS This paper presents an algorithm and a software package to perform this procedure on the nearly full sky, i.e., with projects such as the Planck Surveyor and future satellites in mind;	in particular, the package can perform finite differences on masked, irregular grids and is applied to a semi-regular spherical pixellization, the HEALPix grid.
doc	Individual-based models for bacterial chemotaxis in the diffusion asymptotics EOS We discuss velocity-jump models for chemotaxis of bacteria with an internal state that allows the velocity jump rate to depend on the memory of the chemoattractant concentration along their path of motion. EOS Using probabilistic techniques, we provide a pathwise result that shows that the considered process converges to an advection-diffusion process in the (long-time) diffusion limit. EOS We also (re-)prove using the same approach that the same limiting equation arises for a related, simpler process with direct sensing of the chemoattractant gradient. EOS Additionally, we propose a time discretization technique that retains these diffusion limits exactly, i.e., without error that depends on the time discretization.	In the companion paper REF, these results are used to construct a coupling technique that allows numerical simulation of the process with internal state with asymptotic variance reduction, in the sense that the variance vanishes in the diffusion limit.

doc	Computational issues and numerical experiments for Linear Multistep Method Particle Filtering EOS The Linear Multistep Method Particle Filter (LMM PF) is a method for predicting the evolution in time of a evolutionary system governed by a system of differential equations. EOS If some of the parameters of the governing equations are unknowns, it is possible to organize the calculations so as to estimate them while following the evolution of the system in time. EOS The underlying assumption in the approach that we present is that all unknowns are modelled as random variables, where the randomness is an indication of the uncertainty of their values rather than an intrinsic property of the quantities.	Consequently, the states of the system and the parameters are described in probabilistic terms by their density, often in the form of representative samples.
doc	Spin-filtering and charge- and spin-switching effects in a quantum wire with periodically attached stubs EOS Spin-dependent electron transport in a periodically stubbed quantum wire in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is studied via the nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with the Landauer-Buttiker formalism. EOS The coexistence of spin filtering, charge and spin switching are found in the considered system. EOS The mechanism of these transport properties is revealed by analyzing the total charge density and spin-polarized density distributions in the stubbed quantum wire.	Furthermore, periodic spin-density islands with high polarization are also found inside the stubs, owing to the interaction between the charge density islands and the Rashba SOI-induced effective magnetic field.

doc	On an Extension of the Mean Index to a large subset of Linear Canonical Relations EOS In this paper, viewing the symplectic linear group as a subset of the Lagrangian Grassmannian we extend the mean index to the complement of a codimension-two subset of the Grassmannian.	This extension retains many of the desirable properties of the mean index, the most significant of which are continuity and a homogeneity condition adapted to the set-theoretic composition of canonical relations.
doc	Decoherence of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Geometries in the Presence of Massive Vector Fields with U(1) or SO(3) Global Symmetries EOS Retrieval of classical behaviour in quantum cosmology is usually discussed in the framework of midi superspace models in the presence of scalar fields and the inhomogeneous modes corresponding either to gravitational or scalar fields. EOS In this work, we propose an alternative model to study the decoherence of homogeneous and isotropic geometries where the scalar field is replaced by a massive vector field with a global internal symmetry. EOS We study here the cases with _EQN_ and _EQN_ global internal symmetries. EOS The presence of a mass term breaks the conformal invariance and allows for the longitudinal modes of the spin-1 field to be present in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. EOS In the case of the U(1) global internal symmetry, we have only one single ``classical'' degree of freedom while in the case of the SO(3) global symmetry, we are led to consider a simple two-dimensional minisuperspace model. EOS These minisuperspaces are shown to be equivalent to a set of coupled harmonic oscillators where the kinetic term of the longitudinal modes has a coefficient proportional to the inverse of the scale factor. EOS The conditions for a suitable decoherence process and correlations between coordinate and momenta are established.	The validity of the semi-classical Einstein equations when massive vector fields (Abelian and non-Abelian) are present is also discussed.

EOS Remanence, coercivity and domain patterns were observed at room temperature (RT).

Our process should help to overcome superparamagnetism without compromise on the lateral size if SO systems are ever to be used in applications.

The performance of our strategies is measured in quadratic losses through a regret criterion.

While the former (transverse SAM) is independent of the helicity of the incident circular polarization state, the latter (transverse Poynting vector) depends upon the polarization state.

Rasmussen's s-invariant, a slice obstruction within the general framework of Khovanov homology, changes this state of affairs.
doc	Advance Warning Methodologies for COVID-19 using Chest X-Ray Images EOS Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global health concern after its first known detection in December 2019. EOS As a result, accurate and reliable advance warning system for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 has now become a priority. EOS The detection of COVID-19 in early stages is not a straightforward task from chest X-ray images according to expert medical doctors because the traces of the infection are visible only when the disease has progressed to a moderate or severe stage. EOS In this study, our first aim is to evaluate the ability of recent state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques for the early detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. EOS Both compact classifiers and deep learning approaches are considered in this study. EOS Furthermore, we propose a recent compact classifier, Convolutional Support Estimator Network (CSEN) approach for this purpose since it is well-suited for a scarce-data classification task.	Finally, this study introduces a new benchmark dataset called Early-QaTa-COV19, which consists of 175 early-stage COVID-19 Pneumonia samples (very limited or no infection signs) labelled by the medical doctors and 1579 samples for control (normal) class.
doc	Quantum Randi Challenge EOS Observed violations of Bell type inequalities exclude all relativistic micro causal ("local"), counterfactual definite ("real") hidden variable models of nature. EOS This further relativization of our concept of reality triggers a growing pseudoscientific resistance against quantum mechanics (QM). EOS I define Didactic Randi Challenges (DRC) via five characteristics. EOS These are challenges which, according to the laws of nature, are impossible to meet. EOS They effectively refute pseudoscientific claims according to which the challenge could easily be met.	DRC work by being known to exist while never having been overcome, despite the large rewards which would follow from meeting the challenge.
doc	Isentropic thermal instability in atomic surface layers of photodissociation regions EOS We consider the evolution of an isentropic thermal instability in the atomic zone of a photodissociation region (PDR). EOS In this zone, gas heating and cooling are associated mainly with photoelectric emission from dust grains and fine-structure lines ([\ion C ii ] 158, [\ion O i ] 63, and [\ion O i ] 146 \micron), respectively. EOS The instability criterion has a multi-parametric dependence on the conditions of the interstellar medium. EOS We found that instability occurs when the intensity of the incident far-ultraviolet field _EQN_ and gas density _EQN_ are high. EOS For example, we have _EQN_ and _EQN_ \cmc at temperatures _EQN_ K for typical carbon and oxygen abundances _EQN_ and _EQN_. EOS The instability criterion depends on the relation between _EQN_ and _EQN_ abundances and line opacities. EOS We also give examples of observed PDRs where instability could occur. EOS For these PDRs, the characteristic perturbation growth time is _EQN_ -- _EQN_ yr and the distance characterizing the formation of secondary waves is _EQN_ -- _EQN_ pc. EOS For objects that are older than _EQN_ and have sizes of the atomic zone larger than _EQN_, we expect that instability influences the PDR structure significantly.	The presence of multiple shock waves, turbulent velocities of several kilometers per second and inhomogeneities with higher density and temperature than the surrounding medium can characterize isentropic thermal instability in PDRs.

Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate that specific long-range correlations of the isotopic disorder can suppress or enhance the vibrational modes in pre-defined frequency windows.

doc	Coalescence of sessile drops EOS We present an experimental and theoretical description of the kinetics of coalescence of two water drops on a plane solid surface. EOS The case of partial wetting is considered. EOS The drops are in an atmosphere of nitrogen saturated with water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and coalesce. EOS A new convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially and slowly relaxes to an equilibrium hemispherical cap. EOS The characteristic relaxation time is proportional to the drop radius R * at final equilibrium. EOS This relaxation time appears to be nearly 10 7 times larger than the bulk capillary relaxation time t b = R * _EQN_ / _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the gas--liquid surface tension and _EQN_ is the liquid shear viscosity. EOS In order to explain this extremely large relaxation time, we consider a model that involves an Arrhenius kinetic factor resulting from a liquid--vapour phase change in the vicinity of the contact line. EOS The model results in a large relaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of vaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. EOS We model the late time relaxation for a near spherical cap and find an exponential relaxation whose typical time scale agrees reasonably well with the experiment.	1.

EOS We prove that the conjugacy classes of roots of the Dehn twist about a nonseparating curve correspond to the conjugacy classes of periodic maps with certain conditions. EOS Futhermore, we give data set which determine the conjugacy class of a root.	As a consequence, we can find the minimum degree and the maximum degree, and show that the degree must be odd.
doc	On finding fields and self-force in a gauge appropriate to separable wave equations EOS Gravitational waves from the inspiral of a stellar-size black hole to a supermassive black hole can be accurately approximated by a point particle moving in a Kerr background.	This paper presents progress on finding the electromagnetic and gravitational field of a point particle in a black-hole spacetime and on computing the self-force in a ``radiation gauge.'' The gauge is chosen to allow one to compute the perturbed metric from a gauge-invariant component _EQN_ (or _EQN_) of the Weyl tensor and follows earlier work by Chrzanowski and Cohen and Kegeles (we correct a minor, but propagating, error in the Cohen-Kegeles formalism).

EOS After a careful subtraction of the stellar continuum, the only emission line we detected in the data cube was H _EQN_. EOS An analysis of this emission revealed the existence of a rotating molecular torus/disk, aproximately co-planar with a dusty structure detected by us in a previous work.	We interpret these two structures as being associated with the same obscuring torus/disk.
doc	Reconnection of a kinking flux rope triggering the ejection of a microwave and hard X-ray source. II. Numerical Modeling EOS Numerical simulations of the helical (_EQN_) kink instability of an arched, line-tied flux rope demonstrate that the helical deformation enforces reconnection between the legs of the rope if modes with two helical turns are dominant as a result of high initial twist in the range _EQN_. EOS Such reconnection is complex, involving also the ambient field.	In addition to breaking up the original rope, it can form a new, low-lying, less twisted flux rope.

doc	GenHap: A Novel Computational Method Based on Genetic Algorithms for Haplotype Assembly EOS The computational problem of inferring the full haplotype of a cell starting from read sequencing data is known as haplotype assembly, and consists in assigning all heterozygous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to exactly one of the two chromosomes. EOS Indeed, the knowledge of complete haplotypes is generally more informative than analyzing single SNPs and plays a fundamental role in many medical applications.	To reconstruct the two haplotypes, we addressed the weighted Minimum Error Correction (wMEC) problem, which is a successful approach for haplotype assembly.

doc	Finalizing tentative matches from truncated preference lists EOS Consider the standard hospitals/residents problem, or the two-sided many-to-one stable matching problem, and assume that the true preference lists of both sides are complete and strict. EOS The lists actually submitted, however, are truncated. EOS Let I be such a truncated instance. EOS When we apply the resident-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm of Gale and Shapley to I, the algorithm produces a set of tentative matches (resident-hospital pairs). EOS We say that a tentative match in this set is finalizable in I if it is in the resident-optimal stable matching for every completion of I (a complete instance of which I is a truncation). EOS We study the problem we call FTM (Finalizability of Tentative Matches) of deciding if a given tentative match is finalizable in a given truncated instance. EOS We first show that FTM is coNP-complete, even in the stable marriage case where the quota of each hospital is restricted to be 1. EOS We then introduce and study a special case: we say that a truncated instance is resident-minimal, if further truncation of the preference lists of the residents inevitably changes the set of tentative matches. EOS Resident-minimal instances are not only practically motivated but also useful in natural backtrack computations for the general case. EOS We give a computationally useful characterization of negative instances of FTM in this special case, which, for instance, can be used to formulate an integer program for FTM. EOS For the stable marriage case, in particular, this characterization yields a polynomial time algorithm to solve FTM for resident-minimal instances.	On the other hand, we show that FTM remains coNP-complete for resident-minimal instances, if the maximum quota of the hospitals is 2 or larger.

For rectangular periodic domains a Kolmogorov-like flow consisting of a periodic array of alternating unidirectional jets with embedded vortices is observed, together with an underlying weak meandering transverse jet.
doc	Higgs amplitude mode in the vicinity of a _EQN_ -dimensional quantum critical point: a nonperturbative renormalization-group approach EOS We study the "Higgs" amplitude mode in the relativistic quantum O(_EQN_) model in two space dimensions. EOS Using the nonperturbative renormalization group and the Blaizot--M\'endez-Galain--Wschebor approximation (which we generalize to compute 4-point correlation functions), we compute the O(_EQN_) invariant scalar susceptibility at zero temperature in the vicinity of the quantum critical point. EOS In the ordered phase, we find a well-defined Higgs resonance for _EQN_ and _EQN_ and determine its universal properties. EOS No resonance is found for _EQN_. EOS In the disordered phase, the spectral function exhibits a threshold behavior with no Higgs-like peak. EOS We also show that for _EQN_ the Higgs mode manifests itself as a very broad peak in the longitudinal susceptibility in spite of the infrared divergence of the latter.	We compare our findings with results from quantum Monte Carlo simulations and _EQN_ expansion near _EQN_.
doc	Surface phonon induced rotational dissipation for nanoscale solid-state gears EOS Compared to nanoscale friction of translational motion, the mechanisms of rotational friction have received less attention. EOS Such motion becomes an important issue for the miniaturization of mechanical machineries which often involve rotating gears. EOS In this study, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to explore rotational friction for solid-state gears rotating on top of different substrates. EOS In each case, viscous damping of the rotational motion is observed and found to be induced by the pure van-der-Waals interaction between gear and substrate.	The influence of different gear sizes and various substrate materials is investigated.
doc	Frequency-Aware Reconstruction of Fluid Simulations with Generative Networks EOS Convolutional neural networks were recently employed to fully reconstruct fluid simulation data from a set of reduced parameters.

This directly correlates with the quality of the perceived results, since missing high frequency details are easily noticeable.

However, such a highly positive impact is coupled with significant challenges: How do we understand the decisions suggested by these systems in order that we can trust them?
doc	Inertial forces and the foundations of optical geometry EOS Assuming a general timelike congruence of worldlines as a reference frame, we derive a covariant general formalism of inertial forces in General Relativity. EOS Inspired by the works of Abramowicz et. EOS al. EOS (see e.g. EOS Abramowicz and Lasota, Class. EOS Quantum Grav. EOS 14 (1997) A23), we also study conformal rescalings of spacetime and investigate how these affect the inertial force formalism. EOS While many ways of describing spatial curvature of a trajectory has been discussed in papers prior to this, one particular prescription (which differs from the standard projected curvature when the reference is shearing) appears novel. EOS For the particular case of a hypersurface-forming congruence, using a suitable rescaling of spacetime, we show that a geodesic photon is always following a line that is spatially straight with respect to the new curvature measure. EOS This fact is intimately connected to Fermat's principle, and allows for a certain generalization of the optical geometry as will be further pursued in a companion paper (Jonsson and Westman, Class. EOS Quantum Grav. EOS 23 (2006) 61). EOS For the particular case when the shear-tensor vanishes, we present the inertial force equation in three-dimensional form (using the bold face vector notation), and note how similar it is to its Newtonian counterpart. EOS From the spatial curvature measures that we introduce, we derive corresponding covariant differentiations of a vector defined along a spacetime trajectory. EOS This allows us to connect the formalism of this paper to that of Jantzen et. EOS al. EOS (see e.g. EOS Bini et. EOS al., Int. EOS J. EOS Mod. EOS Phys.	D 6 (1997) 143).
doc	Exploring the role of the charm quark in the _EQN_ rule EOS We study the dependence on the charm quark mass of the leading-order low-energy constants of the _EQN_ effective Hamiltonian, with the aim of elucidating the role of the charm mass scale in the _EQN_ rule for _EQN_ decay. EOS To that purpose, finite-volume Chiral Perturbation Theory predictions are matched to QCD simulations, performed in the quenched approximation with overlap fermions and _EQN_. EOS Light quark masses range between a few MeV up to around one third of the physical strange mass, while charm masses range between _EQN_ and a few hundred MeV.

doc	Discovery of Fundamental Mass Ratio Relationships of Whole-Rock Chondritic Major Elements: Implications on Ordinary Chondrite Formation and on Planet Mercury's Composition EOS The high occurrence on Earth of ordinary chondrite meteorites and the making of models based upon arbitrary assumptions has led to some confusion about the origin of ordinary chondrites. EOS Major element fractionation among chondrites has been discussed for decades as ratios relative to Si or Mg. EOS Expressing ratios relative to Fe leads to a new relationship admitting the possibility that ordinary chondrite meteorites are derived from two components: one is a relatively undifferentiated, primitive component, oxidized like the CI or C1 chondrites; EOS the other is a somewhat differentiated, planetary component, with oxidation state like the reduced enstatite chondrites.	Such a picture would seem to explain for the ordinary chondrites, their major element compositions, their intermediate states of oxidation, and their ubiquitous defiencies of refractory siderophile elements.

doc	A Latitude-Dependent Analysis of the Leptonic Hypothesis for the Fermi Bubbles EOS The Fermi Bubbles are giant Galactic structures observed in both gamma-rays and microwaves. EOS Recent studies have found support for the hypothesis that the gamma-ray and microwave emission can both be understood as arising from a hard cosmic-ray electron population within the volume of the Bubbles, via inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation respectively. EOS The relative rates of these processes are set by the relative energy density of the interstellar radiation field and the magnetic field within the Bubbles; EOS consequently, under the hypothesis of a common origin, the combination of the gamma-ray and microwave measurements can be used to estimate the magnetic field within the Bubbles. EOS We revisit the consistency of this hypothesis on a latitude-by-latitude basis, using data from Fermi, WMAP and Planck; EOS estimate the variation of the electron spectrum within the Bubbles; EOS and infer bounds on the magnetic field within the Bubbles as a function of distance from the Galactic plane. EOS We find that while the microwave and gamma-ray spectra are generally consistent with the leptonic hypothesis for few-microGauss magnetic fields, there appears to be a preference for spectral hardening in the microwaves at mid-latitudes (especially in the |b|~ 25-35 degree range) that is not mirrored in the gamma rays. EOS This result may hint at a non-leptonic contribution to the gamma-ray spectra;	however, the discrepancy can be reconciled in purely leptonic models if the cutoff energy for the electrons is lower in this latitude range and the spectrum below the cutoff is harder.

A good agreement between theoretical and experimental behaviour was demonstrated.
doc	Granular flow from silos with rotating orifice EOS For granular materials falling through a circular exit at the bottom of a silo, no continuous flow can be sustained when the diameter D of the exit is less than 5 times the characteristic size of the grains. EOS If the bottom of the silo rotates horizontally with respect to the wall of the silo, finite flow rate can be sustained even at small D. EOS We investigate the effect of bottom rotation to the flow rate of a cylindrical silo filled with mono-disperse plastic beads of d = 6 mm diameter. EOS We find that the flow rate W follows Beverloo Law down to D = 1.2d and that W increases with the rotation rate \omega in the small exit regime. EOS If the exit is at an off-center distance R from the axis of the silo, W increases with rate of area swept by the exit. EOS On the other hand, when the exit diameter is large, W decreases with rotation speed at small \omega but increases with \omega at large \omega.	Such non-monotonic behavior of W on rotation speed may be explained as a gradual change from funnel flow to mass flow due to the shear at the bottom of the silo
doc	Quantum Bootstrapping via Compressed Quantum Hamiltonian Learning EOS Recent work has shown that quantum simulation is a valuable tool for learning empirical models for quantum systems.

This leads to a new application for small quantum computers: characterizing and controlling larger quantum computers.
doc	Analyzing a Tandem Fluid Queueing Model with Stochastic Capacity and Spillback EOS The tandem fluid queueing model is a useful tool for performance analysis and control design for a variety of transportation systems. EOS In this article, we study the joint impact of stochastic capacity and spillback on the long-time properties of this model. EOS Our analysis focuses on the system of two fluid queueing links in series. EOS The upstream link has a constant capacity (saturation rate) and an infinite buffer size. EOS The downstream link has a stochastic capacity and a finite buffer size. EOS Queue spillback occurs when the the downstream link is full.	We derive a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for the total queue length to be bounded on average.
doc	An Eye for an Eye: Economics of Retaliation in Mining Pools EOS Currently, miners typically join mining pools to solve cryptographic puzzles together, and mining pools are in high competition. EOS This has led to the development of several attack strategies such as block withholding (BWH) and fork after withholding (FAW) attacks that can weaken the health of PoW systems and but maximize mining pools' profits. EOS In this paper, we present strategies called Adaptive Retaliation Strategies (ARS) to mitigate not only BWH attacks but also FAW attacks.	In ARS, each pool cooperates with other pools in the normal situation, and adaptively executes either FAW or BWH attacks for the purpose of retaliation only when attacked.
doc	Efficient Large-Scale Graph Processing on Hybrid CPU and GPU Systems EOS The increasing scale and wealth of inter-connected data, such as those accrued by social network applications, demand the design of new techniques and platforms to efficiently derive actionable knowledge from large-scale graphs. EOS However, real-world graphs are famously difficult to process efficiently. EOS Not only they have a large memory footprint, but also most graph algorithms entail memory access patterns with poor locality, data-dependent parallelism and a low compute-to-memory access ratio. EOS Moreover, most real-world graphs have a highly heterogeneous node degree distribution, hence partitioning these graphs for parallel processing and simultaneously achieving access locality and load-balancing is difficult. EOS This work starts from the hypothesis that hybrid platforms (e.g., GPU-accelerated systems) have both the potential to cope with the heterogeneous structure of real graphs and to offer a cost-effective platform for high-performance graph processing.	This work assesses this hypothesis and presents an extensive exploration of the opportunity to harness hybrid systems to process large-scale graphs efficiently.

Our index computations are based on a correction term which is defined as follows: around a non-degenerate Hamiltonian orbit lying in a fixed energy level a well-known theorem says that one can find a whole cylinder of orbits parametrized by the energy.
doc	Migration of Extrasolar Planets: Effects from X-Wind Accretion Disks EOS Magnetic fields are dragged in from the interstellar medium during the gravitational collapse that forms star/disk systems. EOS Consideration of mean field magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in these disks shows that magnetic effects produce subkeplerian rotation curves and truncate the inner disk. EOS This letter explores the ramifications of these predicted disk properties for the migration of extrasolar planets. EOS Subkeplerian flow in gaseous disks drives a new migration mechanism for embedded planets and modifies the gap opening processes for larger planets. EOS This subkeplerian migration mechanism dominates over Type I migration for sufficiently small planets (m_P < 1 M_\earth) and/or close orbits (r < 1 AU). EOS Although the inclusion of subkeplerian torques shortens the total migration time by only a moderate amount, the mass accreted by migrating planetary cores is significantly reduced. EOS Truncation of the inner disk edge (for typical system parameters) naturally explains final planetary orbits with periods P=4 days. EOS Planets with shorter periods P=2 days can be explained by migration during FU-Ori outbursts, when the mass accretion rate is high and the disk edge moves inward. EOS Finally, the midplane density is greatly increased at the inner truncation point of the disk (the X-point);	this enhancement, in conjunction with continuing flow of gas and solids through the region, supports the in situ formation of giant planets.
doc	A Price-Per-Attention Auction Scheme Using Mouse Cursor Information EOS Payments in online ad auctions are typically derived from click-through rates, so that advertisers do not pay for ineffective ads. EOS But advertisers often care about more than just clicks. EOS That is, for example, if they aim to raise brand awareness or visibility. EOS There is thus an opportunity to devise a more effective ad pricing paradigm, in which ads are paid only if they are actually noticed.	This article contributes a novel auction format based on a pay-per-attention (PPA) scheme.

doc	Exploring variations in the fundamental constants with ELTs: The CODEX spectrograph on OWL EOS Cosmological variations in the fine structure constant, alpha, can be probed through precise velocity measurements of metallic absorption lines from intervening gas clouds seen in spectra of distant quasars. EOS Data from the Keck/HIRES instrument support a variation in alpha of 6 parts per million. EOS Such a variation would have profound implications, possibly providing a window into the extra spatial dimensions required by unified theories such as string/M-theory. EOS However, recent results from VLT/UVES suggest no variation in alpha.	The COsmic Dynamics EXperiment (CODEX) spectrograph currently being designed for the ESO OWL telescope (Pasquini et al 2005) with a resolution high enough to properly resolve even the narrowest of metallic absorption lines, R>150,000, will achieve a 2-to-3 order-of-magnitude precision increase in Delta\alpha/alpha.
doc	A proposal for the geometry of W_n gravity EOS We relate the Teichmuller spaces obtained by Hitchin to the Teichmuller spaces of _EQN_ -gravity. EOS The relationship of this space to _EQN_ -gravity is obtained by identifying the flat _EQN_ connections of Hitchin to generalised vielbeins and connections. EOS This is explicitly demonstrated for _EQN_ gravity. EOS We show how _EQN_ -diffeomorphisms are obtained in this formulation. EOS We find that particular combinations of the generalised connection play the role of projective connections.	We thus obtain _EQN_ -diffeomorphisms in a geometric fashion without invoking the presence of matter fields.
doc	Extrinsic Rayleigh coefficient and domain mobility in critical MPB compositions of high-performance piezoceramics: A revisit EOS Enhanced domain mobility is considered as one of the important characteristics of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) ferroelectrics exhibiting a very large piezoelectric response. EOS For nearly two decades, Rayleigh analysis of dielectric and piezoelectric response at sub-coercive fields has been used as a phenomenological tool to determine the relative contribution of domain walls in influencing polar properties in these systems. EOS The high value of the extrinsic Rayleigh coefficient at the MPB is generally attributed to enhanced domain mobility.	Using coercive field as a measure of hindrance to domain mobility, in this paper, we have examined the correlation between the extrinsic Rayleigh coefficient, piezoelectric response, and coercive field (EC) by a comparative study on three different high performance piezoelectrics (i) (BaTi0.88Sn0.12)-(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3, (ii) Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and (iii) PbTiO3-BiScO3 across their respective MPBs.

doc	The direct cooling tail method for X-ray burst analysis to constrain neutron star masses and radii EOS Determining neutron star (NS) radii and masses can help to understand the properties of matter at supra-nuclear densities. EOS Thermal emission during thermonuclear X-ray bursts from NSs in low-mass X-ray binaries provides a unique opportunity to study NS parameters, because of the high fluxes, large luminosity variations and the related changes in the spectral properties. EOS The standard cooling tail method uses hot NS atmosphere models to convert the observed spectral evolution during cooling stages of X-ray bursts to the Eddington flux F_Edd and the stellar angular size \Omega.	These are then translated to the constraints on the NS mass M and radius R.

EOS We use a T-duality-shift-T-duality (TsT) transformation to obtain the beta-deformed background for real beta, and show that solutions of string theory equations of motion in this background are in one-to-one correspondence with those in AdS_5 x S^5 with twisted boundary conditions imposed on the U(1) isometry fields.	We then apply the TsT transformation to derive a local and periodic Lax pair for the bosonic part of string theory in the beta-deformed background.
doc	Optimal Surface Segmentation with Convex Priors in Irregularly Sampled Space EOS Optimal surface segmentation is a state-of-the-art method used for segmentation of multiple globally optimal surfaces in volumetric datasets. EOS The method is widely used in numerous medical image segmentation applications. EOS However, nodes in the graph based optimal surface segmentation method typically encode uniformly distributed orthogonal voxels of the volume. EOS Thus the segmentation cannot attain an accuracy greater than a single unit voxel, i.e. EOS the distance between two adjoining nodes in graph space. EOS Segmentation accuracy higher than a unit voxel is achievable by exploiting partial volume information in the voxels which shall result in non-equidistant spacing between adjoining graph nodes. EOS This paper reports a generalized graph based multiple surface segmentation method with convex priors which can optimally segment the target surfaces in an irregularly sampled space.	The proposed method allows non-equidistant spacing between the adjoining graph nodes to achieve subvoxel segmentation accuracy by utilizing the partial volume information in the voxels.

A case study in the G1 cryptocurrency EOS We study the interplay between social ties and financial transactions made through a recent cryptocurrency called _EQN_.

EOS This gives the opportunity to observe exactly who sent money to whom over a social network.	This social network is a key piece of this cryptocurrency, which therefore puts much effort in ensuring that nodes correspond to unique, well identified, real living human users, linked together only if they met at least once in real world.

doc	Self-energy of Heavy Quark EOS We demonstrate that to calculate the self-energy of a heavy quark in the heavy quark limit (or the heavy fermion limit in what is called the Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory), the use of standard dimensional regularization provides only the quantum limit: opposite to the heavy quark (or classical) limit that one wishes to obtain. EOS We thus devised a standard ultraviolet/infrared regularization procedure in calculating the one- and two-loop contributions to the heavy quark self-energy in this limit. EOS Then the one-loop result is shown to provide the standard classical Coulomb self-energy of a static colour source that is linearly proportional to the untraviolet cutoff _EQN_. EOS All the two-loop contributions are found to be proportional to _EQN_ where _EQN_ is the infrared cutoff.	Often only the contribution from the bubble (light quarks, gluon and ghost) insertion to the gluon propagator has been considered as the _EQN_ correction to the Coulomb energy to this order.

EOS It turns out that Petri's relations remarkably match in determinantal conditions.	We explicitly express the volume form on the moduli space M_g of canonical curves induced by the Siegel metric, in terms of the period Riemann matrix only.
doc	Search for Dark Matter Annihilation in Draco with STACEE EOS For some time, the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy has garnered interest as a possible source for the indirect detection of dark matter. EOS Its large mass-to-light ratio and relative proximity to the Earth provide favorable conditions for the production of detectable gamma rays from dark matter self-annihilation in its core. EOS The Solar Tower Atmospheric Cherenkov Effect Experiment (STACEE) is an air-shower Cherenkov telescope located in Albuquerque, NM capable of detecting gamma rays at energies above 100 GeV.	We present the results of the STACEE observations of Draco during the 2005-2006 observing season totaling 10 hours of livetime after cuts.

EOS A model independent way is adopted in the study by constructing the effective interaction operators between dark matter and standard model particles. EOS The most general 4-fermion operators are investigated.	We find that the constraints from different observations are complementary with each other.

EOS A sharp drop in the inverse sheet inductance, 1/L(T), is observed at a temperature, Tc, which lies below the mean-field transition temperature, Tco.	Just below Tc, the suppression of 1/L(T) below its mean-field value indicates that longitudinal phase fluctuations have nearly their full classical amplitude, but they disappear rapidly as T decreases.

Absence of any dependence of the spin relaxation time on the electron temperature and on the spin-exciton density, and specific dependence on the magnetic field indicate the definite relaxation mechanism -- spin-exciton annihilation mediated by spin-orbit coupling and smooth random potential.

Bound states of a gravitating test particle on 3D brane of 4D compactified space are studied by means of various approximate methods.
doc	Adiabatic hydrodynamics: The eightfold way to dissipation EOS We provide a complete solution to hydrodynamic transport at all orders in the gradient expansion compatible with the second law constraint. EOS The key new ingredient we introduce is the notion of adiabaticity, which allows us to take hydrodynamics off-shell. EOS Adiabatic fluids are such that off-shell dynamics of the fluid compensates for entropy production. EOS The space of adiabatic fluids is quite rich, and admits a decomposition into seven distinct classes. EOS Together with the dissipative class this establishes the eightfold way of hydrodynamic transport. EOS Furthermore, recent results guarantee that dissipative terms beyond leading order in the gradient expansion are agnostic of the second law. EOS While this completes a transport taxonomy, we go on to argue for a new symmetry principle, an Abelian gauge invariance that guarantees adiabaticity in hydrodynamics.	We suggest that this symmetry is the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic KMS invariance.

doc	An atomic resolution, single-spin magnetic resonance detection concept based on tunneling force microscopy EOS A comprehensive study of a force detected single-spin magnetic resonance measurement concept with atomic spatial resolution is presented. EOS The method is based upon electrostatic force detection of spin-selection rule controlled single-electron tunneling between two electrically isolated paramagnetic states. EOS Single spin magnetic resonance detection is possible by measuring the force detected tunneling charge noise on and off spin resonance. EOS Simulation results of this charge noise, based upon physical models of the tunneling and spin physics, are directly compared to measured AFM system noise.	The results show that the approach could provide single spin measurement of electrically isolated qubit states with atomic spatial resolution at room temperature.

EOS We also examine the usage patterns of chords and lyrics in different musical genres, historical eras, and geographical regions. EOS Our overall results confirms a previously known association between Major chords and positive valence. EOS We also report a wide variation in this association across regions, genres, and eras.	Our results suggest possible existence of different emotional associations for other types of chords.

EOS Combined with the archival data, we now have broadband observations of this remarkable source from six separate epochs. EOS Two of these new observations probe lower fluxes than seen previously, allowing us to extend our knowledge of the broadband spectral variability exhibited.	The spectra are well fit by two thermal blackbody components, which dominate the emission below 10 keV, as well as a steep (_EQN_) powerlaw tail which dominates above _EQN_ 15 keV.
doc	Design principles of apodized grating couplers EOS To optimize the coupling efficiency of grating couplers, we extend an analytical model for the design of apodized grating couplers, taking into account the constraints on the upper and lower bounds of the scattering strength as determined by fabrication technology. EOS We prove that our model gives the global optimum distribution of the scattering strength with the presence of such constraints. EOS We apply our model to the standard problem of coupling from a silicon chip to a single-mode fiber, as well as more complex problems including the coupling to a vortex beam, and the design of a focusing grating.	In the problem of coupling to a vortex beam, we validate our model with full-wave numerical simulations.

Of particular interest in this context is the ability to keep track of algebraic information (such as the gauge group) associated with individual vacua while dealing with statistics.

EOS The set of rop-words is not a subset of the set of Lyndon words, but is very closed. EOS We show that there is a bijection between some necklaces and rop-words. EOS This leads to a formula for counting the rop-words of a given length. EOS \textsc Keywords: Combinatoric on words.	Lyndon words.
doc	Aperture Increase Options for the Dutch Open Telescope EOS This paper is an invitation to the international community to participate in the usage and a substantial upgrade of the Dutch Open Telescope on La Palma (DOT, \url http://dot.astro.uu.nl). EOS We first give a brief overview of the approach, design, and current science capabilities of the DOT. EOS The DOT database (\url http://dotdb.phys.uu.nl/DOT) now contains many tomographic image sequences with 0.2-0.3 arcsec resolution and up to multi-hour duration. EOS You are welcome to pull them over for analysis. EOS The main part of this contribution outlines DOT upgrade designs implementing larger aperture. EOS The motivation for aperture increase is the recognition that optical solar physics needs the substantially larger telescope apertures that became useful with the advent of adaptive optics and viable through the DOT's open principle, both for photospheric polarimetry at high resolution and high sensitivity and for chromospheric fine-structure diagnosis at high cadence and full spectral sampling.	Realization of an upgrade requires external partnership(s).
doc	A subarcsecond resolution near-infrared study of Seyfert and `normal' galaxies: I. Imaging data EOS We present new high-resolution near-infrared observations in the J,H and K bands, obtained to study the properties of Seyfert host galaxies. EOS The dataset consists of images in the three bands of practically the entire CfA sample of Seyfert galaxies, and K-band images of a control sample of non-active, `normal', galaxies, matched to the Seyfert sample in the distribution of type and inclination. EOS The spatial resolution and sampling of the new images is a factor 2 better than previously published K-band data. EOS In this paper, we present the data in the form of profiles of surface brightness and color, ellipticity and major axis position angle, as well as greyscale maps of surface brightness in H or K and both J-H and H-K colors.	We compare our surface brightness and color profiles with the literature, and find good agreement.
doc	On Computing the Number of Short Cycles in Bipartite Graphs Using the Spectrum of the Directed Edge Matrix EOS Counting short cycles in bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem of interest in many fields including the analysis and design of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. EOS There are two computational approaches to count short cycles (with length smaller than _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the girth of the graph) in bipartite graphs. EOS The first approach is applicable to a general (irregular) bipartite graph, and uses the spectrum _EQN_ of the directed edge matrix of the graph to compute the multiplicity _EQN_ of _EQN_ -cycles with _EQN_ through the simple equation _EQN_. EOS This approach has a computational complexity _EQN_, where _EQN_ is number of edges in the graph. EOS The second approach is only applicable to bi-regular bipartite graphs, and uses the spectrum _EQN_ of the adjacency matrix (graph spectrum) and the degree sequences of the graph to compute _EQN_. EOS The complexity of this approach is _EQN_, where _EQN_ is number of nodes in the graph. EOS This complexity is less than that of the first approach, but the equations involved in the computations of the second approach are very tedious, particularly for _EQN_. EOS In this paper, we establish an analytical relationship between the two spectra _EQN_ and _EQN_ for bi-regular bipartite graphs.	Through this relationship, the former spectrum can be derived from the latter through simple equations.
doc	Mixing of fermion fields of opposite parities and baryon resonances EOS We consider a loop mixing of two fermion fields of opposite parities whereas the parity is conserved in a Lagrangian. EOS Such kind of mixing is specific for fermions and has no analogy in boson case. EOS Possible applications of this effect may be related with physics of baryon resonances. EOS The obtained matrix propagator defines a pair of unitary partial amplitudes which describe the production of resonances of spin _EQN_ and different parity _EQN_ or _EQN_. EOS The use of our amplitudes for joint description of _EQN_ partial waves _EQN_ and _EQN_ shows that the discussed effect is clearly seen in these partial waves as the specific form of interference between resonance and background.	Another interesting application of this effect may be a pair of partial waves _EQN_ and _EQN_ where the picture is more complicated due to presence of several resonance states.
doc	Odd values of the Klein j-function and the cubic partition function EOS In this note, using entirely algebraic or elementary methods, we determine a new asymptotic lower bound for the number of odd values of one of the most important modular functions in number theory, the Klein _EQN_ -function. EOS Namely, we show that the number of integers _EQN_ such that the Klein _EQN_ -function --- or equivalently, the cubic partition function --- is odd is at least of the order of _EQN_ for _EQN_ large. EOS This improves recent results of Berndt-Yee-Zaharescu and Chen-Lin, and approaches significantly the best lower bound currently known for the ordinary partition function, obtained using the theory of modular forms.	Unlike many works in this area, our techniques to show the above result, that have in part been inspired by some recent ideas of P.

doc	Hot prominence spicules launched from turbulent cool solar prominences EOS A solar filament is a dense cool condensation that is supported and thermally insulated by magnetic fields in the rarefied hot corona. EOS Its evolution and stability, leading to either an eruption or disappearance, depend on its coupling with the surrounding hot corona through a thin transition region, where the temperature steeply rises. EOS However, the heating and dynamics of this transition region remain elusive. EOS We report extreme-ultraviolet observations of quiescent filaments from the Solar Dynamics Observatory that reveal prominence spicules propagating through the transition region of the filament-corona system. EOS These thin needle-like jet features are generated and heated to at least 0.7 MK by turbulent motions of the material in the filament. EOS We suggest that the prominence spicules continuously channel the heated mass into the corona and aid in the filament evaporation and decay.	Our results shed light on the turbulence-driven heating in magnetized condensations that are commonly observed on the Sun and in the interstellar medium.

doc	Prediction of Dst during solar minimum using in situ measurements at L5 EOS Geomagnetic storms resulting from high-speed streams can have significant negative impacts on modern infrastructure due to complex interactions between the solar wind and geomagnetic field. EOS One measure of the extent of this effect is the Kyoto _EQN_ index. EOS We present a method to predict _EQN_ from data measured at the Lagrange 5 (L5) point, which allows for forecasts of solar wind development 4.5 days in advance of the stream reaching the Earth.	Using the STEREO-B satellite as a proxy, we map data measured near L5 to the near-Earth environment and make a prediction of the _EQN_ from this point using the Temerin-Li _EQN_ model enhanced from the original using a machine learning approach.

doc	Dark Gamma Ray Bursts EOS Many theories of dark matter (DM) predict that DM particles can be captured by stars via scattering on ordinary matter. EOS They subsequently condense into a DM core close to the center of the star and eventually annihilate. EOS In this work, we trace DM capture and annihilation rates throughout the life of a massive star and show that this evolution culminates in an intense annihilation burst coincident with the death of the star in a core collapse supernova.	The reason is that, along with the stellar interior, also its DM core heats up and contracts, so that the DM density increases rapidly during the final stages of stellar evolution.
doc	Determination of |Vub| in inclusive semileptonic B meson decays EOS We present a preliminary determination of the CKM matrix element |Vub| based on the analysis of semileptonic B decays from a sample of 88 million Upsilon(4S) decays collected with the BaBar detector at the e+e- storage ring. EOS Charmless semileptonic B decays are selected using the electron energy E_e and the invariant mass q^2 of the electron-neutrino pair. EOS The neutrino momentum is inferred from a measurement of the visible energy and momentum in the detector and knowledge of the e+e- beam momenta. EOS The partial branching fraction is determined in a region of the q^2-E_e plane where semileptonic B decays to charm are highly suppressed. EOS The total charmless semileptonic branching fraction is extracted using a theoretical calculation based on the heavy quark expansion.	Preliminary results yield |Vub| = (4.57 +/- 0.21 +/- 0.25 +/- 0.34 +0.59/-0.29 +/- 0.22) x 10^ -3 where the uncertainties are from statistics (data and MC), detector modeling, background modeling, the shape function, and the heavy quark operator product expansion, respectively.

EOS We then relate this surface gravity to a physical notion of temperature, and show this has constant, positive sign for any kind of past-inner trapping horizons.	Hopefully this will clarify the choice of temperature in a dynamical Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberston-Walker spacetime.

doc	Bayesian nonparametric modeling for mean residual life regression EOS The mean residual life function is a key functional for a survival distribution. EOS It has practically useful interpretation as the expected remaining lifetime given survival up to a particular time point, and it also characterizes the survival distribution. EOS However, it has received limited attention in terms of inference methods under a probabilistic modeling framework. EOS In this paper, we seek to provide general inference methodology for mean residual life regression.	Survival data often include a set of predictor variables for the survival response distribution, and in many cases it is natural to include the covariates as random variables into the modeling.

doc	The UV galaxy luminosity function at z=3-5 from the CFHT Legacy Survey Deep fields EOS We measure and study the evolution of the UV galaxy Luminosity Function (LF) at z=3-5 from the largest high-redshift survey to date, the Deep part of the CFHT Legacy Survey. EOS We also give accurate estimates of the SFR density at these redshifts. EOS We consider ~100,000 Lyman-break galaxies at z~3.1, 3.8 & 4.8 selected from very deep ugriz images of this data set and estimate their rest-frame 1600A luminosity function. EOS Due to the large survey volume, cosmic variance plays a negligible role. EOS Furthermore, we measure the bright end of the LF with unprecedented statistical accuracy. EOS Contamination fractions from stars and low-z galaxy interlopers are estimated from simulations. EOS To correct for incompleteness, we study the detection rate of simulated galaxies injected to the images as a function of magnitude and redshift. EOS We estimate the contribution of several systematic effects in the analysis to test the robustness of our results. EOS We find the bright end of the LF of our u-dropout sample to deviate significantly from a Schechter function. EOS If we modify the function by a recently proposed magnification model, the fit improves. EOS For the first time in an LBG sample, we can measure down to the density regime where magnification affects the shape of the observed LF because of the very bright and rare galaxies we are able to probe with this data set. EOS We find an increase in the normalisation, _EQN_, of the LF by a factor of 2.5 between z~5 and z~3.	The faint-end slope of the LF does not evolve significantly between z~5 and z~3.

doc	The Applied Pi Calculus: Mobile Values, New Names, and Secure Communication EOS We study the interaction of the programming construct "new", which generates statically scoped names, with communication via messages on channels. EOS This interaction is crucial in security protocols, which are the main motivating examples for our work, it also appears in other programming-language contexts. EOS We define the applied pi calculus, a simple, general extension of the pi calculus in which values can be formed from names via the application of built-in functions, subject to equations, and be sent as messages. EOS (In contrast, the pure pi calculus lacks built-in functions, its only messages are atomic names.) We develop semantics and proof techniques for this extended language and apply them in reasoning about security protocols. EOS This paper essentially subsumes the conference paper that introduced the applied pi calculus in 2001. EOS It fills gaps, incorporates improvements, and further explains and studies the applied pi calculus. EOS Since 2001, the applied pi calculus has been the basis for much further work, described in many research publications and sometimes embodied in useful software, such as the tool ProVerif, which relies on the applied pi calculus to support the specification and automatic analysis of security protocols. EOS Although this paper does not aim to be a complete review of the subject, it benefits from that further work and provides better foundations for some of it.	In particular, the applied pi calculus has evolved through its implementation in ProVerif, and the present definition reflects that evolution.
doc	Angular Symmetry Breaking Induced by Electromagnetic Field EOS It is well known that velocities does not commute in presence of an electromagnetic field. EOS This property implies that angular algebra symmetries, such as the sO(3) and Lorentz algebra symmetries, are broken.	To restore these angular symmetries we show the necessity of adding the Poincare momentum M to the simple angular momentum L.

doc	Experimental entanglement distribution by separable states EOS The distribution of entanglement between macroscopically separated parties represents a crucial protocol for future quantum information networks. EOS Surprisingly, it has been theoretically shown that two distant systems can be entangled by sending a third mediating system that is not entangled with either of them. EOS Such a possibility seems to contradict the intuition that to distribute entanglement, the transmitted system always needs to be entangled with the sender. EOS Here, we experimentally distribute entanglement by exchanging a subsystem and successfully prove that this subsystem is not entangled with either of the two parties. EOS Our implementation relies on the preparation of a specific three-mode Gaussian state containing thermal noise that demolishes the entanglement in two of the three bipartite splittings.	After transmission of a separable mode this noise can be removed by quantum interference.

In the experiment, a femtosecond laser pulse induces a sudden, nonequilibrium increase in magnetic disorder.
doc	The Value of Progenitor Radius Measurements for Explosion Modeling of Type II-Plateau Supernovae EOS Using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)+STELLA, we show that very different physical models can adequately reproduce a specific observed Type II-Plateau Supernova (SN).	We consider SN2004A, SN2004et, SN2009ib, SN2017eaw, and SN2017gmr, Nickel-rich (_EQN_) events with bolometric lightcurves and a well-sampled decline from the plateau.
doc	Half-Semiconductor antiferromagnets and Spin-Gapless-Semiconductor antiferromagnets EOS We propose a concept of half-semiconductor antiferromagnets in which both spin-polarized valence and conduction bands belong to the same spin channel with completely compensated spontaneous magnetization.	Using density functional theory plus Hubbard U (DFT+U) methods, we find a viable approach to achieve the half-semiconductor antiferromagnets through the transition metal (TM) Fe and Cr codoped boron nitride(BN) sheet.
doc	Qualitative properties of systems of 2 complex homogeneous ODE's: a connection to polygonal billiards EOS A correspondence between the orbits of a system of 2 complex, homogeneous, polynomial ordinary differential equations with real coefficients and those of a polygonal billiard is displayed. EOS This correspondence is general, in the sense that it applies to an open set of systems of ordinary differential equations of the specified kind.	This allows to transfer results well-known from the theory of polygonal billiards, such as ergodicity, the existence of periodic orbits, the absence of exponential divergence, the existence of additional conservation laws, and the presence of discontinuities in the dynamics, to the corresponding systems of ordinary differential equations.
doc	Algebraic arctic curves in the domain-wall six-vertex model EOS The arctic curve, i.e. EOS the spatial curve separating ordered (or `frozen') and disordered (or `temperate) regions, of the six-vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions is discussed for the root-of-unity vertex weights.	In these cases the curve is described by algebraic equations which can be worked out explicitly from the parametric solution for this curve.
doc	Form factor expansion for large graphs: a diagrammatic approach EOS The form factor of a quantum graph is a function measuring correlations within the spectrum of the graph. EOS It can be expressed as a double sum over the periodic orbits on the graph.	We propose a scheme which allows one to evaluate the periodic orbit sum for a special family of graphs and thus to recover the expression for the form factor predicted by the Random Matrix Theory.
doc	Time-Optimal Construction of Overlay Networks EOS We show how to construct an overlay network of constant degree and diameter _EQN_ in time _EQN_ starting from an arbitrary weakly connected graph. EOS We assume a synchronous communication network in which nodes can send messages to nodes they know the identifier of, and new connections can be established by sending node identifiers. EOS If the initial network's graph is weakly connected and has constant degree, then our algorithm constructs the desired topology with each node sending and receiving only _EQN_ messages in each round in time _EQN_, w.h.p., which beats the currently best _EQN_ time algorithm of [G\"otte et al, SIROCCO'19].	Since the problem cannot be solved faster than by using pointer jumping for _EQN_ rounds (which would even require each node to communicate _EQN_ bits), our algorithm is asymptotically optimal.

It has drawn extensive attention to improve traffic safety and efficiency and create a more comfortable driving and riding environment.
doc	Systematic construction of density functionals based on matrix product state computations EOS We propose a systematic procedure for the approximation of density functionals in density functional theory that consists of two parts. EOS First, for the efficient approximation of a general density functional, we introduce an efficient ansatz whose non-locality can be increased systematically. EOS Second, we present a fitting strategy that is based on systematically increasing a reasonably chosen set of training densities. EOS We investigate our procedure in the context of strongly correlated fermions on a one-dimensional lattice in which we compute accurate training densities with the help of matrix product states.	Focusing on the exchange-correlation energy, we demonstrate how an efficient approximation can be found that includes and systematically improves beyond the local density approximation.
doc	A stable and optimally convergent LaTIn-Cut Finite Element Method for multiple unilateral contact problems EOS In this paper, we propose a novel unfitted finite element method for the simulation of multiple body contact.

doc	Multiscale Nakagami parametric imaging for improved liver tumor localization EOS Effective ultrasound tissue characterization is usually hindered by complex tissue structures. EOS The interlacing of speckle patterns complicates the correct estimation of backscatter distribution parameters. EOS Nakagami parametric imaging based on localized shape parameter mapping can model different backscattering conditions. EOS However, performance of the constructed Nakagami image depends on the sensitivity of the estimation method to the backscattered statistics and scale of analysis. EOS Using a fixed focal region of interest in estimating the Nakagami parametric image would increase estimation variance. EOS In this work, localized Nakagami parameters are estimated adaptively by means of maximum likelihood estimation on a multiscale basis.	The varying size kernel integrates the goodness-of-fit of the backscattering distribution parameters at multiple scales for more stable parameter estimation.
doc	Distributed Power Control Network and Green Building Test-bed for Demand Response in Smart Grid EOS It is known that demand and supply power balancing is an essential method to operate power delivery system and prevent blackouts caused by power shortage. EOS In this paper, we focus on the implementation of demand response strategy to save power during peak hours by using Smart Grid. EOS It is obviously impractical with centralized power control network to realize the real-time control performance, where a single central controller measures the huge metering data and sends control command back to all customers. EOS For that purpose, we propose a new architecture of hierarchical distributed power control network which is scalable regardless of the network size. EOS The sub-controllers are introduced to partition the large system into smaller distributed clusters where low-latency local feedback power control loops are conducted to guarantee control stability. EOS Furthermore, sub-controllers are stacked up in an hierarchical manner such that data are fed back layer-by-layer in the inbound while in the outbound control responses are decentralized in each local sub-controller for realizing the global objectives.	Numerical simulations in a realistic scenario of up to 5000 consumers show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme to achieve a desired 10% peak power saving by using off-the-shelf wireless devices with IEEE802.15.4g standard.
doc	Realization of Semiconducting Layered Multiferroic Heterojunctions via Asymmetrical Magnetoelectric Coupling EOS Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting multiferroics that can effectively couple magnetic and polarization (P) orders have great interest for both fundamental research and technological applications in nanoscale, which are, however, rare in nature. EOS In this study, we propose a general mechanism to realize semiconducting 2D multiferroics via vdW heterojunction engineering, as demonstrated in a typical heterostructure consisting of magnetic bilayer CrI3 (bi-CrI3) and ferroelectric monolayer In2Se3. EOS Interestingly, the novel indirect orbital coupling between Se 4p and Cr 3d orbitals, intermediated by the interfacial I 5p orbitals, are switchable in the opposite P configurations, resulting in an unexpected mechanism of strong asymmetrical magnetoelectric coupling.	Therefore, along with the noticeable ferroelectric energy barrier induced by In2Se3, the realization of opposite magnetic orders in opposite P configurations can eventually result in the novel multiferroicity in bi-CrI3/In2Se3.
doc	Problems with wormholes which involve arbitrarily small amounts of exotic matter EOS A quantum inequality bound on the expectation value of the null-contracted stress tensor in an arbitrary Hadamard state is used to obtain constraints on the geometries of traversable wormholes. EOS Particular attention is given to the wormhole models of Visser, Kar, and Dadhich (VKD) and to those of Kuhfittig. EOS These are models which use arbitrarily small amounts of exotic matter for wormhole maintenance.	It is shown that macroscopic VKD models are either ruled out or severely constrained, while a recent model of Kuhfittig is shown to be, in fact, non-traversable.
doc	Singularly Perturbed Boundary-Focus Bifurcations EOS We consider smooth systems limiting as _EQN_ to piecewise-smooth (PWS) systems with a boundary-focus (BF) bifurcation. EOS After deriving a suitable local normal form, we study the dynamics for the smooth system with _EQN_ using a combination of geometric singular perturbation theory and blow-up. EOS We show that the type of BF bifurcation in the PWS system determines the bifurcation structure for the smooth system within an _EQN_ dependent domain which shrinks to zero as _EQN_, identifying a supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation in one case, and a supercritical Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation in two other cases. EOS We also show that PWS cycles associated with BF bifurcations persist as relaxation cycles in the smooth system, and prove existence of a family of stable limit cycles which connects the relaxation cycles to regular cycles within the _EQN_ dependent domain described above.	Our results are applied to models for Gause predator-prey interaction and mechanical oscillation subject to friction.
doc	Use of the chemical potential for a limited number of fermions with a degenerate groundstate EOS For fermions with degenerate single-particle energy levels, the usual relation between the total number of particles and the chemical potential _EQN_ is only satisfied for a specific number of particles, i.e. EOS those leading to closed shells. EOS The treatment of an arbitrary number of fermions requires a modification of the chemical potential, similar to the one proposed by Landsberg for Bose-condensed systems. EOS We study the implications of the required modification for fermions in a potential, by calculating the ground state energy, the free energy, the density, the partition function and the dynamic two-point correlation function.	It turns out that the modified relation between the fugacity and the number of particles leads to the correct ground state energy and density.
doc	Half-filled Landau level as a Fermi liquid of dipolar quasiparticles	In this paper we study the relation between the conventional Fermion-Chern-Simons (FCS) theory of the half-filled Landau level (nu=1/2), and alternate descriptions that are based on the notion of neutral quasi-particles that carry electric dipole moments.
doc	Quasi-Static SIMO Fading Channels at Finite Blocklength EOS We investigate the maximal achievable rate for a given blocklength and error probability over quasi-static single-input multiple-output (SIMO) fading channels. EOS Under mild conditions on the channel gains, it is shown that the channel dispersion is zero regardless of whether the fading realizations are available at the transmitter and/or the receiver. EOS The result follows from computationally and analytically tractable converse and achievability bounds. EOS Through numerical evaluation, we verify that, in some scenarios, zero dispersion indeed entails fast convergence to outage capacity as the blocklength increases.	In the example of a particular 1*2 SIMO Rician channel, the blocklength required to achieve 90% of capacity is about an order of magnitude smaller compared to the blocklength required for an AWGN channel with the same capacity.
doc	Proposal for a CFT interpretation of Watts' differential equation for percolation EOS G. EOS M. EOS T. EOS Watts derived that in two dimensional critical percolation the crossing probability Pi_hv satisfies a fifth order differential equation which includes another one of third order whose independent solutions describe the physically relevant quantities 1, Pi_h, Pi_hv.	We will show that this differential equation can be derived from a level three null vector condition of a rational c=-24 CFT and motivate how this solution may be fitted into known properties of percolation.
doc	Na-O Anticorrelation and HB. VI. The chemical composition of the peculiar bulge globular cluster NGC 6388 EOS We present the LTE abundance analysis of high resolution spectra for red giant stars in the peculiar bulge globular cluster NGC 6388. EOS Spectra of seven members were taken using the UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT2 and the multiobject FLAMES facility. EOS We exclude any intrinsic metallicity spread in this cluster: on average, [Fe/H]=-0.44+/-0.01+/-0.03 dex on the scale of the present series of papers, where the first error bar refers to individual star-to-star errors and the second is systematic, relative to the cluster. EOS Elements involved in H-burning at high temperatures show large spreads, exceeding the estimated errors in the analysis. EOS In particular, the pairs Na and O, Al and Mg are anticorrelated and Na and Al are correlated among the giants in NGC 6388, the typical pattern observed in all galactic globular clusters studied so far.	Stars in NGC 6388 shows an excess of alpha-process elements, similar to the one found in the twin bulge cluster NGC 6441.
doc	L1521E: the first starless core with no molecular depletion EOS L1521E seems unique among starless cores. EOS It stands out in a distribution of a ratio (R) that we define to asses core evolution, and which compares the emission of the easily-depleted C18O molecule with that of the hard to deplete, late-time species N2H+. EOS While all cores we have studied so far have R ratio lower than 1, L1521E has an R value of 3.4, which is 8 times the mean of the other cores. EOS To understand this difference, we have modeled the C18O and N2H+ abundance profiles in L1521E using a density distribution derived from 1.2mm continuum data. EOS Our model shows that the C18O emission in this core is consistent with constant abundance, and this makes L1521E the first core with no C18O depletion.	Our model also derives an unusually low N2H+ abundance.
doc	AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds. III. The rate of star formation across the SMC EOS This article compares the Ks magnitude distribution of Small Magellanic Cloud asymptotic giant branch stars obtained from the DENIS and 2MASS data with theoretical distributions. EOS Theoretical Ks magnitude distributions have been constructed using up-to-date stellar evolution calculations for low and intermediate-mass stars, and in particular for thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars. EOS Separate fits of the magnitude distributions of carbon- and oxygen-rich stars allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution across the galaxy and its star formation rate. EOS The Small Magellanic Cloud stellar population is found to be on average 7-9 Gyr old but older stars are present at its periphery and younger stars are present in the direction of the companion galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud. EOS The metallicity distribution traces a ring-like structure that is more metal rich than the inner region of the galaxy.	The C/M ratio discussed in Paper I is a tracer of the metallicity distribution only if the underlying stellar population is of intermediate-age.
doc	Fast Free-text Authentication via Instance-based Keystroke Dynamics EOS Keystroke dynamics study the way in which users input text via their keyboards. EOS Having the ability to differentiate users, typing behaviors can unobtrusively form a component of a behavioral biometric recognition system to improve existing account security. EOS Keystroke dynamics systems on free-text data have previously required 500 or more characters to achieve reasonable performance. EOS In this paper, we propose a novel instance-based graph comparison algorithm called the instance-based tail area density (ITAD) metric to reduce the number of keystrokes required to authenticate users. EOS Additionally, commonly used features in the keystroke dynamics literature, such as monographs and digraphs, are all found to be useful in informing who is typing.	The usefulness of these features for authentication is determined using a random forest classifier and validated across two publicly available datasets.

EOS For both methods, the room acoustics are modeled using a nonnegative approximation of the convolutive transfer function (NCTF), and to additionally exploit the spectral properties of the speech signal, such as the low rank nature of the speech spectrogram, the speech spectrogram is modeled using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF).	Two methods are described to combine the NCTF and NMF models.

doc	On the Robustness and Scalability of Semidefinite Relaxation for Optimal Power Flow Problems EOS Semidefinite relaxation techniques have shown great promise for nonconvex optimal power flow problems. EOS However, a number of independent numerical experiments have led to concerns about scalability and robustness of existing SDP solvers. EOS To address these concerns, we investigate some numerical aspects of the problem and compare different state-of-the-art solvers. EOS Our results demonstrate that semidefinite relaxations of large problem instances with on the order of 10,000 buses can be solved reliably and to reasonable accuracy within minutes. EOS Furthermore, the semidefinite relaxation of a test case with 25,000 buses can be solved reliably within half an hour; EOS the largest test case with 82,000 buses is solved within eight hours.	We also compare the lower bound obtained via semidefinite relaxation to locally optimal solutions obtained with nonlinear optimization methods and calculate the optimality gap.
doc	Preparation and tunable mid-IR optical properties of ternary Cd_ 1-x Pb_xS nanocrystals by mechanical alloying EOS Composition-tunable ternary Cd1-xPbxS nanocrystals (NCs) are very important materials for remote sensing and detecting in the infrared (IR) wavelength region. EOS They are, however, almost exclusively prepared by wet chemical routes which leads to surface-capped nanoparticles. EOS The surface capping molecules could move their absorption peak from mid-IR to near IR wavelength region.	However, surface clean Cd1-xPbxS nanocrystals (NCs) would demonstrate intrinsic optical spectrum in the mid-IR region.
doc	Fixed parameter tractable algorithms in combinatorial topology EOS To enumerate 3-manifold triangulations with a given property, one typically begins with a set of potential face pairing graphs (also known as dual 1-skeletons), and then attempts to flesh each graph out into full triangulations using an exponential-time enumeration. EOS However, asymptotically most graphs do not result in any 3-manifold triangulation, which leads to significant "wasted time" in topological enumeration algorithms. EOS Here we give a new algorithm to determine whether a given face pairing graph supports any 3-manifold triangulation, and show this to be fixed parameter tractable in the treewidth of the graph. EOS We extend this result to a "meta-theorem" by defining a broad class of properties of triangulations, each with a corresponding fixed parameter tractable existence algorithm.	We explicitly implement this algorithm in the most generic setting, and we identify heuristics that in practice are seen to mitigate the large constants that so often occur in parameterised complexity, highlighting the practicality of our techniques.
doc	Positivity of the height jump divisor EOS We study the degeneration of semipositive smooth hermitian line bundles on open complex manifolds, assuming that the metric extends well away from a codimension two analytic subset of the boundary. EOS Using terminology introduced by R. EOS Hain, we show that under these assumptions the so-called height jump divisors are always effective. EOS This result is of particular interest in the context of biextension line bundles on Griffiths intermediate jacobian fibrations of polarized variations of Hodge structure of weight -1, pulled back along normal function sections.	In the case of the normal function on M_g associated to the Ceresa cycle, our result proves a conjecture of Hain.
doc	Noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in 5d pyrochlore oxide Cd2Os2O7 EOS We investigated the electronic and magnetic properties of the pyrochlore oxide Cd _EQN_ Os _EQN_ O _EQN_ using the density-functional theory plus on-site repulsion (_EQN_) method, and depict the ground-state phase diagram with respect to _EQN_. EOS We conclude that the all-in/all-out non-collinear magnetic order is stable in a wide range of _EQN_. EOS We also show that the easy-axis anisotropy arising from the spin-orbit (SO) coupling plays a significant role in stabilizing the all-in/all-out magnetic order.	A \textit pseudo gap was observed near the transition between the antiferromagnetic metallic and insulating phases.
doc	Spanning trees and Khovanov homology EOS The Jones polynomial can be expressed in terms of spanning trees of the graph obtained by checkerboard coloring a knot diagram. EOS We show there exists a complex generated by these spanning trees whose homology is the reduced Khovanov homology. EOS The spanning trees provide a filtration on the reduced Khovanov complex and a spectral sequence that converges to its homology. EOS For alternating links, all differentials on the spanning tree complex are zero and the reduced Khovanov homology is determined by the Jones polynomial and signature.	We prove some analogous theorems for (unreduced) Khovanov homology.
doc	Classical electrodynamics of point charges EOS A simple mathematical procedure is introduced which allows redefining in an exact way divergent integrals and limits that appear in the basic equations of classical electrodynamics with point charges. EOS In this way all divergences are at once removed without affecting the locality and the relativistic covariance of the theory, and with no need for mass renormalization. EOS The procedure is first used to obtain a finite expression for the electromagnetic energy-momentum of the system. EOS We show that the relativistic Lorentz-Dirac equation can be deduced from the conservation of this electromagnetic energy-momentum plus the usual mechanical term. EOS Then we derive a finite lagrangian, which depends on the particle variables and on the actual electromagnetic potentials at a given time. EOS From this lagrangian the equations of motion of both particles and fields can be derived via Hamilton's variational principle.	The hamiltonian formulation of the theory can be obtained in a straightforward way.

doc	Texture Classification of MR Images of the Brain in ALS using CoHOG EOS Texture analysis is a well-known research topic in computer vision and image processing and has many applications. EOS Gradient-based texture methods have become popular in classification problems. EOS For the first time we extend a well-known gradient-based method, Co-occurrence Histograms of Oriented Gradients (CoHOG) to extract texture features from 2D Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). EOS Unlike the original CoHOG method, we use the whole image instead of sub-regions for feature calculation. EOS Also, we use a larger neighborhood size. EOS Gradient orientations of the image pixels are calculated using Sobel, Gaussian Derivative (GD) and Local Frequency Descriptor Gradient (LFDG) operators.	The extracted feature vector size is very large and classification using a large number of similar features does not provide the best results.
doc	A Derivation of the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes Model for Aerosol Flows from Kinetic Theory EOS This article proposes a derivation of the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system for spray/aerosol flows. EOS The distribution function of the dispersed phase is governed by a Vlasov-equation, while the velocity field of the propellant satisfies the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids.	The dynamics of the dispersed phase and of the propellant are coupled through the drag force exerted by the propellant on the dispersed phase.
doc	Benchmarking cross-project defect prediction approaches with costs metrics EOS Defect prediction can be a powerful tool to guide the use of quality assurance resources. EOS In recent years, many researchers focused on the problem of Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP), i.e., the creation of prediction models based on training data from other projects. EOS However, only few of the published papers evaluate the cost efficiency of predictions, i.e., if they save costs if they are used to guide quality assurance efforts. EOS Within this paper, we provide a benchmark of 26 CPDP approaches based on cost metrics. EOS Our benchmark shows that trivially assuming everything as defective is on average better than CPDP under cost considerations. EOS Moreover, we show that our ranking of approaches using cost metrics is uncorrelated to a ranking based on metrics that do not directly consider costs.	These findings show that we must put more effort into evaluating the actual benefits of CPDP, as the current state of the art of CPDP can actually be beaten by a trivial approach in cost-oriented evaluations.

doc	Exploring the astrophysics of dark atoms EOS A component of the dark matter could consist of two darkly charged particles with a large mass ratio and a massless force carrier. EOS This `atomic' dark sector could behave much like the baryonic sector, cooling and fragmenting down to stellar-mass or smaller scales. EOS Past studies have shown that cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure constraints rule out _EQN_ of the dark matter to behave in this manner. EOS However, we show that, even with percent level mass fractions, a dark atomic sector could affect some extragalactic and galactic observables. EOS We track the cooling and merger history of an atomic dark component for much of the interesting parameter space. EOS Unlike the baryons, where stellar feedback (driven by nuclear physics) delays the formation and growth of galaxies, cooling dark atomic gas typically results in disks forming earlier, leaving more time for their destruction via mergers. EOS Rather than disks in Milky Way sized halos, we find the end product is typically spheroidal structures on galactic scales or dark atom fragments distributed on halo scales. EOS This result contrasts with previous studies, which had assumed that the dark atoms would result in dark disks.	Furthermore the dark atoms condense into dense clumps, analogous to how the baryons fragment on solar-mass scales.
doc	Dynamics of kaons in nuclear matter EOS We consider _EQN_ nucleon elastic and inelastic scattering in isospin symmetric nuclear matter. EOS It is found that the proper description of the _EQN_ resonance structure in nuclear matter requires a self-consistent approach. EOS Then the _EQN_ resonance mass remains basically unchanged, however, the resonance acquires an increased decay width as nuclear matter is compressed. EOS The elastic and inelastic scattering amplitudes show important medium modifications close to the kaon nucleon threshold. EOS We also construct the _EQN_ -nuclear optical potential appropriate for _EQN_ atoms.	Our microscopic approach predicts a strong attractive non-local interaction strength.

If _EQN_ is the first integer such that the local cohomology module _EQN_ is non _EQN_ -cofinite, then we show that _EQN_ is finite.

doc	High-threshold fault-tolerant quantum computation with the GKP qubit and realistically noisy devices EOS To implement fault-tolerant quantum computation with continuous variables, continuous variables need to be digitized using an appropriate code such as the Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) qubit. EOS We have developed a method to alleviate the required squeezing level to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation with the GKP qubit [K. EOS Fukui, A. EOS Tomita, A. EOS Okamoto, and K. EOS Fujii, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS X 8, 021054 (2018)]. EOS In the previous work, the required squeezing level can be reduced to less than 10 dB, assuming a noise derived from only the deviation of the GKP qubit itself. EOS Considering realistic devices such as the two-qubit gate and the homodyne measurement, however, there is some additional noise, which leads to the degradation of the squeezing level. EOS Specifically, the required squeezing level degrades to 15.0 dB, assuming the transmission loss in the homodyne measurement 5 _EQN_ and the imperfection of the two-qubit gate.	In this work, we propose a scheme to improve the required squeezing level, combining the previous schemes with the proposed maximum-likelihood methods and encoded measurements.
doc	The morphology-density relation of galaxies around MACSJ0717.5+3745 EOS We use an 18' x 9' mosaic of ACS images covering the entire large-scale structure around the X-ray luminous cluster MACSJ0717.5 (z=0.545) to study the morphology of galaxies at the cluster redshift. EOS We find the global fraction of morphological types of galaxies to be consistent with results in the literature. EOS Interestingly, we find that the fraction of S0s also correlates with local galaxy density, in contrast to the findings of a study of the cores of 10 clusters at similar redshift by Dressler et al We suggest that this apparent inconsistency is due to differences in the spatial coverage around clusters, which is supported by the fact that the correlation disappears for S0s within a radius of 0.6R_200 of MACSJ0717.	We interpret this result as evidence of the morphology-density relation being caused by a combination of morphological transformation triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions, and effects related to the formation and evolution of large-scale structure.
doc	Multi-walker discrete time quantum walks on arbitrary graphs, their properties, and their photonic implementation EOS Quantum walks have emerged as an interesting alternative to the usual circuit model for quantum computing. EOS While still universal for quantum computing, the quantum walk model has very different physical requirements, which lends itself more naturally to some physical implementations, such as linear optics. EOS Numerous authors have considered walks with one or two walkers, on one dimensional graphs, and several experimental demonstrations have been performed. EOS In this paper we discuss generalizing the model of discrete time quantum walks to the case of an arbitrary number of walkers acting on arbitrary graph structures.	We present a formalism which allows for analysis of such situations, and several example scenarios for how our techniques can be applied.
doc	Thermographic Laplacian-pyramid filtering to enhance delamination detection in concrete structure EOS Despite decades of efforts using thermography to detect delamination in concrete decks, challenges still exist in removing environmental noise from thermal images. EOS The performance of conventional temperature-contrast approaches can be significantly limited by environment-induced non-uniform temperature distribution across imaging spaces. EOS Time-series based methodologies were found robust to spatial temperature non-uniformity but require the extended period to collect data. EOS A new empirical image filtering method is introduced in this paper to enhance the delamination detection using blob detection method that originated from computer vision. EOS The proposed method employs a Laplacian of Gaussian filter to achieve multi-scale detection of abnormal thermal patterns by delaminated areas. EOS Results were compared with the state-of-the-art methods and benchmarked with time-series methods in the case of handling the non-uniform heat distribution issue. EOS To further evaluate the performance of the method numerical simulations using transient heat transfer models were used to generate the 'theoretical' noise-free thermal images for comparison. EOS Significant performance improvement was found compared to the conventional methods in both indoor and outdoor tests.	This methodology proved to be capable to detect multi-size delamination using a single thermal image.

For descriptive statistical problems such as estimating the N-gram entropy of English language text, a common approach is to use as much data as possible to obtain progressively more accurate estimates.
doc	Word Searching in Scene Image and Video Frame in Multi-Script Scenario using Dynamic Shape Coding EOS Retrieval of text information from natural scene images and video frames is a challenging task due to its inherent problems like complex character shapes, low resolution, background noise, etc. EOS Available OCR systems often fail to retrieve such information in scene/video frames. EOS Keyword spotting, an alternative way to retrieve information, performs efficient text searching in such scenarios. EOS However, current word spotting techniques in scene/video images are script-specific and they are mainly developed for Latin script. EOS This paper presents a novel word spotting framework using dynamic shape coding for text retrieval in natural scene image and video frames. EOS The framework is designed to search query keyword from multiple scripts with the help of on-the-fly script-wise keyword generation for the corresponding script. EOS We have used a two-stage word spotting approach using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect the translated keyword in a given text line by identifying the script of the line. EOS A novel unsupervised dynamic shape coding based scheme has been used to group similar shape characters to avoid confusion and to improve text alignment.	Next, the hypotheses locations are verified to improve retrieval performance.
doc	A role for recurrent processing in object completion: neurophysiological, psychophysical and computational"evidence EOS Recognition of objects from partial information presents a significant challenge for theories of vision because it requires spatial integration and extrapolation from prior knowledge. EOS We combined neurophysiological recordings in human cortex with psychophysical measurements and computational modeling to investigate the mechanisms involved in object completion. EOS We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1,699 electrodes in 18 epilepsy patients to measure the timing and selectivity of responses along human visual cortex to whole and partial objects. EOS Responses along the ventral visual stream remained selective despite showing only 9-25% of the object. EOS However, these visually selective signals emerged ~100 ms later for partial versus whole objects.	The processing delays were particularly pronounced in higher visual areas within the ventral stream, suggesting the involvement of additional recurrent processing.

doc	Study of the material of the ATLAS inner detector for Run 2 of the LHC EOS The ATLAS inner detector comprises three different sub-detectors: the pixel detector, the silicon strip tracker, and the transition-radiation drift-tube tracker. EOS The Insertable _EQN_ -Layer, a new innermost pixel layer, was installed during the shutdown period in 2014, together with modifications to the layout of the cables and support structures of the existing pixel detector. EOS The material in the inner detector is studied with several methods, using a low-luminosity _EQN_ TeV _EQN_ collision sample corresponding to around _EQN_ collected in 2015 with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.	In this paper, the material within the innermost barrel region is studied using reconstructed hadronic interaction and photon conversion vertices.
doc	Survey of Gravitationally-lensed Objects in HSC Imaging (SuGOHI). IV. Lensed quasar search in the HSC survey EOS Strong gravitationally lensed quasars provide powerful means to study galaxy evolution and cosmology. EOS We use Chitah to hunt for new lens systems in the Hyper Suprime _EQN_ Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) S16A. EOS We present 46 lens candidates, of which 3 are previously known. EOS Including 2 additional lenses found by YattaLens, we obtain X-shooter spectra of 6 promising candidates for lens confirmation and redshift measurements. EOS We report new spectroscopic redshift measurements for both the lens and source galaxies in 4 lens systems. EOS We apply the lens modeling software Glee to model our 6 X-shooter lenses uniformly. EOS Through our analysis of the HSC images, we find that HSCJ022622 _EQN_ 042522, HSCJ115252 _EQN_ 004733, and HSCJ141136 _EQN_ 010216 have point-like lensed images, and that the lens light distribution is well aligned with mass distribution within 6 deg.	Thanks to the X-shooter spectra, we estimate fluxes on the Baldwin- Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram, and find that HSCJ022622 _EQN_ 042522 has a probable quasar source, based on the upper limit of the Nii flux intensity.
doc	Terahertz Pulse Shaping Using Diffractive Legos EOS Recent advances in deep learning have been providing non-intuitive solutions to various inverse problems in optics. EOS At the intersection of machine learning and optics, diffractive networks merge wave-optics with deep learning to design task-specific elements to all-optically perform various tasks such as object classification and machine vision. EOS Here, we present a diffractive network, which is used to shape an arbitrary broadband pulse into a desired optical waveform, forming a compact pulse engineering system. EOS We experimentally demonstrate the synthesis of square pulses with different temporal-widths by manufacturing passive diffractive layers that collectively control both the spectral amplitude and the phase of an input terahertz pulse. EOS Our results constitute the first demonstration of direct pulse shaping in terahertz spectrum, where a complex-valued spectral modulation function directly acts on terahertz frequencies.	Furthermore, a Lego-like physical transfer learning approach is presented to illustrate pulse-width tunability by replacing part of an existing network with newly trained diffractive layers, demonstrating its modularity.
doc	Large Magnetoresistance in Co/Ni/Co Ferromagnetic Single Electron Transistors EOS We report on magnetotransport investigations of nano-scaled ferromagnetic Co/Ni/Co single electron transistors. EOS As a result of reduced size, the devices exhibit single electron transistor characteristics at 4.2K.	Magnetotransport measurements carried out at 1.8K reveal tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) traces with negative coercive fields, which we interpret in terms of a switching mechanism driven by the shape anisotropy of the central wire-like Ni island.
doc	Radon Features and Barcodes for Medical Image Retrieval via SVM EOS For more than two decades, research has been performed on content-based image retrieval (CBIR). EOS By combining Radon projections and the support vector machines (SVM), a content-based medical image retrieval method is presented in this work. EOS The proposed approach employs the normalized Radon projections with corresponding image category labels to build an SVM classifier, and the Radon barcode database which encodes every image in a binary format is also generated simultaneously to tag all images. EOS To retrieve similar images when a query image is given, Radon projections and the barcode of the query image are generated.	Subsequently, the k-nearest neighbor search method is applied to find the images with minimum Hamming distance of the Radon barcode within the same class predicted by the trained SVM classifier that uses Radon features.

doc	Introduction to Potential Theory via Applications EOS We introduce the basic concepts related to subharmonic functions and potentials, mainly for the case of the complex plane and prove the Riesz decomposition theorem. EOS Beyond the elementary facts of the theory we deviate slightly from the usual path of exposition and introduce further concepts alongside with applications. EOS We cover the Dirichlet problem in detail and illustrate the relations between potential theory and probability by considering harmonic measure and its relation to Brownian motion. EOS Furthermore Green's function is introduced and an application to growth of polynomials is given. EOS Equilibrium measures are motivated by their original development in physics and we end with a brief discussion of capacity and its relation to Hausdorff measure. EOS We hope that the reader, who is familiar with the main elements of real analysis, complex analysis, measure theory and some probability theory benefits from these notes. EOS No new results are presented but we hope that the style of presentation enables the reader to understand quickly the basic ideas of potential theory and how it can be used in different contexts. EOS The notes can also be used for a short course on potential theory.	Therefore the required prerequisites are described in the Appendix.
doc	The Dinegentropy of Diagnostic Tests EOS Diagnostic testing is germane to a variety of scenarios in medicine, pandemic tracking, threat detection, and signal processing. EOS This is an expository paper with some original results. EOS Here we first set up a mathematical architecture for diagnostics, and explore its probabilistic underpinnings. EOS Doing so enables us to develop new metrics for assessing the efficacy of different kinds of diagnostic tests, and for solving a long standing open problem in diagnostics, namely, comparing tests when their receiver operating characteristic curves cross. EOS The first is done by introducing the notion of what we call, a Gini Coefficient; EOS the second by invoking the information theoretic notion of dinegentropy. EOS Taken together, these may be seen a contribution to the state of the art of diagnostics.	The spirit of our work could also be relevant to the much discussed topic of batch testing, where each batch is defined by the partitioning strategy used to create it.
doc	Radical factorization in finitary ideal systems EOS In this paper we investigate the concept of radical factorization with respect to finitary ideal systems of cancellative monoids. EOS We present new characterizations for r-almost Dedekind r-SP-monoids and provide specific descriptions of t-almost Dedekind t-SP-monoids and w-SP-monoids. EOS We show that a monoid is a w-SP-monoid if and only if the radical of every nontrivial principal ideal is t-invertible.	We characterize when the monoid ring is a w-SP-domain and describe when the *-Nagata ring is an SP-domain for a star operation * of finite type.
doc	Variational structure of Luttinger-Ward formalism and bold diagrammatic expansion for Euclidean lattice field theory EOS The Luttinger-Ward functional was proposed more than five decades ago to provide a link between static and dynamic quantities in a quantum many-body system.	Despite its widespread usage, the derivation of the Luttinger-Ward functional remains valid only in the formal sense, and even the very existence of this functional has been challenged by recent numerical evidence.
doc	Using the Data Agreement Criterion to Rank Experts' Beliefs EOS Experts' beliefs embody a present state of knowledge. EOS It is desirable to take this knowledge into account when doing analyses or making decisions. EOS Yet ranking experts based on the merit of their beliefs is a difficult task. EOS In this paper we show how experts can be ranked based on their knowledge and their level of (un)certainty. EOS By letting experts specify their knowledge in the form of a probability distribution we can assess how accurately they can predict new data, and how appropriate their level of (un)certainty is. EOS The expert's specified probability distribution can be seen as a prior in a Bayesian statistical setting. EOS By extending an existing prior-data conflict measure to evaluate multiple priors, i.e.	experts' beliefs, we can compare experts with each other and the data to evaluate their appropriateness.

doc	Collisional and Thermal Emission Models of Debris Disks: Towards Planetesimal Population Properties EOS Debris disks around main-sequence stars are believed to derive from planetesimal populations that have accreted at early epochs and survived possible planet formation processes. EOS While debris disks must contain solids in a broad range of sizes - from big planetesimals down to tiny dust grains - debris disk observations are only sensitive to the dust end of the size distribution. EOS Collisional models of debris disks are needed to "climb up" the ladder of the collisional cascade, from dust towards parent bodies, representing the main mass reservoir of the disks.	We have used our collisional code to generate five disks around a sun-like star, assuming planetesimal belts at 3, 10, 30, 100, and 200 AU with 10 times the Edgeworth-Kuiper-belt mass density, and to evolve them for 10 Gyr.
doc	Wavelength Scaling and Square/Stripe and Grain Mobility Transitions in Vertically Oscillated Granular Layers EOS Laboratory experiments are conducted to examine granular wave patterns near onset as a function of the container oscillation frequency f and amplitude A, layer depth H, and grain diameter D. EOS The primary transition from a flat grain layer to standing waves occurs when the layer remains dilated after making contact with the container.	With a flat layer and increasing dimensionless peak container acceleration G = 4 pi^2 f^2 A/g (g is the acceleration due to gravity), the wave transition occurs for G=2.6, but with decreasing G the waves persist to G=2.2.
doc	Additive Deformations of Hopf Algebras EOS Additive deformations of bialgebras in the sense of Wirth are deformations of the multiplication map of the bialgebra fulfilling a compatibility condition with the coalgebra structure and a continuity condition. EOS Two problems concerning additive deformations are considered. EOS With a deformation theory a cohomology theory should be developed. EOS Here a variant of the Hochschild cohomology is used. EOS The main result in the first part of this paper is the characterization of the trivial deformations, i.e. EOS deformations generated by a coboundary.	When one starts with a Hopf algebra, one would expect the deformed multiplications to have some analogue to the antipode, which we call deformed antipodes.
doc	Parity patterns associated with lifts of Hecke groups EOS Let _EQN_ be an odd prime, _EQN_ a positive integer, and let _EQN_ be the group generated by two elements _EQN_ and _EQN_ subject to the relations _EQN_ and _EQN_ ; EOS that is, _EQN_ is the free product of two cyclic groups of orders _EQN_ respectively _EQN_, amalgamated along their subgroups of order _EQN_. EOS Our main result determines the parity behaviour of the generalized subgroup numbers of _EQN_ which were defined in [T. EOS W. EOS M\"uller, Adv. EOS in Math. EOS 153 (2000), 118-154], and which count all the homomorphisms of index _EQN_ subgroups of _EQN_ into a given finite group _EQN_, in the case when _EQN_. EOS This computation depends upon the solution of three counting problems in the Hecke group _EQN_: (i) determination of the parity of the subgroup numbers of _EQN_ ; EOS (ii) determination of the parity of the number of index _EQN_ subgroups of _EQN_ which are isomorphic to a free product of copies of _EQN_ and of _EQN_ ; EOS (iii) determination of the parity of the number of index _EQN_ subgroups in _EQN_ which are isomorphic to a free product of copies of _EQN_.

doc	PIERNIK mhd code - a multi-fluid, non-ideal extension of the relaxing-TVD scheme (IV) EOS We present a new multi-fluid, grid MHD code PIERNIK, which is based on the Relaxing TVD scheme (Jin & Xin, 1995). EOS The original scheme (see Trac & Pen (2003) and Pen et al (2003)) has been extended by an addition of dynamically independent, but interacting fluids: dust and a diffusive cosmic ray gas, described within the fluid approximation, with an option to add other fluids in an easy way.	The code has been equipped with shearing-box boundary conditions, and a selfgravity module, Ohmic resistivity module, as well as other facilities which are useful in astrophysical fluid-dynamical simulations.
doc	Calibrating the binary black hole population in nuclear star clusters through tidal disruption events EOS As the sensitivity of gravitational wave (GW) instruments improves and new networks start operating, hundreds of merging stellar-mass black holes (SBHs) and intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are expected to be observed in the next few years. EOS The origin and distribution of SBH and IMBH binaries in various dynamical environments is a fundamental scientific question in GW astronomy. EOS In this paper we discuss the electromagnetic window provided by tidal disruption events (TDEs) of stars, into the assembly and merger of binary SBHs and IMBHs in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). EOS We discuss how the host NSC mass and density and the slope of the black-hole mass function set the orbital properties and the masses of the binaries that undergo a TDE. EOS For typical NSC properties, we predict a merger rate of _EQN_ -- _EQN_ per galaxy. EOS The lightcurve of TDEs in NSCs could be interrupted and modulated by the companion black hole on the orbital period of the binary. EOS The ejected mass associated with TDEs can produce optical transients of luminosity _EQN_ -- _EQN_ erg s _EQN_ over timescales of days to months.	These should be readily detectable by optical transient surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility and LSST.
doc	Two-meson cloud contribution to the baryon antidecuplet self-energy EOS We study the self-energy of the SU(3) antidecuplet coming from two-meson virtual clouds.

doc	Dissipative Phase Fluctuations In A Superconductor In Proximity To An Electron Gas EOS We study a two-dimensional superconductor in close proximity to a two-dimensional metallic sheet. EOS The electrons in the superconducting sheet are coupled to those in the metallic sheet by the Coulomb interaction only. EOS We obtain an effective phase-only action for the superconductor by integrating out all the electronic degrees of freedom in the problem. EOS The Coulomb drag of the normal electrons in the metallic sheet is found to make the spectrum of phase-fluctuations in the superconductor, dissipative at long wavelengths.	The dissipative co-efficient _EQN_ is shown to be simply related to the normal state conductivities of the superconducting layer (_EQN_)and the metallic sheet (_EQN_) by the relation _EQN_.
doc	Green's Relations in Finite Transformation Semigroups EOS We consider the complexity of Green's relations when the semigroup is given by transformations on a finite set. EOS Green's relations can be defined by reachability in the (right/left/two-sided) Cayley graph. EOS The equivalence classes then correspond to the strongly connected components. EOS It is not difficult to show that, in the worst case, the number of equivalence classes is in the same order of magnitude as the number of elements. EOS Another important parameter is the maximal length of a chain of components. EOS Our main contribution is an exponential lower bound for this parameter. EOS There is a simple construction for an arbitrary set of generators. EOS However, the proof for constant alphabet is rather involved.	Our results also apply to automata and their syntactic semigroups.
doc	J/\Psi \to \phi \pi \pi (K \bar K) decays, chiral dynamcis and OZI violation EOS We have studied the invariant mass distributions of the \pi\pi and K \bar K systems for invariant masses up to 1.2 GeV from the J/\Psi \to \phi \pi\pi(K\bar K) decays. EOS The approach exploits the connection between these processes and the \pi\pi and K\bar K strange and non-strange scalar form factors by considering the \phi meson as a spectator. EOS The calculated scalar form factors are then matched with the ones from next-to-leading order chiral perturbation theory, including the calculation of the the K\bar K scalar form factors. EOS Final state interactions in the J/\Psi \to \phi \pi\pi (K\bar K) processes are taken into account as rescattering effects in the system of the two pseudoscalar mesons.	A very good agreement with the experimental data from DM2 and MARK-III is achieved.
doc	Investigations on Increased Data rate Differential Space-Time Block Codes for Single Carrier Wireless Systems EOS In this thesis, we study differential modulation schemes which do not need channel knowledge at the transmitter nor at the receiver. EOS First, we consider single-antenna systems and investigate the use of Differential Amplitude Phase Shift Keying (DAPSK) modulation.	We study the use of Multiple-Symbol Differential Detection (MSDD) to bridge the performance gap between coherent and non-coherent systems and remove the error floor associated with fast-fading channels.
doc	Conformal Mapping, Power Corrections, and the QCD Bound State Spectrum EOS We analyze the heavy quark bound state spectrum using an order-dependent conformal mapping to re-sum the perturbative expansion for current correlators. EOS The procedure consists of two main steps. EOS Firstly, the Borel plane structure of the truncated perturbative expression is modified to ensure consistency with the operator product expansion. EOS This is analogous to a resummation of infrared renormalon chains. EOS Secondly, this perturbative expansion is conformally mapped to a new series with improved convergence properties. EOS This approach may be shown to induce power corrections consistent with existing condensates, and the resulting expansion may be ordered in powers of an infrared-analytic effective coupling. EOS The technique is then applied to _EQN_ and _EQN_ sum rules without any explicit introduction of vacuum condensate parameters.	Ground state masses for the vector, axial--vector, and _EQN_ channels are well reproduced, while results for the scalar--pseudoscalar mass splitting are less impressive.

EOS Spitzer images in the IR at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0um, and 24um and GALEX images at 1500\AA and 2300\AA allow us to resolve the galaxy on scales between 240-600pc. EOS We supplement these with archival data in the B, J, H, and K bands.	We use the 8um, 24um and FUV (1500\AA) emission to study the star formation rate (SFR).

doc	New Experiments to Measure the Muon Anomalous Gyromagnetic Moment EOS The magnetic moment is a fundamental property of particles. EOS The measurement of these magnetic moments and the comparison with the values predicted by the standard model of particle physics is a way to test our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of our world. EOS In some cases, such as for the electron, this comparison has resulted in confirmation of the standard model with incredible precision. EOS In contrast, the magnetic moment of the muon has shown a long-standing disagreement in the measured and the predicted value. EOS There is currently a tantalizing three-standard-deviation difference between the current best measurement (with a precision of 0.54 ppm) and the state-of-the-art standard model prediction. EOS This represents one of the very few experimental hints for physics beyond the standard model. EOS There are currently two major experimental efforts underway to improve the precision of the muon magnetic moment measurement. EOS The first is an evolution of the E-821 experiment, originally located at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States. EOS This is experiment, E-989, is located at Fermilab and will measure the spin precession rate of positive muons in a 14-m diameter storage ring using decay positrons. EOS The goal of the experiment is to reduce the current experimental uncertainty by a factor of three. EOS The experiment is currently being constructed and aims to start taking data in 2017. EOS An alternative, and very complementary, experiment is being planned at J-PARC in Japan.	This experiment, E-34, will utilize low energy, ultra-cold muons in a much smaller storage ring.
doc	Twisted Gravitational Waves EOS In general relativity (GR), linearized gravitational waves propagating in empty Minkowski spacetime along a fixed spatial direction have the property that the wave front is the Euclidean plane.

These have parallel rays and uniform wave fronts.
doc	Mixed topology ring states for Hall effect and orbital magnetism in skyrmions of Weyl semimetals EOS Skyrmion lattices as a novel type of chiral spin states are attracting increasing attention, owing to their peculiar properties stemming from real-space topological properties. EOS At the same time, the properties of magnetic Weyl semimetals with complex _EQN_ -space topology are moving into the focus of research in spintronics. EOS We consider the Hall transport properties and orbital magnetism of skyrmion lattices imprinted in topological semimetals, by employing a minimal model of a 2D mixed Weyl semimetal which, as a function of the magnetization direction, exhibits two Chern insulator phases separated by a Weyl state for an an in-plane magnetization direction.	We find that while the orbital magnetization is topologically robust and Hall transport properties are very sensitive to the details of the spin distribution in accordance to the behavior expected from the recently discovered chiral Hall effect, their behavior in the region of the Chern insulator gap is largely determined by the properties of the so-called mixed topology ring states, emerging in domain walls that separate the skyrmion core from the ferromagnetic background.

EOS The result can be described as generalized hypergeometric functions of triple variables.	Based on the triple hypergeometric functions, we also establish the systems of homogeneous linear partial differential equations(PDEs) satisfied by the mentioned scalar integral.
doc	Multifractal analysis of the metal-insulator transition in the 3D Anderson model II: Symmetry relation under ensemble averaging EOS We study the multifractal analysis (MFA) of electronic wavefunctions at the localisation-delocalisation transition in the 3D Anderson model for very large system sizes up to _EQN_. EOS The singularity spectrum _EQN_ is numerically obtained using the \textsl ensemble average of the scaling law for the generalized inverse participation ratios _EQN_, employing box-size and system-size scaling. EOS The validity of a recently reported symmetry law [Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS 97, 046803 (2006)] for the multifractal spectrum is carefully analysed at the metal-insulator transition (MIT). EOS The results are compared to those obtained using different approaches, in particular the typical average of the scaling law.	System-size scaling with ensemble average appears as the most adequate method to carry out the numerical MFA.

doc	High-temperature superconductivity from fine-tuning of Fermi-surface singularities in iron oxypnictides EOS In the family of the iron-based superconductors, the _EQN_ FeAsO-type compounds (with _EQN_ being a rare-earth metal) exhibit the highest bulk superconducting transition temperatures (_EQN_) up to _EQN_ and thus hold the key to the elusive pairing mechanism. EOS Recently, it has been demonstrated that the intrinsic electronic structure of SmFe _EQN_ Co _EQN_ AsO (_EQN_) is highly nontrivial and consists of multiple band-edge singularities in close proximity to the Fermi level.	However, it remains unclear whether these singularities are generic to the _EQN_ FeAsO-type materials and if so, whether their exact topology is responsible for the aforementioned record _EQN_.
doc	Real-time Image-based 6-DOF Localization in Large-Scale Environments EOS We present a real-time approach for image-based localization within large scenes that have been reconstructed offline using structure from motion (Sfm). EOS From monocular video, our method continuously computes a precise 6-DOF camera pose, by efficiently tracking natural features and matching them to 3D points in the Sfm point cloud. EOS Our main contribution lies in efficiently interleaving a fast keypoint tracker that uses inexpensive binary feature descriptors with a new approach for direct 2D-to-3D matching. EOS The 2D-to-3D matching avoids the need for online extraction of scale-invariant features. EOS Instead, offline we construct an indexed database containing multiple DAISY descriptors per 3D point extracted at multiple scales. EOS The key to the efficiency of our method lies in invoking DAISY descriptor extraction and matching sparingly during localization, and in distributing this computation over a window of successive frames. EOS This enables the algorithm to run in real-time, without fluctuations in the latency over long durations. EOS We evaluate the method in large indoor and outdoor scenes.	Our algorithm runs at over 30 Hz on a laptop and at 12 Hz on a low-power, mobile computer suitable for onboard computation on a quadrotor micro aerial vehicle.
doc	The 80 Ms follow-up of the X-ray afterglow of GRB 130427A challenges the standard forward shock model EOS GRB 130427A was the brightest gamma-ray burst detected in the last 30 years. EOS With an equivalent isotropic energy output of _EQN_ erg and redshift _EQN_, it uniquely combined very high energetics with a relative proximity to Earth. EOS As a consequence, its X-ray afterglow has been detected by sensitive X-ray observatories such as XMM-Newton and Chandra for a record-breaking baseline longer than 80 million seconds. EOS We present the X-ray light-curve of this event over such an interval. EOS The light-curve shows a simple power-law decay with a slope _EQN_ over more than three decades in time (47 ks - 83 Ms). EOS We discuss the consequences of this result for a few models proposed so far to interpret GRB 130427A, and more in general the significance of this outcome in the context of the standard forward shock model.	We find that this model has difficulty in explaining our data, in both cases of constant density and stellar wind circumburst media, and requires far-fetched values for the physical parameters involved.
doc	Coxeter-Catalan combinatorics and Temperley-Lieb algebras EOS We introduce bijections between generalized type _EQN_ noncrossing partitions (that is, associated to arbitrary standard Coxeter elements) and fully commutative elements of the same type. EOS The latter index the diagram basis of the classical Temperley-Lieb algebra, while for each choice of standard Coxeter element the corresponding noncrossing partitions also index a basis, given by the images in the Temperley-Lieb algebra of the simple elements of the dual Garside structure (associated to this choice of standard Coxeter element) of the Artin braid group on _EQN_ strands.	We then show that our bijections come from triangular base changes between the diagram basis and the various bases indexed by noncrossing partitions, by explicitly describing the orders giving triangularity.
doc	CP Violating Baryon Oscillations EOS We enumerate the conditions necessary for _EQN_ violation to be manifest in _EQN_ - _EQN_ oscillations, and build a simple model that can give rise to such effects.	We discuss a possible connection between neutron oscillations and dark matter, provided the mass of the latter lies between _EQN_ and _EQN_.

doc	Self diffusion and binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusion in simple fluids with the Green-Kubo method EOS Self diffusion coefficients and binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients were determined by equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with the Green-Kubo method. EOS The study covers five pure fluids: neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and methane and three binary mixtures: argon+krypton, argon+xenon, and krypton+xenon.	The fluids are modeled by spherical Lennard-Jones air-potentials, with parameters which were determined solely on the basis of vapor-liquid equilibria data.
doc	A number conserving theory for topologically protected degeneracy in one-dimensional fermions EOS Semiconducting nanowires in proximity to superconductors are among promising candidates to search for Majorana fermions and topologically protected degeneracies which may ultimately be used as building blocks for topological quantum computers. EOS The prediction of neutral Majorana fermions in the proximity-induced superconducting systems ignores number-conservation and thus leaves open the conceptual question of how a topological degeneracy that is robust to all local perturbations arises in a number-conserving system. EOS In this work, we study how local attractive interactions generate a topological ground-state near-degeneracy in a quasi one-dimensional superfluid using bosonization of the fermions. EOS The local attractive interactions opens a topological quasiparticle gap in the odd channel wires (with more than one channel) with end Majorana modes associated with a topological near-degeneracy.	We explicitly study the robustness of the topological degeneracy to local perturbations and find that such local perturbations result in quantum phase slips which split of the topological degeneracy by an amount that does not decrease exponentially with the length of the wire, but still decreases rapidly if the number of channels is large.
doc	Exhaustive families of representations of _EQN_ -algebras associated to _EQN_ -body Hamiltonians with asymptotically homogeneous interactions EOS We continue the analysis of algebras introduced by Georgescu, Nistor and their coauthors, in order to study _EQN_ -body type Hamiltonians with interactions. EOS More precisely, let _EQN_ be a linear subspace of a finite dimensional Euclidean space _EQN_, and _EQN_ be a continuous function on _EQN_ that has uniform homogeneous radial limits at infinity. EOS We consider, in this paper, Hamiltonians of the form _EQN_, where the subspaces _EQN_ belong to some given family S of subspaces. EOS We prove results on the spectral theory of the Hamiltonian when _EQN_ is any family of subspaces and extend those results to other operators affiliated to a larger algebra of pseudo-differential operators associated to the action of _EQN_ introduced by Connes. EOS In addition, we exhibit Fredholm conditions for such elliptic operators.	We also note that the algebras we consider answer a question of Melrose and Singer.

doc	A Bayesian Interval Dose-Finding Design Addressing Ockham's Razor: mTPI-2 EOS There has been an increasing interest in using interval-based Bayesian designs for dose finding, one of which is the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method. EOS We show that the decision rules in mTPI correspond to an optimal rule under a formal Bayesian decision theoretic framework. EOS However, the probability models in mTPI are overly sharpened by the Ockham's razor, which, while in general helps with parsimonious statistical inference, leads to suboptimal decisions in small-sample inference such as dose finding.	We propose a new framework that blunts the Ockham's razor, and demonstrate the superior performance of the new method, called mTPI-2.
doc	Structural versus dynamical origins of mean-field behavior in a self-organized critical model of neuronal avalanches EOS Critical dynamics of cortical neurons have been intensively studied over the past decade. EOS Neuronal avalanches provide the main experimental as well as theoretical tools to consider criticality in such systems. EOS Experimental studies show that critical neuronal avalanches show mean-field behavior. EOS There are structural as well as recently proposed [Phys. EOS Rev.	E 89, 052139 (2014)] dynamical mechanisms which can lead to mean-field behavior.

doc	Distant foreground and the Planck-derived Hubble constant EOS It is possible to reduce the discrepancy between the local measurement of the cosmological parameter _EQN_ and the value derived from the _EQN_ measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by considering contamination of the CMB by emission from some medium around distant extragalactic sources, such as extremely cold coarse-grain dust.	Though being distant, such a medium would still be in the foreground with respect to the CMB, and, as any other foreground, it would alter the CMB power spectrum.
doc	The Theory of Steady State Super-Eddington Winds and its Application to Novae EOS We present a model for steady state winds of systems with super-Eddington luminosities.

doc	Accelerating Deep Reinforcement Learning strategies of Flow Control through a multi-environment approach EOS Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently been proposed as a methodology to discover complex Active Flow Control (AFC) strategies [Rabault, J., Kuchta, M., Jensen, A., Reglade, U., & Cerardi, N. EOS (2019): "Artificial neural networks trained through deep reinforcement learning discover control strategies for active flow control", Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 865, 281-302]. EOS However, while promising results were obtained on a simple 2D benchmark flow at a moderate Reynolds number, considerable speedups will be required to investigate more challenging flow configurations. EOS In the case of DRL trained with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, it was found that the CFD part, rather than training the Artificial Neural Network, was the limiting factor for speed of execution. EOS Therefore, speedups should be obtained through a combination of two approaches.	The first one, which is well documented in the literature, is to parallelize the numerical simulation itself.
doc	Persistence of a Non-Equilibrium State: Observation of a Boltzmannian Special Case EOS Well before the atomistic nature of matter was experimentally established, Ludwig Boltzmann's audacious effort to explain the macroscopic world of human experience in terms of the workings of an unseen microscopic world met with vigorous opposition. EOS A contentious point was the problem of irreversibility: the microscopic equations of motion are reversible, yet friction and viscosity cause things always to slow down and warm up, never to speed up and cool down. EOS What was worse, Boltzmann himself discovered that his transport equation predicts special cases in which gases never come to thermal equilibrium, a particular example being that the monopole "breathe" mode of gas will never damp if it is confined in 3D to a perfectly isotropic harmonic potential. EOS Such absences of damping were not observed in nature. EOS Nondamping of a monopole mode in lower dimensional systems has only very recently been observed, using cold atoms. EOS Kinoshita et al and Chevy et al have experimentally observed suppressed relaxation in highly elongated geometries. EOS The difficulty in generating sufficiently spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms, however, has meant that Boltzmann's fully 3D, isotropic case has never been observed. EOS With the development of a new magnetic trap capable of producing near-spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms, we have been able to make the first observation of this historically significant oddity.	We observe a monopole mode for which the collisional contribution to damping vanishes, a long-delayed vindication for Boltzmann's microscopic theory.
doc	Polyhedral billiards, eigenfunction concentration and almost periodic control EOS We study dynamical properties of the billiard flow on convex polyhedra away from a neighbourhood of the non-smooth part of the boundary, called ``pockets''. EOS We prove there are only finitely many immersed periodic tubes missing the pockets and moreover establish a new quantitative estimate for the lengths of such tubes.	This extends well-known results in dimension _EQN_.
doc	Predictable Feature Analysis EOS Every organism in an environment, whether biological, robotic or virtual, must be able to predict certain aspects of its environment in order to survive or perform whatever task is intended. EOS It needs a model that is capable of estimating the consequences of possible actions, so that planning, control, and decision-making become feasible. EOS For scientific purposes, such models are usually created in a problem specific manner using differential equations and other techniques from control- and system-theory. EOS In contrast to that, we aim for an unsupervised approach that builds up the desired model in a self-organized fashion. EOS Inspired by Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), our approach is to extract sub-signals from the input, that behave as predictable as possible. EOS These "predictable features" are highly relevant for modeling, because predictability is a desired property of the needed consequence-estimating model by definition.	In our approach, we measure predictability with respect to a certain prediction model.

doc	Asymmetric Illumination of a Circumbinary Disk in the Presence of a Low-Mass Companion EOS The model of an young star with a protoplanetary disk and a low-mass companion, which is moving on a circular orbit, inclined to the disk plane, is considered. EOS The hydrodynamic models of such a system were calculated by SPH method. EOS It was shown the distortions in the disk, caused by the orbital motion of the companion, lead to the strong dependence of illumination conditions of the disk on the azimuth (because of extinction between the star and the disk surface) and, therefore, it leads to the appearance of large-scale asymmetry in images of disks. EOS The calculations showed the dependence of the illumination on the azimuth was stronger in the central part of the disk than on the periphery. EOS Bright and dark domains are located not symmetry with respect to the line of nodes. EOS The sizes and locations of the domains are depended on the model parameters as well as on the phase of the orbital period. EOS The bright and dark domains do not follow the companion, but they make small amplitude oscillations with respect to some direction.	The properties of the model, which were written above, open new opportunities of searching low-mass companions in the vicinity of young stars.
doc	Detecting Oceans on Extrasolar Planets Using the Glint Effect EOS Glint, the specular reflection of sunlight off Earth's oceans, may reveal the presence of oceans on an extrasolar planet. EOS As an Earth-like planet nears crescent phases, the size of the ocean glint spot increases relative to the fraction of illuminated disk, while the reflectivity of this spot increases. EOS Both effects change the planet's visible reflectivity as a function of phase. EOS However, strong forward scattering of radiation by clouds can also produce increases in a planet's reflectivity as it approaches crescent phases, and surface glint can be obscured by Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric absorption.	Here we explore the detectability of glint in the presence of an atmosphere and realistic phase-dependent scattering from oceans and clouds.
doc	Counter-rotating spiral order in three dimensional iridates: signature of hidden symmetry in Kitaev- _EQN_ model EOS The unconventional magnetic orderings found in Kitaev spin liquid candidates suggest frustration of spin interactions, and raise a possibility of nearby spin liquid phases. EOS In particular, counter-rotating spiral ordering in three-dimensional (3D) iridates is striking, and understanding the microscopic mechanism of such ordering may provide routes to 3D Kitaev spin liquids.	We study a minimal 3D model including Kitaev _EQN_ and a symmetric off-diagonal bond-dependent _EQN_ interaction on the hyperhoneycomb lattice using exact diagonalization.
doc	On the enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate in the diffuse cloud towards Zeta Persei EOS The spatial distribution of the cosmic-ray flux is important in understanding the Interstellar Medium (ISM) of the Galaxy. EOS This distribution can be analyzed by studying different molecular species along different sight lines whose abundances are sensitive to the cosmic-ray ionization rate.	Recently several groups have reported an enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate in diffuse clouds compared to the standard value, zeta(average)=2.5e-17 s^-1, measured toward dense molecular clouds.
doc	Helicity decoupling in the massless limit of massive tensor fields EOS Massive and massless potentials play an essential role in the perturbative formulation of particle interactions. EOS Many difficulties arise due to the indefinite metric in gauge theoretic approaches, or the increase with the spin of the UV dimension of massive potentials. EOS All these problems can be evaded in one stroke: modify the potentials by suitable terms that leave unchanged the field strengths, but are not polynomial in the momenta. EOS This feature implies a weaker localization property: the potentials are "string-localized". EOS In this setting, several old issues can be solved directly in the physical Hilbert space of the respective particles: We can control the separation of helicities in the massless limit of higher spin fields and conversely we recover massive potentials with 2s+1 degrees of freedom by a smooth deformation of the massless potentials ("fattening").	We construct stress-energy tensors for massless fields of any helicity (thus evading the Weinberg-Witten theorem).
doc	From noncommutative space-time to quantum relativistic symmetries with fundamental mass parameter EOS We consider the simplest class of Lie-algebraic deformations of space-time algebra, with the selection of _EQN_ -deformations as providing quantum deformation of relativistic framework.

doc	Generation of concurrence between two qubits locally coupled to a one dimensional spin chain EOS We consider a generalized central spin model, consisting of two central qubits and an environmental spin chain (with periodic boundary condition) to which these central qubits are locally and weakly connected either at the same site or at two different sites separated by a distance _EQN_. EOS Our purpose is to study the subsequent temporal generation of entanglement, quantified by concurrence, when initially the qubits are in an unentangled state. EOS In the equilibrium situation, we show that the concurrence survives for a larger value of _EQN_ when the environmental spin chain is critical.	Importantly, a common feature observed both in the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium situations while the latter is created by a sudden but global change of the environmental transverse field, is that the two qubits become maximally entangled for the critical quenching.
doc	A Necessary Trade-off for Semiclassical Electrodynamics: Accurate Short-Range Coulomb Interactions versus the Enforcement of Causality? EOS We investigate two key representative semiclassical approaches for propagating resonant energy transfer between a pair of electronic two-level systems (donor and acceptor) with coupled Maxwell-Liouville equations. EOS On the one hand, when the electromagnetic (EM) field is treated classically and Coulomb interactions are treated quantum-mechanically, we find that a quantum-classical mismatch leads to a violation of causality, i.e., the acceptor can be excited before the retarded EM field arrives. EOS On the other hand, if we invoke a classical intermolecular Coulomb operator, we find that the energy transfer in the near field loses quantitative accuracy compared with F\"orster theory, even though causality is strictly obeyed. EOS Thus, our work raises a fundamental paradox when choosing a semiclassical electrodynamics algorithm.	Namely, which is more important: Accurate short range interactions or long range causality?

doc	DAG-width is PSPACE-complete EOS Berwanger et al show that for every graph _EQN_ of size _EQN_ and DAG-width _EQN_ there is a DAG decomposition of width _EQN_ and size _EQN_. EOS This gives a polynomial time algorithm for determining the DAG-width of a graph for any fixed _EQN_. EOS However, if the DAG-width of the graphs from a class is not bounded, such algorithms become exponential. EOS This raises the question whether we can always find a DAG decomposition of size polynomial in _EQN_ as it is the case for tree width and all generalisations of tree width similar to DAG-width. EOS We show that there is an infinite class of graphs such that every DAG decomposition of optimal width has size super-polynomial in _EQN_ and, moreover, there is no polynomial size DAG decomposition which would approximate an optimal decomposition up to an additive constant.	In the second part we use our construction to prove that deciding whether the DAG-width of a given graph is at most a given constant is PSPACE-complete.
doc	K-resolver: Towards Decentralizing Encrypted DNS Resolution EOS Centralized DNS over HTTPS/TLS (DoH/DoT) resolution, which has started being deployed by major hosting providers and web browsers, has sparked controversy among Internet activists and privacy advocates due to several privacy concerns. EOS This design decision causes the trace of all DNS resolutions to be exposed to a third-party resolver, different than the one specified by the user's access network. EOS In this work we propose K-resolver, a DNS resolution mechanism that disperses DNS queries across multiple DoH resolvers, reducing the amount of information about a user's browsing activity exposed to each individual resolver. EOS As a result, none of the resolvers can learn a user's entire web browsing history.	We have implemented a prototype of our approach for Mozilla Firefox, and used it to evaluate the performance of web page load time compared to the default centralized DoH approach.

doc	Deeply Embedded Protostellar Population in the Central Molecular Zone Suggested by H _EQN_ O Masers and Dense Cores EOS The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), usually referring to the inner 500 pc of the Galaxy, contains a dozen of massive (_EQN_ _EQN_) molecular clouds. EOS Are these clouds going to actively form stars like Sgr B2? EOS How are they affected by the extreme physical conditions in the CMZ, such as strong turbulence? EOS Here we present a first step towards answering these questions. EOS Using high-sensitivity, high angular resolution radio and (sub)millimeter observations, we studied deeply embedded star formation in six massive clouds in the CMZ, including the 20 and 50 km s _EQN_ clouds, Sgr B1 off (as known as dust ridge clouds e/f), Sgr C, Sgr D, and G0.253-0.016. EOS The VLA water maser observations suggest a population of deeply embedded protostellar candidates, many of which are new detections. EOS The SMA 1.3 mm continuum observations reveal peaks in dust emission associated with the masers, suggesting the existence of dense cores. EOS While our findings confirm that clouds such as G0.253-0.016 lack internal compact substructures and are quiescent in terms of star formation, two clouds (the 20 km s _EQN_ cloud and Sgr C) stand out with clusters of water masers with associated dense cores which may suggest a population of deeply embedded protostars at early evolutionary phases.	Follow-up observations with VLA and ALMA are necessary to confirm their protostellar nature.

EOS We have used Nf = 2 dynamical quark gauge configurations at four values of the lattice spacing generated by ETMC.	Extrapolation in the heavy quark mass from the charm to the bottom quark region has been carried out using ratios of physical quantities computed at nearby quark masses, having an exactly known infinite mass limit.
doc	Static correlated functionals for reduced density matrix functional theory EOS Based on recent progress on fermionic exchange symmetry we propose a way to develop new functionals for reduced density matrix functional theory.

doc	An adaptively weighted statistic for detecting differential gene expression when combining multiple transcriptomic studies EOS Global expression analyses using microarray technologies are becoming more common in genomic research, therefore, new statistical challenges associated with combining information from multiple studies must be addressed. EOS In this paper we will describe our proposal for an adaptively weighted (AW) statistic to combine multiple genomic studies for detecting differentially expressed genes. EOS We will also present our results from comparisons of our proposed AW statistic to Fisher's equally weighted (EW), Tippett's minimum p-value (minP) and Pearson's (PR) statistics.	Due to the absence of a uniformly powerful test, we used a simplified Gaussian scenario to compare the four methods.
doc	Constraints on Photometric Calibration from Observations of High-Redshift Type Ia Supernovae EOS The good match of the type Ia supernova (SNIa) Hubble Diagram to the prediction of a not-unreasonable cosmological world model shows that measurements of standard stars and their comparison with point sources down to m=25 mag is good to better than +/-0.5 mag over an 11 mag range. EOS It also shows that the true spectral energy distribution (SED) shapes of standard stars are known to better than +/-0.5 mag over an octave in wavelength. EOS On the other hand, the SNIa argument for an accelerating Universe assumes that the magnitude system is good to much better than ~0.1 mag over the 11 mag range, and that SED shapes are known to much better than ~10 percent over an octave in wavelength.	There is no independent empirical evidence for these plausible assumptions.
doc	Lateral width of shower image in the Auger fluorescence detector EOS The impact of the lateral distribution of light in extensive air showers on the detection and reconstruction of shower profiles is investigated for the Auger fluorescence telescopes. EOS Based on three-dimensional simulations, the capability of the Auger telescopes to measure the lateral distribution of light is evaluated. EOS The ability to infer the actual lateral distribution is confirmed by the comparison of detailed simulations with real data. EOS The contribution of pixels located far from the axis of the shower image is calculated and the accepted signal is rescaled in order to reconstruct a correct shower profile.	The analysis presented here shows that: (a) the Auger telescopes are able to observe the lateral distribution of showers and (b) the energy corrections to account for the signal in outlying pixels can exceed 10%, depending on shower geometry.
doc	Self-adjoint symmetry operators connected with the magnetic Heisenberg ring EOS We consider symmetry operators a from the group ring C[S_N] which act on the Hilbert space H of the 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg magnetic ring with N sites. EOS We investigate such symmetry operators a which are self-adjoint (in a sence defined in the paper) and which yield consequently observables of the Heisenberg model. EOS We prove the following results: (i) One can construct a self-adjoint idempotent symmetry operator from every irreducible character of every subgroup of S_N. EOS This leads to a big manifold of observables.	In particular every commutation symmetry yields such an idempotent.
doc	The effect of macromodel uncertainties on microlensing modelling of lensed quasars EOS Cosmological gravitational microlensing has been proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the structure of multiply imaged quasars, especially the accretion disc and central supermassive black-hole system. EOS However, the derived constraints on models may be affected by large systematic errors introduced in the various stages of modelling, namely, the macromodels, the microlensing magnification maps, and the convolution with realistic disc profiles. EOS In particular, it has been known that different macromodels of the galaxy lens that fit the observations equally well, can lead to different values of convergence, _EQN_, and shear, _EQN_, required to generate magnification maps.	So far, 25 microlensed quasars have been studied using microlensing techniques, where each system has been modelled and analyzed individually, or in small samples.

doc	Stability of Universal Equivalence of Groups under Free Constructions EOS In 1971 J. EOS Stallings introduced a generalisation of amalgamated products of groups -- called a pregroup, which is a particular kind of a partial group. EOS He defined the universal group U(P) of a pregroup P to be a universal object (in the sense of category theory) extending the partial operations on P to group operations on U(P). EOS This turns out to be a versatile and convenient generalisation of classical group constructions: HNN-extensions and amalgamated products. EOS In this respect the following general question arises. EOS Which properties of pregroups, or relations between pregroups, carry over to the respective universal groups? EOS In this paper it is proved that universal equivalence of pregroups extends to universal equivalence of universal groups.	Applications to free products with amalgamation and HNN-extensions are then described.
doc	An unified theory of quantised electrons, phonons and photons out-of-equilibrium: a simplified ab-initio approach based on the Generalised Baym-Kadanoff ansatz EOS We present a full ab-inito description of the coupled out-of-equilibrium dynamics of photons, phonons, and electrons. EOS In the present approach the quantised nature of the electromagnetic field as well as of the nuclear oscillations is fully taken into account. EOS The result is a set of integro-differential equations, written on the Keldysh contour, for the Green's functions of electrons, phonons, and photons where the different kind of interactions are merged together. EOS We then concentrate on the electronic dynamics in order to reduce the problem to a computationally feasible approach. EOS By using the Generalised Baym-Kadanoff ansatz and the Completed Collision approximation we introduce a series of efficient but controllable approximations. EOS In this way we reduce all equations to a set of decoupled equations for the density matrix that describe all kind of static and dynamical correlations.	The final result is a coherent, general, and inclusive scheme to calculate several physical quantities: carrier dynamics, transient photo-absorption and light-emission.
doc	Modelling dynamic route choice of pedestrians to assess the criticality of building evacuation EOS This paper presents an event-driven way finding algorithm for pedestrians in an evacuation scenario, which operates on a graph-based structure. EOS The motivation of each pedestrian is to leave the facility. EOS The events used to redirect pedestrians include the identification of a jam situation and/or identification of a better route than the current. EOS This study considers two types of pedestrians: familiar and unfamiliar with the facility. EOS Four strategies are modelled to cover those groups. EOS The modelled strategies are the shortest path (local and global); EOS They are combined with a quickest path approach, which is based on an observation principle. EOS In the quickest path approach, pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment and are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit analysis function. EOS The dynamic modelling of route choice with different strategies and types of pedestrians considers the manifold of in uences which appears in the real system and raises questions about the criticality of an evacuation process. EOS To address this question criteria are elaborated. EOS The criteria we focus on in this contribution are the evacuation time, the individual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution and the overall jam size itself. EOS The in uences of the different strategies on those evaluation criteria are investigated. EOS The sensibility of the system to disturbances (e.g.	broken escape route) is also analysed.
doc	Thom-Sebastiani & Duality for Matrix Factorizations EOS The derived category of a hypersurface has an action by "cohomology operations" k[t], deg t=-2, underlying the 2-periodic structure on its category of singularities (as matrix factorizations). EOS We prove a Thom-Sebastiani type Theorem, identifying the k[t]-linear tensor products of these dg categories with coherent complexes on the zero locus of the sum potential on the product (with a support condition), and identify the dg category of colimit-preserving k[t]-linear functors between Ind-completions with Ind-coherent complexes on the zero locus of the difference potential (with a support condition). EOS These results imply the analogous statements for the 2-periodic dg categories of matrix factorizations. EOS Some applications include: we refine and establish the expected computation of 2-periodic Hochschild invariants of matrix factorizations;	we show that the category of matrix factorizations is smooth, and is proper when the critical locus is proper;
doc	Sub-linear Upper Bounds on Fourier dimension of Boolean Functions in terms of Fourier sparsity EOS We prove that the Fourier dimension of any Boolean function with Fourier sparsity _EQN_ is at most _EQN_. EOS Our proof method yields an improved bound of _EQN_ assuming a conjecture of Tsang~\etal~ REF, that for every Boolean function of sparsity _EQN_ there is an affine subspace of _EQN_ of co-dimension _EQN_ restricted to which the function is constant.	This conjectured bound is tight upto poly-logarithmic factors as the Fourier dimension and sparsity of the address function are quadratically separated.

doc	Habitability of waterworlds: runaway greenhouses, atmospheric expansion and multiple climate states of pure water atmospheres EOS There are four different stable climate states for pure water atmospheres, as might exist on so-called "waterworlds". EOS I map these as a function of solar constant for planets ranging in size from Mars size to 10 Earth-mass. EOS The states are: globally ice covered (Ts< 245K), cold and damp (270 < Ts< 290K), hot and moist (350< Ts< 550K) and very hot and dry (Ts< 900K). EOS No stable climate exists for 290< Ts < 350K or 550 < Ts < 900K. EOS The union of hot moist and cold damp climates describe the liquid water habitable zone, the width and location of which depends on planet mass. EOS At each solar constant, two or three different climate states are stable. EOS This is a consequence of strong non-linearities in both thermal emission and the net absorption of sunlight. EOS Across the range of planet sizes, I account for the atmospheres expanding to high altitudes as they warm.	The emitting and absorbing surfaces (optical depth of unity) move to high altitude, making their area larger than the planet surface, so more thermal radiation is emitted and more sunlight absorbed (the former dominates).

doc	The Optically Unbiased Gamma-Ray Burst Host (TOUGH) Survey. VII. The Host Galaxy Luminosity Function: Probing the Relationship Between GRBs and Star Formation to Redshift _EQN_ EOS Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offer a route to characterizing star-forming galaxies and quantifying high- _EQN_ star formation that is distinct from the approach of traditional galaxy surveys: GRB selection is independent of dust and probes even the faintest galaxies that can evade detection in flux-limited surveys. EOS However, the exact relation between the GRB rate and the star formation rate (SFR) throughout all redshifts is controversial. EOS The Optically Unbiased GRB Host (TOUGH) survey includes observations of all GRB hosts (69) in an optically unbiased sample of Swift GRBs and we utilize these to constrain the evolution of the UV GRB-host-galaxy luminosity function (LF) between _EQN_ and _EQN_, and compare this with LFs derived from both Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) surveys and simulation modeling. EOS At all redshifts we find the GRB hosts to be most consistent with a luminosity function derived from SFR weighted models incorporating GRB production via both metallicity-dependent and independent channels with a relatively high level of bias toward low metallicity hosts.	In the range _EQN_ an SFR weighted LBG derived (i.e., non-metallicity biased) LF is also a reasonable fit to the data.

doc	A Finite-Volume Scheme for a Spinorial Matrix Drift-Diffusion Model for Semiconductors EOS An implicit Euler finite-volume scheme for a spinorial matrix drift-diffusion model for semiconductors is analyzed. EOS The model consists of strongly coupled parabolic equations for the electron density matrix or, alternatively, of weakly coupled equations for the charge and spin-vector densities, coupled to the Poisson equation for the elec-tric potential. EOS The equations are solved in a bounded domain with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. EOS The charge and spin-vector fluxes are approximated by a Scharfetter-Gummel discretization. EOS The main features of the numerical scheme are the preservation of positivity and L _EQN_ bounds and the dissipation of the discrete free energy. EOS The existence of a bounded discrete solution and the monotonicity of the discrete free energy are proved. EOS For undoped semiconductor materials, the numerical scheme is uncon-ditionally stable. EOS The fundamental ideas are reformulations using spin-up and spin-down densities and certain projections of the spin-vector density, free energy estimates, and a discrete Moser iteration.	Furthermore, numerical simulations of a simple ferromagnetic-layer field-effect transistor in two space dimensions are presented.
doc	Intermediate mass excess of dilepton production in heavy ion collisions at BEVALAC energies EOS Dielectron mass spectra are examined for various nuclear reactions recently measured by the DLS collaboration. EOS A detailed description is given of all dilepton channels included in the transport model UrQMD 1.0, i.e. EOS Dalitz decays of _EQN_ mesons and of the _EQN_ resonance, direct decays of vector mesons and _EQN_ bremsstrahlung.	The microscopic calculations reproduce data for light systems fairly well, but tend to underestimate the data in _EQN_ at high energies and in _EQN_ at low energies.
doc	Steady states, squeezing, and entanglement in intracavity triplet down conversion EOS Triplet down conversion, the process of converting one high-energy photon into three low-energy photons, may soon be experimentally feasible due to advances in optical resonator technology. EOS We use quantum phase-space techniques to analyse the process of degenerate intracavity triplet down conversion by solving stochastic differential equations within the truncated positive-P representation. EOS The time evolution of both intracavity mode populations are simulated, and the resulting steady-states are examined as a function of the pump intensity. EOS Quantum effects are most pronounced in the region immediately above the semi-classical pumping threshold, where our numerical results differ significantly from semi-classical predictions.	Regimes of measurable squeezing and bipartite entanglement are identified from steady-state spectra of the cavity output fields.
doc	Observational effects of magnetism in O stars: surface nitrogen abundances EOS We investigate the surface nitrogen content of the six magnetic O stars known to date as well as of the early B-type star tau Sco. EOS We compare these abundances to predictions of evolutionary models to isolate the effects of magnetic field on the transport of elements in stellar interiors. EOS We conduct a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the sample stars with state-of-the-art atmosphere models. EOS We rely on high signal-to-noise ratio, high resolution optical spectra obtained with ESPADONS at CFHT and NARVAL at TBL. EOS Atmosphere models and synthetic spectra are computed with the code CMFGEN. EOS Values of N/H together with their uncertainties are determined and compared to predictions of evolutionary models. EOS We find that the magnetic stars can be divided into two groups: one with stars displaying no N enrichment (one object); EOS and one with stars most likely showing extra N enrichment (5 objects).	For one star (Theta1 Ori C) no robust conclusion can be drawn due to its young age.

doc	The process of data formation for the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) in Solar Orbiter EOS The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) is a hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy device to be mounted in the Solar Orbiter cluster with the aim of providing images and spectra of solar flaring regions at different photon energies in the range from a few keV to around 150 keV. EOS The imaging modality of this telescope is based on the Moire pattern concept and utilizes 30 sub-collimators, each one containing a pair of co-axial grids. EOS This paper applies Fourier analysis to provide the first rigorous description of the data formation process in STIX.	Specifically, we show that, under first harmonic approximation, the integrated counts measured by STIX sub-collimators can be interpreted as specific spatial Fourier components of the incoming photon flux, named visibilities.
doc	Photometric properties of new solar H alpha commercial Fabry-Perot etalons. Application to the analysis of the chromospheric fringe EOS We consider the use of the commercially available Fabry-Perot etalons (FP) for the imaging of the solar chromosphere in the H alpha line of HI. EOS Three etalons of 40, 60 and 90 mm diameter were accurately analysed. EOS At normal incidence the maximum transmission wavelength as well as the finesse were evaluated. EOS Polynomial curves precisely fitting the transmitted central wavelength variations when using a quasi-parallel beam from a point-like source are presented. EOS Further calibrations have been done with photometric accuracy using a laboratory set-up comprising i/ a 16 bits CCD camera; EOS ii/ a Littrow spectrograph of a spectral power 110000 giving a linear dispersion of 0.0058 nm/pixel and iii/ an artificial Sun used as a light source and iv/ precisely adjustable in position optical components, including the F-P etalons. EOS In addition, a precise laboratory wavelength calibration was performed using a low pressure deuterium 2D spectral lamp simultaneously illuminating the adjustable entrance slit using a splitter before. EOS The variations of the FWHM of the spectral transmission variations as a function of the incidence angle of a parallel beam are also given for each etalon.	Consequences resulting from the use of a low but significant aperture/ratio are tentatively discussed for the first time.

doc	A High Resolution X-ray Image of the Jet in M 87 EOS We present the first high resolution X-ray image of the jet in M 87 using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. EOS There is clear structure in the jet and almost all of the optically bright knots are detected individually. EOS The unresolved core is the brightest X-ray feature but is only 2-3 times brighter than knot A (12.3" from the core) and the inner knot HST-1 (1.0" from the core).	The X-ray and optical positions of the knots are consistent at the 0.1" level but the X-ray emission from the brightest knot (A) is marginally upstream of the optical emission peak.

doc	Elastic Properties of Nanowires EOS We present a model to study Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the composite material of amorphous nanowires. EOS It is an extension of the model derived by two of us [Da Fonseca and Galvao, Phys. EOS Rev. EOS Lett. EOS 92, 175502 (2004)] to study the elastic properties of amorphous nanosprings. EOS The model is based on twisting and tensioning a straight nanowire and we propose an experimental setup to obtain the elastic parameters of the nanowire.	We used the Kirchhoff rod model to obtain the expressions for the elastic constants of the nanowire.
doc	Dark matter annihilation and decay profiles for the Reticulum II dwarf spheroidal galaxy EOS The dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) of the Milky Way are among the most attractive targets for indirect searches of dark matter. EOS In this work, we reconstruct the dark matter annihilation (J-factor) and decay profiles for the newly discovered dSph Reticulum II. EOS Using an optimized spherical Jeans analysis of kinematic data obtained from the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS), we find Reticulum II's J-factor to be among the largest of any Milky Way dSph.	We have checked the robustness of this result against several ingredients of the analysis.
doc	Formation of disks with long-lived spiral arms from violent gravitational dynamics EOS By means of simple dynamical experiments we study the combined effect of gravitational and gas dynamics in the evolution of an initially out-of-equilibrium, uniform and rotating massive over-density thought of as in isolation. EOS The rapid variation of the system mean-field potential makes the point like particles (PPs), which interact only via Newtonian gravity, form a quasistationary thick disk dominated by rotational motions surrounded by far out-of-equilibrium spiral arms. EOS On the other side, the gas component is subjected to compression shocks and radiative cooling so as to develop a much flatter disk, where rotational motions are coherent and the velocity dispersion is smaller than that of PPs.	Around such gaseous disk long-lived, but nonstationary, spiral arms form: these are made of gaseous particles that move coherently because have acquired a specific phase-space correlation during the gravitational collapse phase.
doc	Evidences of a threshold system as the source for magnetic storms detected on Earth s surface EOS Threshold systems appear to underlie the global behaviour of physical phenomena very unlike at a first look. EOS The usual experimental fingerprint of threshold system grounded phenomena is the presence of power laws. EOS Experimental evidence has been found, for example, in superconductor vortex avalanches, sand piles, the brain, 4He superfluidity and earthquakes.	Double power-laws have been found in social networks, in the luminosity of some galactic nuclei and, very recently, in solar flares, among others.
doc	An efficient methodology to estimate the parameters of a two-dimensional chirp signal model EOS In various capacities of statistical signal processing two-dimensional (2-D) chirp models have been considered significantly, particularly in image processing _EQN_ to model gray-scale and texture images, magnetic resonance imaging, optical imaging etc. EOS In this paper we address the problem of estimation of the unknown parameters of a 2-D chirp model under the assumption that the errors are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.).	The key attribute of the proposed estimation procedure is that it is computationally more efficient than the least squares estimation method.
doc	Stellar Parameters for HD 69830, a Nearby Star with Three Neptune Mass Planets and an Asteroid Belt EOS We used the CHARA Array to directly measure the angular diameter of HD 69830, home to three Neptune mass planets and an asteroid belt. EOS Our measurement of 0.674+/-0.014 milli-arcseconds for the limb-darkened angular diameter of this star leads to a physical radius of R _EQN_ = 0.9058 _EQN_ 0.0190 R\sun and luminosity of L* = 0.622+/-0.014 Lsun when combined with a fit to the spectral energy distribution of the star. EOS Placing these observed values on an Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram along with stellar evolution isochrones produces an age of 10.6+/-4 Gyr and mass of 0.863 _EQN_ 0.043 M\sun.	We use archival optical echelle spectra of HD 69830 along with an iterative spectral fitting technique to measure the iron abundance ([Fe/H]=-0.04+/-0.03), effective temperature (5385+/-44 K) and surface gravity (log g = 4.49+/-0.06).
doc	A Closer Look at the Alpha Persei Coronal Conundrum EOS A ROSAT survey of the Alpha Per open cluster in 1993 detected its brightest star, mid-F supergiant Alpha Persei: the X-ray luminosity and spectral hardness were similar to coronally active late-type dwarf members. EOS Later, in 2010, a Hubble Cosmic Origins Spectrograph SNAPshot of Alpha Persei found far-ultraviolet coronal proxy SiIV unexpectedly weak. EOS This, and a suspicious offset of the ROSAT source, suggested that a late-type companion might be responsible for the X-rays. EOS Recently, a multi-faceted program tested that premise. EOS Groundbased optical coronography, and near-UV imaging with HST Wide Field Camera 3, searched for any close-in faint candidate coronal objects, but without success. EOS Then, a Chandra pointing found the X-ray source single and coincident with the bright star. EOS Significantly, the SiIV emissions of Alpha Persei, in a deeper FUV spectrum collected by HST COS as part of the joint program, aligned well with chromospheric atomic oxygen (which must be intrinsic to the luminous star), within the context of cooler late-F and early-G supergiants, including Cepheid variables. EOS This pointed to the X-rays as the fundamental anomaly. EOS The over-luminous X-rays still support the case for a hyperactive dwarf secondary, albeit now spatially unresolved. EOS However, an alternative is that Alpha Persei represents a novel class of coronal source.	Resolving the first possibility now has become more difficult, because the easy solution -- a well separated companion -- has been eliminated.
doc	Vehicle Detection in Aerial Images EOS The detection of vehicles in aerial images is widely applied in many applications. EOS Comparing with object detection in the ground view images, vehicle detection in aerial images remains a challenging problem because of small vehicle size, monotone appearance and the complex background. EOS In this paper, we propose a novel double focal loss convolutional neural network framework (DFL-CNN). EOS In the proposed framework, the skip connection is used in the CNN structure to enhance the feature learning. EOS Also, the focal loss function is used to substitute for conventional cross entropy loss function in both of the region proposed network and the final classifier. EOS We further introduce the first large-scale vehicle detection dataset ITCVD with ground truth annotations for all the vehicles in the scene. EOS We demonstrate the performance of our model on the existing benchmark DLR 3K dataset as well as the ITCVD dataset.	The experimental results show that our DFL-CNN outperforms the baselines on vehicle detection.

doc	Leptogenesis in a perturbative SO(10) model EOS We consider a phenomenologically viable SO(10) grand unification model which allows perturbative calculations up to the Planck scale or the string scale. EOS We use a set of Higgs superfields 10 + 16bar + 16 + 45. EOS In this framework, the data fitting of the charged fermion mass matrices is re-examined. EOS This model can indeed reproduce the low-energy experimental data relating the charged fermion masses and mixings. EOS As for the neutrino sector, we take the neutrino oscillation data as input data to construct right-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix and get a prediction for the physics related to the right-handed neutrinos, e.g. EOS the leptogenesis and for the proton decay. EOS We propose two kinds of phenomenologically viable model, quoted as Model 1 and Model 2.	We show that one of the models (Model 2) is consistent with all experimental constraints.
doc	Early Optical Observations of GRB 150910A: Bright Jet Optical Afterglow and X-ray Dipole Radiation from a Magnetar Central Engine EOS Gamma-ray burst (GRB) 150910A was detected by Swift /BAT, and then rapidly observed by Swift /XRT, Swift /UVOT, and ground-based telescopes. EOS We report Lick Observatory spectroscopic and photometric observations of GRB~150910A, and we investigate the physical origins of both the optical and X-ray afterglows, incorporating data obtained with BAT and XRT. EOS The light curves show that the jet emission episode lasts _EQN_ ~s with a sharp pulse from BAT to XRT (Episode I).	In Episode II, the optical emission has a smooth onset bump followed by a normal decay (_EQN_), as predicted in the standard external shock model, while the X-ray emission exhibits a plateau (_EQN_) followed by a steep decay (_EQN_).
doc	Evidence for an Intermediate Mass Black Hole in NGC 5408 X-1 EOS We report the discovery with XMM-Newton of correlated spectral and timing behavior in the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 5408 X-1. EOS An ~100 ksec pointing with XMM/Newton obtained in January, 2008 reveals a strong 10 mHz QPO in the > 1 keV flux, as well as flat-topped, band limited noise breaking to a power law. EOS The energy spectrum is again dominated by two components, a 0.16 keV thermal disk and a power-law with an index of ~2.5. EOS These new measurements, combined with results from our previous January 2006 pointing in which we first detected QPOs, show for the first time in a ULX a pattern of spectral and temporal correlations strongly analogous to that seen in Galactic black hole sources, but at much higher X-ray luminosity and longer characteristic time-scales.	We find that the QPO frequency is proportional to the inferred disk flux, while the QPO and broad-band noise amplitude (root mean squared, rms) are inversely proportional to the disk flux.
doc	On multicomponent polariton superfluidity in the optical parametric oscillator regime EOS Superfluidity, the ability of a liquid or gas to flow with zero viscosity, is one of the most remarkable implications of collective quantum coherence. EOS In equilibrium systems like liquid 4He and ultracold atomic gases, superfluid behaviour conjugates diverse yet related phenomena, such as persistency of metastable flow in multiply connected geometries and the existence of a critical velocity for frictionless flow when hitting a static defect. EOS The link between these different aspects of superfluid behaviour is far less clear in driven-dissipative systems displaying collective coherence, such as microcavity polaritons, which raises important questions about their concurrency.	With a joint theoretical and experimental study, we show that the scenario is particularly rich for polaritons driven in a three-fluid collective coherent regime so-called optical parametric oscillator.

doc	Unsupervised Learning of Monocular Depth Estimation with Bundle Adjustment, Super-Resolution and Clip Loss EOS We present a novel unsupervised learning framework for single view depth estimation using monocular videos. EOS It is well known in 3D vision that enlarging the baseline can increase the depth estimation accuracy, and jointly optimizing a set of camera poses and landmarks is essential. EOS In previous monocular unsupervised learning frameworks, only part of the photometric and geometric constraints within a sequence are used as supervisory signals. EOS This may result in a short baseline and overfitting. EOS Besides, previous works generally estimate a low resolution depth from a low resolution impute image. EOS The low resolution depth is then interpolated to recover the original resolution. EOS This strategy may generate large errors on object boundaries, as the depth of background and foreground are mixed to yield the high resolution depth. EOS In this paper, we introduce a bundle adjustment framework and a super-resolution network to solve the above two problems. EOS In bundle adjustment, depths and poses of an image sequence are jointly optimized, which increases the baseline by establishing the relationship between farther frames.	The super resolution network learns to estimate a high resolution depth from a low resolution image.
doc	Vertex Isoperimetric Inequalities for a Family of Graphs on Z^k EOS We consider the family of graphs whose vertex set is Z^k where two vertices are connected by an edge when their l\infty-distance is 1. EOS We prove the optimal vertex isoperimetric inequality for this family of graphs. EOS That is, given a positive integer n, we find a set A \subset Z^k of size n such that the number of vertices who share an edge with some vertex in A is minimized. EOS These sets of minimal boundary are nested, and the proof uses the technique of compression.	We also show a method of calculating the vertex boundary for certain subsets in this family of graphs.
doc	Beyond Leaderboards: A survey of methods for revealing weaknesses in Natural Language Inference data and models EOS Recent years have seen a growing number of publications that analyse Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets for superficial cues, whether they undermine the complexity of the tasks underlying those datasets and how they impact those models that are optimised and evaluated on this data. EOS This structured survey provides an overview of the evolving research area by categorising reported weaknesses in models and datasets and the methods proposed to reveal and alleviate those weaknesses for the English language.	We summarise and discuss the findings and conclude with a set of recommendations for possible future research directions.
doc	Prospects for Detecting Supernova Neutrino Flavor Oscillations EOS The neutrinos from a Type II supernova provide perhaps our best opportunity to probe cosmologically interesting muon and/or tauon neutrino masses. EOS This is because matter enhanced neutrino oscillations can lead to an anomalously hot nu_e spectrum, and thus to enhanced charged current cross sections in terrestrial detectors. EOS Two recently proposed supernova neutrino observatories, OMNIS and LAND, will detect neutrons spalled from target nuclei by neutral and charged current neutrino interactions.	As this signal is not flavor specific, it is not immediately clear whether a convincing neutrino oscillation signal can be extracted from such experiments.
doc	Evidence for Relativistic Disk Reflection in the Seyfert 1h Galaxy/ULIRG IRAS 05189-2524 Observed by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton EOS We present a spectral analysis of the NuSTAR and XMM-Newton observations of the Seyfert 1h galaxy/ULIRG IRAS 05189-2524 taken in 2013. EOS We find evidence for relativistic disk reflection in the broadband X-ray spectrum: a highly asymmetric broad Fe K _EQN_ emission line extending down to 3 keV and a Compton scattering component above 10 keV. EOS Physical modeling with a self-consistent disk reflection model suggests the accretion disk is viewed at an intermediate angle with a super-solar iron abundance, and a mild constraint can be put on the high-energy cutoff of the power-law continuum. EOS We test the disk reflection modeling under different absorption scenarios.	A rapid black hole (BH) spin is favored, however we cannot place a model-independent tight constraint on the value.
doc	Synthetic High-Resolution Line Spectra of Star-Forming Galaxies Below 1200A EOS We have generated a set of far-ultraviolet stellar libraries using spectra of OB and Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galaxy and the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud. EOS The spectra were collected with the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer and cover a wavelength range from 1003.1 to 1182.7A at a resolution of 0.127A. EOS The libraries extend from the earliest O- to late-O and early-B stars for the Magellanic Cloud and Galactic libraries, respectively. EOS Attention is paid to the complex blending of stellar and interstellar lines, which can be significant, especially in models using Galactic stars. EOS The most severe contamination is due to molecular hydrogen. EOS Using a simple model for the H _EQN_ line strength, we were able to remove the molecular hydrogen lines in a subset of Magellanic Cloud stars. EOS Variations of the photospheric and wind features of CIII 1176, OVI 1032, 1038, PV 1118, 1128, and SIV 1063, 1073, 1074 are discussed as a function of temperature and luminosity class.	The spectral libraries were implemented into the LavalSB and Starburst99 packages and used to compute a standard set of synthetic spectra of star-forming galaxies.

doc	_EQN_ -Ward identities for QCD with restored chiral symmetry EOS Lattice studies of QCD at temperatures above the chiral restoration and QCD with truncated low modes of the Dirac operator indicate approximate and explicit _EQN_ degeneracies in hadron spectra, respectively. EOS At the same time, the QCD classical action and the path integral measure are not invariant under _EQN_. EOS Here we investigate _EQN_ transformations in the continuum limit by deriving corresponding Ward identities.	We show that, if there is a gap in low-lying modes of the Dirac operator the obtained _EQN_ Ward identities are simplified and look like they would be if _EQN_ symmetry is preserved.

Then, we have extended the one-dimensional code to a multi-dimensional IMHD code through a Strang-type dimensional splitting.
doc	Universality of the gauge-ball spectrum of the four-dimensional pure U(1) gauge theory EOS We continue numerical studies of the spectrum of the pure U(1) lattice gauge theory in the confinement phase, initiated in our previous work. EOS Using the extended Wilson action _EQN_ we address the question of universality of the phase transition line in the (_EQN_) plane between the confinement and the Coulomb phases. EOS Our present results at _EQN_ for the gauge-ball spectrum are fully consistent with the previous results obtained at _EQN_. EOS Again, two different correlation length exponents, _EQN_ and _EQN_, are obtained in different channels. EOS We also confirm the stability of the values of these exponents with respect to the variation of the distance from the critical point at which they are determined.	These results further demonstrate universal critical behaviour of the model at least up to correlation lengths of 4 lattice spacings when the phase transition is approached in some interval at _EQN_.

doc	The impact of relativistic effects on cosmological parameter estimation EOS Future surveys will access large volumes of space and hence very long wavelength fluctuations of the matter density and gravitational field. EOS It has been argued that the set of secondary effects that affect the galaxy distribution, relativistic in nature, will bring new, complementary cosmological constraints. EOS We study this claim in detail by focusing on a subset of wide-area future surveys: Stage-4 cosmic microwave background experiments and photometric redshift surveys. EOS In particular, we look at the magnification lensing contribution to galaxy clustering and general relativistic corrections to all observables. EOS We quantify the amount of information encoded in these effects in terms of the tightening of the final cosmological constraints as well as the potential bias in inferred parameters associated with neglecting them.	We do so for a wide range of cosmological parameters, covering neutrino masses, standard dark-energy parametrizations and scalar-tensor gravity theories.
doc	Optically induced coherent transport far above Tc in underdoped YBa2Cu3O6+x EOS We report on a photo-induced transient state of YBa2Cu2O6+x in which transport perpendicular to the Cu-O planes becomes highly coherent. EOS This effect is achieved by excitation with mid-infrared optical pulses, tuned to the resonant frequency of apical oxygen vibrations, which modulate both lattice and electronic properties. EOS Below the superconducting transition temperature Tc, the equilibrium signatures of superconducting interlayer coupling are enhanced. EOS Most strikingly, the optical excitation induces a new reflectivity edge at higher frequency than the equilibrium Josephson plasma resonance, with a concomitant enhancement of the low frequency imaginary conductivity. EOS Above Tc, the incoherent equilibrium conductivity becomes highly coherent, with the appearance of a reflectivity edge and a positive imaginary conductivity that increases with decreasing frequency.	These features are observed up to room temperature in YBa2Cu2O6.45 and YBa2Cu2O6.5.

EOS There are 60 (35) GRBs in our X-ray (optical) sample, mostly from Swift. EOS We use two methods to study epsilon_B (fraction of energy in magnetic field in the FS). EOS 1. EOS For the X-ray sample, we use the constraint that the observed flux at the end of the steep decline is _EQN_ the X-ray FS flux. EOS 2. EOS For the optical sample, we use the condition that the observed flux arises from the FS (optical sample light curves decline as ~t^-1, as expected for the FS). EOS Making a reasonable assumption on E (jet isotropic equivalent kinetic energy), we converted these conditions into an upper limit (measurement) on epsilon_B n^ 2/(p+1) for our X-ray (optical) sample, where n is the circumburst density and p is the electron index.	Taking n=1 cm^-3, the distribution of epsilon_B measurements (upper limits) for our optical (X-ray) sample has a range of ~10^-8 -10^-3 (~10^-6 -10^-3) and median of ~few x 10^-5 (~few x 10^-5).
doc	The Birth of _EQN_ out of the Spinors of the Icosahedron EOS _EQN_ is prominent in mathematics and theoretical physics, and is generally viewed as an exceptional symmetry in an eight-dimensional space very different from the space we inhabit; EOS for instance the Lie group _EQN_ features heavily in ten-dimensional superstring theory. EOS Contrary to that point of view, here we show that the _EQN_ root system can in fact be constructed from the icosahedron alone and can thus be viewed purely in terms of three-dimensional geometry. EOS The _EQN_ roots of _EQN_ arise in the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D space as a double cover of the _EQN_ elements of the icosahedral group, generated by the root system _EQN_. EOS As a by-product, by restricting to even products of root vectors (spinors) in the 4D even subalgebra of the Clifford algebra, one can show that each 3D root system induces a root system in 4D, which turn out to also be exactly the exceptional 4D root systems.	The spinorial point of view explains their existence as well as their unusual automorphism groups.

doc	An Empirical Analysis of the Python Package Index (PyPI) EOS In this research, we provide a comprehensive empirical summary of the Python Package Repository, PyPI, including both package metadata and source code covering 178,592 packages, 1,745,744 releases, 76,997 contributors, and 156,816,750 import statements. EOS We provide counts and trends for packages, releases, dependencies, category classifications, licenses, and package imports, as well as authors, maintainers, and organizations. EOS As one of the largest and oldest software repositories as of publication, PyPI provides insight not just into the Python ecosystem today, but also trends in software development and licensing more broadly over time.	Within PyPI, we find that the growth of the repository has been robust under all measures, with a compound annual growth rate of 47% for active packages, 39% for new authors, and 61% for new import statements over the last 15 years.
doc	Thermal Casimir force between nanostructured surfaces EOS We present detailed calculations for the Casimir force between a plane and a nanostructured surface at finite temperature in the framework of the scattering theory. EOS We then study numerically the effect of finite temperature as a function of the grating parameters and the separation distance.	We also infer non-trivial geometrical effects on the Casimir interaction via a comparison with the proximity force approximation.
doc	Binary galaxies and alternative physics. I. A qualitative application of MOND and Mannheim-Kazanas gravity EOS Binary galaxies are modeled as point-masses obeying the non-Newtonian MOND and Mannheim-Kazanas (MKG) theories of gravity. EOS Random samples of such systems are generated by means of Monte Carlo simulations of binary orbits. EOS Model pairs have total masses and mass ratios similar to pairs in the cataloged sample used in the analysis. EOS General features of synthetic samples are derived from a comparison with observed data of galaxy pairs in _EQN_ space. EOS Both MOND and Mannheim-Kazanas binaries either on circular or low-eccentricity orbits cannot be the source of observations because they require extremely high _EQN_ values (_EQN_ 45 solar units). EOS Both MOND and MKG binaries on high-eccentricity orbits and reasonable _EQN_ values (5 solar units) produce envelopes of _EQN_ consistent with the observations, but the distribution of separations is inconsistent with the observed data, unless strong selection effects are at work.	A definite answer to the issue whether one or another model is suitable to explain real binary galaxy dynamics will be only possible when a large sample containing a significant fraction of wide pairs, determined with velocity-blind selection procedures, is investigated under a rigorous statistical analysis, taking into account sample selection biases and contamination by non-physical pairs.
doc	Region-specific Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping EOS We introduce a region-specific diffeomorphic metric mapping (RDMM) registration approach. EOS RDMM is non-parametric, estimating spatio-temporal velocity fields which parameterize the sought-for spatial transformation. EOS Regularization of these velocity fields is necessary. EOS However, while existing non-parametric registration approaches, e.g., the large displacement diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) model, use a fixed spatially-invariant regularization our model advects a spatially-varying regularizer with the estimated velocity field, thereby naturally attaching a spatio-temporal regularizer to deforming objects. EOS We explore a family of RDMM registration approaches: 1) a registration model where regions with separate regularizations are pre-defined (e.g., in an atlas space), 2) a registration model where a general spatially-varying regularizer is estimated, and 3) a registration model where the spatially-varying regularizer is obtained via an end-to-end trained deep learning (DL) model. EOS We provide a variational derivation of RDMM, show that the model can assure diffeomorphic transformations in the continuum, and that LDDMM is a particular instance of RDMM. EOS To evaluate RDMM performance we experiment 1) on synthetic 2D data and 2) on two 3D datasets: knee magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and computed tomography images (CT) of the lung. EOS Results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art image registration performance, while providing additional information via a learned spatio-temoporal regularizer. EOS Further, our deep learning approach allows for very fast RDMM and LDDMM estimations. EOS Our code will be open-sourced.	Code is available at https://github.com/uncbiag/registration.
doc	Irreversible Monte Carlo Algorithms for Efficient Sampling EOS Equilibrium systems evolve according to Detailed Balance (DB). EOS This principe guided development of the Monte-Carlo sampling techniques, of which Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm is the famous representative. EOS It is also known that DB is sufficient but not necessary. EOS We construct irreversible deformation of a given reversible algorithm capable of dramatic improvement of sampling from known distribution.	Our transformation modifies transition rates keeping the structure of transitions intact.
doc	Triggering Collapse of the Presolar Dense Cloud Core and Injecting Short-Lived Radioisotopes with a Shock Wave. II. Varied Shock Wave and Cloud Core Parameters EOS A variety of stellar sources have been proposed for the origin of the short-lived radioisotopes that existed at the time of the formation of the earliest Solar System solids, including Type II supernovae, AGB and super-AGB stars, and Wolf-Rayet star winds. EOS Our previous adaptive mesh hydrodynamics models with the FLASH2.5 code have shown which combinations of shock wave parameters are able to simultaneously trigger the gravitational collapse of a target dense cloud core and inject significant amounts of shock wave gas and dust, showing that thin supernova shocks may be uniquely suited for the task. EOS However, recent meteoritical studies have weakened the case for a direct supernova injection to the presolar cloud, motivating us to re-examine a wider range of shock wave and cloud core parameters, including rotation, in order to better estimate the injection efficiencies for a variety of stellar sources. EOS We find that supernova shocks remain as the most promising stellar source, though planetary nebulae resulting from AGB star evolution cannot be conclusively ruled out. EOS Wolf-Rayet star winds, however, are likely to lead to cloud core shredding, rather than to collapse.	Injection efficiencies can be increased when the cloud is rotating about an axis aligned with the direction of the shock wave, by as much as a factor of _EQN_.
doc	High-dimensional instrumental variables regression and confidence sets EOS This article considers inference in linear models with d\_X regressors, some or many of which could be endogenous, and d\_Z instrumental variables (IVs). EOS d\_Z can range from less than d\_X to any order smaller than an exponential in the sample size. EOS For moderate d\_X, identification robust confidence sets are obtained by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite programs. EOS For large d\_X, we propose the STIV estimator. EOS The analysis of its error uses sensitivity characteristics introduced in this paper. EOS Robust confidence sets are derived by solving linear programs.	Results on rates of convergence, variable selection, and confidence sets which "adapt" to the sparsity are given.
doc	Weyl-loop half metal in Li _EQN_ (FeO _EQN_) _EQN_ EOS Nodal-line metals and semimetals, as interesting topological states of matter, have been mostly studied in nonmagnetic materials. EOS Here, based on first-principles calculations and symmetry analysis, we predict that fully spin-polarized Weyl loops can be realized in the half metal state for the three-dimensional material Li _EQN_ (FeO _EQN_) _EQN_.	We show that this material has a ferromagnetic ground state, and it is a half metal with only a single spin channel present near the Fermi level.
doc	Faint blue objects on the Hubble Deep Field North & South as possible nearby old halo white dwarfs EOS Using data derived from the deepest and finest angular resolution images of the universe yet acquired by astronomers at optical wavelengths using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in two postage-stamp sections of the sky (Williams et al 1996a,b), plus simple geometrical and scaling arguments, we demonstrate that the faint blue population of point-source objects detected on those two fields (M\'endez et al 1996) could actually be ancient halo white dwarfs at distances closer than about 2 kpc from the Sun. EOS This finding has profound implications, as the mass density of the detected objects would account for about half of the missing dark matter in the Milky-Way (Bahcall and Soneira 1980), thus solving one of the most controversial issues of modern astrophysics (Trimble 1987, Ashman 1992). EOS The existence of these faint blue objects points to a very large mass locked into ancient halo white dwarfs.	Our estimate indicates that they could account for as much as half of the dark matter in our Galaxy, confirming the suggestions of the MACHO microlensing experiment (Alcock et al 1997).

The suppression of the transverse mode coupling instability by the space charge is explained.

doc	Black holes in asymptotically Lifshitz spacetime EOS A model of 3+1 dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant coupled to abelian gauge fields has been proposed as a gravity dual for Lifshitz like critical phenomena in 2+1 dimensions. EOS The finite temperature behavior is described by black holes that are asymptotic to the Lifshitz fixed point geometry. EOS There is a one-parameter family of charged black holes, where the magnitude of the charge is uniquely determined by the black hole area.	These black holes are thermodynamically stable and become extremal in the limit of vanishing size.

doc	Anti-hierarchical evolution of the Active Galactic Nucleus space density in a hierarchical universe EOS Recent observations show that the space density of luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) peaks at higher redshifts than that of faint AGNs. EOS This downsizing trend in the AGN evolution seems to be contradictory to the hierarchical structure formation scenario. EOS In this study, we present the AGN space density evolution predicted by a semi-analytic model of galaxy and AGN formation based on the hierarchical structure formation scenario. EOS We demonstrate that our model can reproduce the downsizing trend of the AGN space density evolution. EOS The reason for the downsizing trend in our model is a combination of the cold gas depletion as a consequence of star formation, the gas cooling suppression in massive halos and the AGN lifetime scaling with the dynamical timescale. EOS We assume that a major merger of galaxies causes a starburst, spheroid formation, and cold gas accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH).	We also assume that this cold gas accretion triggers AGN activity.
doc	Extraordinary Magnetoresistance in Hybrid Semiconductor-Metal Systems EOS We show that extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) arises in systems consisting of two components; EOS a semiconducting ring with a metallic inclusion embedded. EOS The im- portant aspect of this discovery is that the system must have a quasi-two-dimensional character. EOS Using the same materials and geometries for the samples as in experiments by Solin et al[1; EOS 2], we show that such systems indeed exhibit a huge magnetoresistance. EOS The magnetoresistance arises due to the switching of electrical current paths passing through the metallic inclusion. EOS Diagrams illustrating the flow of the current density within the samples are utilised in discussion of the mechanism responsible for the magnetoresistance effect. EOS Extensions are then suggested which may be applicable to the silver chalcogenides.	Our theory offers an excellent description and explanation of experiments where a huge magnetoresistance has been discovered[2;
doc	Polymorphism, crystal nucleation and growth in the phase-field crystal model in 2d and 3d EOS We apply a simple dynamical density functional theory, the phase-field crystal (PFC) model of overdamped conservative dynamics, to address polymorphism, crystal nucleation, and crystal growth in the diffusion-controlled limit. EOS We refine the phase diagram for 3d, and determine the line free energy in 2d, the height of the nucleation barrier in 2d and 3d for homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation by solving the respective Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations. EOS We demonstrate that in the PFC model, the body-centered cubic (bcc), the face-centered cubic (fcc), and the hexagonal close packed structures (hcp) compete, while the simple cubic structure is unstable, and that phase preference can be tuned by changing the model parameters: close to the critical point the bcc structure is stable, while far from the critical point the fcc prevails, with an hcp stability domain in between. EOS We note that with increasing distance from the critical point the equilibrium shapes vary from sphere to the specific faceted shapes: rhombic-dodecahedron (bcc), truncated-octahedron (fcc), and hexagonal prism (hcp). EOS Solving the equation of motion of the PFC model supplied with conserved noise, solidification starts with the nucleation of an amorphous precursor phase, into which the stable crystalline phase nucleates. EOS The growth rate is found to be time dependent and anisotropic, which anisotropy depends on the driving force.	We show that due to the diffusion-controlled growth mechanism, which is especially relevant for crystal aggrega-tion in colloidal systems, dendritic growth structures evolve in large-scale isothermal single-component PFC simula-tions.
doc	Does the detection of X-ray emission from SN1998bw support its association with GRB980425?	We show that the recent identification of X-ray emission from SN1998bw is naturally explained as synchrotron emission from a shock driven into the wind surrounding the progenitor by a mildly relativistic shell ejected by the supernova, the existence of which was inferred earlier from radio observations.
doc	Slow quench dynamics of the Kitaev model: anisotropic critical point and effect of disorder EOS We study the non-equilibrium slow dynamics for the Kitaev model both in the presence and the absence of disorder. EOS For the case without disorder, we demonstrate, via an exact solution, that the model provides an example of a system with an anisotropic critical point and exhibits unusual scaling of defect density _EQN_ and residual energy _EQN_ for a slow linear quench. EOS We provide a general expression for the scaling of _EQN_ (_EQN_) generated during a slow power-law dynamics, characterized by a rate _EQN_ and exponent _EQN_, from a gapped phase to an anisotropic quantum critical point in _EQN_ dimensions, for which the energy gap _EQN_ for _EQN_ momentum components (_EQN_) and _EQN_ for the rest _EQN_ components (_EQN_) with _EQN_: _EQN_ (_EQN_).	These general expressions reproduce both the corresponding results for the Kitaev model as a special case for _EQN_ and _EQN_ and the well-known scaling laws of _EQN_ and _EQN_ for isotropic critical points for _EQN_.
doc	Improving the efficiency of the multireference driven similarity renormalization group via sequential transformation, density fitting, and the non-interacting virtual orbital approximation EOS This study examines several techniques to improve the efficiency of the linearized multireference driven similarity renormalization group truncated to one- and two-body operators [MR-LDSRG(2)]. EOS We propose a sequential MR-LDSRG(2) [sq-MR-LDSRG(2)] approach, in which one-body rotations are folded exactly into the Hamiltonian. EOS This new approach is combined with density fitting (DF) to reduce the storage cost of two-electron integrals. EOS To further avoid the storage of large four-index intermediates, we propose a non-interacting virtual orbit (NIVO) approximation in which tensor blocks labeled by three and four virtual indices are neglected. EOS The NIVO approximation reduces the computational cost prefactor of the MR-LDSRG(2) bringing it closer to that of coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD). EOS We test the effect of the DF and NIVO approximations on the MR-LDSRG(2) and sq-MR-LDSRG(2) methods by computing properties of eight diatomic molecules.	The diatomic constants obtained by DF-sq-MR-LDSRG(2)+NIVO are found to be as accurate as those from the original MR-LDSRG(2) and coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples.

doc	Massless Dirac Fermions Trapping in a Quasi-one-dimensional npn Junction of a Continuous Graphene Monolayer EOS Massless Dirac fermions in graphene provide unprecedented opportunities to realize the Klein paradox, which is one of the most exotic and striking properties of relativistic particles. EOS In the seminal theoretical work [Katsnelson et al, Nat. EOS Phys. EOS 2 620 (2006)], it was predicted that the massless Dirac fermions can pass through one-dimensional (1D) potential barriers unimpededly at normal incidence.	Such a result seems to preclude confinement of the massless Dirac fermions in graphene by using 1D potential barriers.
doc	On Quadratic g-Evaluations/Expectations and Related Analysis EOS In this paper we extend the notion of g-evaluation, in particular g-expectation, to the case where the generator g is allowed to have a quadratic growth. EOS We show that some important properties of the g-expectations, including a representation theorem between the generator and the corresponding g-expectation, and consequently the reverse comparison theorem of quadratic BSDEs as well as the Jensen inequality, remain true in the quadratic case.	Our main results also include a Doob-Meyer type decomposition, the optional sampling theorem, and the up-crossing inequality.

doc	Multifrequency Polarimetry of the Nrao 140 Jet: Possible Detection of a Helical Magnetic Field and Constraints on its Pitch Angle EOS We present results from multifrequency polarimetry of NRAO 140 using the Very Long Baseline Array. EOS These observations allow us to reveal the distributions of both the polarization position angle and the Faraday rotation measure (RM). EOS These distributions are powerful tools to discern the projected and line-of-sight components of the magnetic field, respectively. EOS We find a systematic gradient in the RM distribution, with its sign being opposite at either side of the jet with respect to the jet axis. EOS The sign of the RM changes only with the direction of the magnetic field component along the line of sight, so this can be explained by the existence of helical magnetic components associated with the jet itself.	We derive two constraints for the pitch angle of the helical magnetic field from the distributions of the RM and the projected magnetic field;
doc	Temperature-invariant Casimir-Polder forces despite large thermal photon numbers EOS We demonstrate that Casimir-Polder potentials can be entirely independent of temperature even when allowing for the thermal photon numbers to become large at the relevant molecular transition frequencies. EOS This statement holds for potentials that are due to low-energy transitions of a molecule placed near a plane metal surface. EOS For a molecule in an energy eigenstate, the temperature-invariance is a consequence of strong cancellations between nonresonant potential components and those due to evanescent waves. EOS For a molecule with a single dominant transition in a thermal state, upward and downward transitions combine to a temperature-independent potential.	The results are contrasted with the case of an atom whose potential exhibits a regime of linear temperature-dependence.
doc	Monopole Loop Suppression and Loss of Confinement in Restricted Action SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory EOS The effect of restricting the plaquette (_EQN_ Wilson loop) to be greater than a certain cutoff is studied. EOS The action considered is the standard Wilson action with the addition of the plaquette restriction, which does not affect the continuum limit. EOS A deconfining phase transition occurs as the cutoff is raised, even in the strong coupling limit.	Abelian-projected monopoles in the maximal abelian gauge are strongly suppressed by the action restriction.
doc	Topology and Signature Changes in Braneworlds EOS It has been believed that topology and signature change of the universe can only happen accompanied by singularities, in classical, or instantons, in quantum, gravity.

We supply some explicit examples of such cases, starting from the Dirac-Born-Infeld action.
doc	A Distribution of Large Particles in the Coma of Comet 103P/Hartley 2 EOS The coma of comet 103P/Hartley 2 has a significant population of large particles observed as point sources in images taken by the Deep Impact spacecraft. EOS We measure their spatial and flux distributions, and attempt to constrain their composition. EOS The flux distribution of these particles implies a very steep size distribution with power-law slopes ranging from -6.6 to -4.7. EOS The radii of the particles extend up to 20 cm, and perhaps up to 2 m, but their exact sizes depend on their unknown light scattering properties. EOS We consider two cases: bright icy material, and dark dusty material. EOS The icy case better describes the particles if water sublimation from the particles causes a significant rocket force, which we propose as the best method to account for the observed spatial distribution. EOS Solar radiation is a plausible alternative, but only if the particles are very low density aggregates. EOS If we treat the particles as mini-nuclei, we estimate they account for <16-80% of the comet's total water production rate (within 20.6 km). EOS Dark dusty particles, however, are not favored based on mass arguments. EOS The water production rate from bright icy particles is constrained with an upper limit of 0.1 to 0.5% of the total water production rate of the comet.	If indeed icy with a high albedo, these particles do not appear to account for the comet's large water production rate.
doc	Zarankiewicz's problem for semi-algebraic hypergraphs EOS Zarankiewicz's problem asks for the largest possible number of edges in a graph that does not contain a _EQN_ subgraph for a fixed positive integer _EQN_. EOS Recently, Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Sulk and Zahl considered this problem for semi-algebraic graphs, where vertices are points in _EQN_ and edges are defined by some semi-algebraic relations.	In this paper, we extend this idea to semi-algebraic hypergraphs.

doc	Kinematics of the swimming of Spiroplasma EOS ph Spiroplasma swimming is studied with a simple model based on resistive-force theory. EOS Specifically, we consider a bacterium shaped in the form of a helix that propagates traveling-wave distortions which flip the handedness of the helical cell body. EOS We treat cell length, pitch angle, kink velocity, and distance between kinks as parameters and calculate the swimming velocity that arises due to the distortions. EOS We find that, for a fixed pitch angle, scaling collapses the swimming velocity (and the swimming efficiency) to a universal curve that depends only on the ratio of the distance between kinks to the cell length.	Simultaneously optimizing the swimming efficiency with respect to inter-kink length and pitch angle, we find that the optimal pitch angle is 35.5 _EQN_ and the optimal inter-kink length ratio is 0.338, values in good agreement with experimental observations.
doc	Modern middleware for the data acquisition of the Cherenkov Telescope Array EOS The data acquisition system (DAQ) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) must be ef- ficient, modular and robust to be able to cope with the very large data rate of up to 550 Gbps coming from many telescopes with different characteristics. EOS The use of modern middleware, namely ZeroMQ and Protocol Buffers, can help to achieve these goals while keeping the development effort to a reasonable level. EOS Protocol Buffers are used as an on-line data for- mat, while ZeroMQ is employed to communicate between processes. EOS The DAQ will be controlled and monitored by the Alma Common Software (ACS). EOS Protocol Buffers from Google are a way to define high-level data structures through an in- terface description language (IDL) and a meta-compiler. EOS ZeroMQ is a middleware that augments the capabilities of TCP/IP sockets.	It does not implement very high-level features like those found in CORBA for example, but makes use of sockets easier, more robust and almost as effective as raw TCP.
doc	Automated Smart Wick System-Based Microfarm Using Internet of Things EOS This paper presents a study conducted to allow urban farmers to remotely monitor their farm through the design and development of an Internet of Things-based (IoT) microfarm prototype which utilized wick system as planting method. EOS The system involves the detection of three environmental parameters namely, light intensity, soil moisture and temperature through the use of respective sensors which were connected to the Arduino microcontroller, the sensor node of the system. EOS Irregularities in the aforementioned parameters were neutralized through the use of parameter regulators such as LED growlight strips, water pump and air cooler. EOS The data collected by these sensors were gathered by the Arduino microcontroller and were sent to the Web database through the IoT gateway which was the Raspberry Pi computer chip. EOS These data were also sent to an Android unit installed with the Microfarm Companion application which was capable of monitoring and controlling the environmental parameters observed in the microfarm. EOS The application allows the user to view the current value of the parameter involved and to choose whether to control the parameter regulators automatically or manually. EOS The microfarm system runs autonomously which reduces the labor required to produce healthy plants and crops.	Mustard greens samples were used in testing the system.
doc	Black widow evolution: magnetic braking by an ablated wind EOS Black widows are close binary systems in which a millisecond pulsar is orbited by a companion a few per cent the mass of the sun. EOS It has been suggested that the pulsar's rotationally powered _EQN_ -ray luminosity gradually evaporates the companion, eventually leaving behind an isolated millisecond pulsar. EOS The evaporation efficiency is determined by the temperature _EQN_ to which the outflow is heated by the flux _EQN_ on a dynamical time-scale. EOS Evaporation is most efficient for companions that fill their Roche lobes. EOS In this case, the outflow is dominated by a cap around the L1 point with an angle _EQN_, and the evaporation time is _EQN_, where _EQN_ is the companion's virial temperature.	We apply our model to the observed black widow population, which has increased substantially over the last decade, considering each system's orbital period, companion mass, and pulsar spin-down power.

doc	3D numerical simulations of photodissociated and photoionized disks EOS In this work we study the influence of the UV radiation field of a massive star on the evolution of a disklike mass of gas and dust around a nearby star. EOS This system has similarities with the Orion proplyds. EOS We study disks with different inclinations and distances from the source, performing 3D numerical simulations. EOS We use the YGUAZ\'U-A adaptative grid code modified to account for EUV/FUV fluxes and non-spherical mass distributions. EOS We treat H and C photoionization to reproduce the ionization fronts and photodissociation regions observed in proplyds. EOS We also incorporate a wind from the ionizing source, to investigate the formation of the bow shock observed in several proplyds. EOS Our results show that a photoevaporated wind propagates from the disk surface and becomes ionized after an ionization front (IF) seen as a bright peak in Ha maps. EOS We follow the development of an HI region inside the photoevaporated wind which corresponds to a photodissociated region (PDR) for most of our models, except those without a FUV flux. EOS For disks that are at a distance from the source d \geq 0.1 pc, the PDR is thick and the IF is detached from the disk surface.	In contrast, for disks that are closer to the source, the PDR is thin and not resolved in our simulations.
doc	Interval structures in the Bruhat and weak orders EOS We study the appearance of notable interval structures---lattices, modular lattices, distributive lattices, and boolean lattices---in both the Bruhat and weak orders of Coxeter groups. EOS We collect and expand upon known results for principal order ideals, including pattern characterizations and enumerations for the symmetric group.	This segues naturally into a similar analysis for arbitrary intervals, although the results are less characterizing for the Bruhat order at this generality.
doc	Transitional Disks as Signposts of Young, Multiplanet Systems EOS Although there has yet been no undisputed discovery of a still-forming planet embedded in a gaseous protoplanetary disk, the cleared inner holes of transitional disks may be signposts of young planets. EOS Here we show that the subset of accreting transitional disks with wide, optically thin inner holes of 15 AU or more can only be sculpted by multiple planets orbiting inside each hole. EOS Multiplanet systems provide two key ingredients for explaining the origins of transitional disks.	First, multiple planets can clear wide inner holes where single planets open only narrow gaps.

EOS The electrical resistivity as well as the Seebeck coefficient shows a clear kink at the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition of tr-Cr _EQN_ Te _EQN_, which is also confirmed by the heat capacity measurement.	The scaling behavior between anomalous Hall resistivity _EQN_ and longitudinal resistivity _EQN_ is linear below _EQN_.
doc	Cycle density in infinite Ramanujan graphs EOS We introduce a technique using nonbacktracking random walk for estimating the spectral radius of simple random walk. EOS This technique relates the density of nontrivial cycles in simple random walk to that in nonbacktracking random walk. EOS We apply this to infinite Ramanujan graphs, which are regular graphs whose spectral radius equals that of the tree of the same degree. EOS Kesten showed that the only infinite Ramanujan graphs that are Cayley graphs are trees. EOS This result was extended to unimodular random rooted regular graphs by Ab\' e rt, Glasner and Vir\' a g. EOS We show that an analogous result holds for all regular graphs: the frequency of times spent by simple random walk in a nontrivial cycle is a.s. EOS 0 on every infinite Ramanujan graph.	We also give quantitative versions of that result, which we apply to answer another question of Ab\' e rt, Glasner and Vir\' a g, showing that on an infinite Ramanujan graph, the probability that simple random walk encounters a short cycle tends to 0 a.s.
doc	Analysis of Hyper-Parameters for Small Games: Iterations or Epochs in Self-Play? EOS The landmark achievements of AlphaGo Zero have created great research interest into self-play in reinforcement learning. EOS In self-play, Monte Carlo Tree Search is used to train a deep neural network, that is then used in tree searches. EOS Training itself is governed by many hyperparameters.There has been surprisingly little research on design choices for hyper-parameter values and loss-functions, presumably because of the prohibitive computational cost to explore the parameter space. EOS In this paper, we investigate 12 hyper-parameters in an AlphaZero-like self-play algorithm and evaluate how these parameters contribute to training. EOS We use small games, to achieve meaningful exploration with moderate computational effort. EOS The experimental results show that training is highly sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. EOS Through multi-objective analysis we identify 4 important hyper-parameters to further assess. EOS To start, we find surprising results where too much training can sometimes lead to lower performance. EOS Our main result is that the number of self-play iterations subsumes MCTS-search simulations, game-episodes, and training epochs. EOS The intuition is that these three increase together as self-play iterations increase, and that increasing them individually is sub-optimal. EOS A consequence of our experiments is a direct recommendation for setting hyper-parameter values in self-play: the overarching outer-loop of self-play iterations should be maximized, in favor of the three inner-loop hyper-parameters, which should be set at lower values.	A secondary result of our experiments concerns the choice of optimization goals, for which we also provide recommendations.
doc	Interleaved Weighted Round-Robin: A Network Calculus Analysis EOS Weighted Round-Robin (WRR) is often used, due to its simplicity, for scheduling packets or tasks. EOS With WRR, a number of packets equal to the weight allocated to a flow can be served consecutively, which leads to a bursty service. EOS Interleaved Weighted Round-Robin (IWRR) is a variant that mitigates this effect. EOS We are interested in finding bounds on worst-case delay obtained with IWRR.	To this end, we use a network calculus approach and find a strict service curve for IWRR.

doc	The mass distribution in the innermost regions of Spiral Galaxies EOS We use high-spatial resolution (_EQN_) rotation curves of 83 spiral galaxies to investigate the mass distribution of their innermost kpc. EOS We show that, in this region, the luminous matter completely accounts for the gravitational potential and no dark component is required.	The derived I-band disk mass-to-light ratios agree well with those obtained from population synthesis models and correlate with color in a similar way.
doc	Dimension formula of the affine Deligne-Lusztig variety _EQN_ EOS The study of certain union _EQN_ of affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties in the affine flag varieties arose from the study of Shimura varieties with Iwahori level structure.

doc	Rule Module Inheritance with Modification Restrictions EOS Adapting rule sets to different settings, yet avoiding uncontrolled proliferation of variations, is a key challenge of rule management. EOS One fundamental concept to foster reuse and simplify adaptation is inheritance. EOS Building on rule modules, i.e., rule sets with input and output schema, we formally define inheritance of rule modules by incremental modification in single inheritance hierarchies.	To avoid uncontrolled proliferation of modifications, we introduce formal modification restrictions which flexibly regulate the degree to which a child module may be modified in comparison to its parent.

doc	The _EQN_ Vertex in QCD Sum Rules EOS The _EQN_ form factor is evaluated in a QCD sum rule calculation for both _EQN_ and _EQN_ off-shell mesons. EOS We study the double Borel sum rule for the three point function of two pseudoscalar and one vector meson current.	We find that the momentum dependence of the form factors is different if the _EQN_ or the _EQN_ meson is off-shell, but they lead to the same coupling constant in the _EQN_ vertex.
doc	Aharonov-Bohm scattering of charged particles and neutral atoms: the role of absorption EOS The Aharonov-Bohm scattering of charged particles by the magnetic field of an infinitely long and infinitely thin solenoid (magnetic string) in an absorbing medium is studied. EOS We discuss the partial-wave approach to this problem and show that standard partial-wave method can be adjusted to this case. EOS The effect of absorption leads to oscillations of the AB cross section. EOS Based on this we investigate the scattering of neutral atoms with induced electric dipole moments by a charge wire of finite radius which is placed in an uniform magnetic field. EOS The physical realistic and practically important case that all atoms which collide with the wire are totally absorbed at its surface, is studied in detail. EOS The dominating terms of the scattering amplitude are evaluated analytically for different physical constellations.	The rest terms are written in a form suitable for a numerical computation.
doc	Effect of cell residence time variance on the performance of an advanced paging algorithm EOS The use of advanced sequential paging algorithms has been suggested as a means to reduce the signaling cost in future mobile cellular networks. EOS In a proposed algorithm (Koukoutsidis and Theologou, 2003), the system can use the additional information of the last interaction cell combined with a mobility model to predict the short-term location probabilities at the time of an incoming call arrival. EOS The short-term location probabilities reduce the uncertainty in mobile user position and thus greatly improve the search. EOS In this paper, an analytical model is derived that allows for a general distribution of cell residence times.	By considering a Gamma distribution, we study the effect of the variance of cell residence times and derive useful results on the performance of the algorithm.
doc	Towards Deep Neural Network Architectures Robust to Adversarial Examples EOS Recent work has shown deep neural networks (DNNs) to be highly susceptible to well-designed, small perturbations at the input layer, or so-called adversarial examples.

doc	Transport properties of ultrathin YBa _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ O _EQN_ nanowires: a route to single photon detection EOS We report on the growth and characterization of ultrathin YBa _EQN_ Cu _EQN_ O _EQN_ (YBCO) films on MgO (110) substrates, which exhibit superconducting properties at thicknesses down to 3 nm. EOS YBCO nanowires, with thicknesses down to 10 nm and widths down to 65 nm, have been also successfully fabricated. EOS The nanowires protected by a Au capping layer show superconducting properties close to the as-grown films, and critical current densities, which are only limited by vortex dynamics. EOS The 10 nm thick YBCO nanowires without the Au capping present hysteretic current voltage characteristics, characterized by a voltage switch which drives the nanowires directly from the superconducting to the normal state. EOS Such bistability is associated in NbN nanowires to the presence of localized normal domains within the superconductor.	The presence of the voltage switch, in ultrathin nanostructures characterized by high sheet resistance values, though preserving high quality superconducting properties, make our nanowires very attractive devices to engineer single photon detectors.
doc	Measurement of _EQN_ via Initial State Radiation at Belle EOS We report measurement of the cross section of _EQN_ between 4.0 and _EQN_, based on an analysis of initial state radiation events in a _EQN_ data sample recorded with the Belle detector. EOS The properties of the _EQN_ and _EQN_ states are determined. EOS Fitting the mass spectrum of _EQN_ with two coherent Breit-Wigner functions, we find two solutions with identical mass and width but different couplings to electron-positron pairs: _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_, _EQN_ ; EOS and _EQN_ and _EQN_ for one solution;	or _EQN_ and _EQN_ for the other.
doc	The secrets of T Pyx: I. UV observations EOS We have studied the UV spectral behavior of the recurrent nova T Pyx during 16 years of IUE observations. EOS We examined both the IUE line-by-line images and the extracted spectra in order to understand the reality and the origin of the observed spectral variations.	The UV continuum of T Pyx has remained nearly constant in slope and intensity over this time interval, without any indication of long-term trends.
doc	Anderson localization of a Rydberg electron along a classical orbit EOS Anderson localization is related to exponential localization of a particle in the configuration space in the presence of a disorder potential. EOS Anderson localization can be also observed in the momentum space and corresponds to quantum suppression of classical diffusion in systems that are classically chaotic. EOS Another kind of Anderson localization has been recently proposed, i.e. EOS localization in the time domain due to the presence of disorder in time.	That is, the probability density for the detection of a system at a fixed position in the configuration space is localized exponentially around a certain moment of time if a system is driven by a force that fluctuates in time.
doc	First passage times of two-correlated processes: analytical results for the Wiener process and a numerical method for diffusion processes EOS Given a two-dimensional correlated diffusion process, we determine the joint density of the first passage times of the process to some constant boundaries.	This quantity depends on the joint density of the first passage time of the first crossing component and of the position of the second crossing component before its crossing time.
doc	Predicting the Properties of the Remnants of Dissipative Galaxy Mergers EOS We construct a physically motivated model for predicting the properties of the remnants of gaseous galaxy mergers, given the properties of the progenitors and the orbit. EOS The model is calibrated using a large suite of SPH merger simulations. EOS It implements generalized energy conservation while accounting for dissipative energy losses and star formation.	The dissipative effects are evaluated from the initial gas fractions and from the orbital parameters via an "impulse" parameter, which characterizes the strength of the encounter.
doc	Spin and Charge Dynamics in a Renormalised Perturbation Theory EOS We calculate the spin and charge dynamical susceptibilities of a strongly correlated impurity model in a renormalised perturbation theory. EOS The irreducible for vertices for the quasiparticle scattering are deduced from the renormalised parameters, which have been calculated by fitting of the low-lying levels of a numerical renormalisation group (NRG) calculation to those of an effective Anderson model.	The susceptibilities are asymptotically exact in the low frequency limit and satisfy the Korringa-Shiba relation.
doc	Combined effects of Sr substitution and pressure on the ground states in CaFe _EQN_ As _EQN_ EOS We present a detailed study of the combined effects of Sr substitution and hydrostatic pressure on the ground-state properties of CaFe _EQN_ As _EQN_. EOS Measurements of the electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility, both at ambient and finite pressure _EQN_ _EQN_ 2 _EQN_ GPa, were performed on Ca _EQN_ Sr _EQN_ Fe _EQN_ As _EQN_ single crystals grown out of Sn flux. EOS We find that upon Sr substitution the ranges of stability of both the structural-magnetic transition and the transition into the non-magnetic collapsed tetragonal phase are shifted to higher pressure levels with the latter moving at a higher rate. EOS This suggests the possibility of separating the two phase lines, which intersect already at elevated temperatures for _EQN_ = 0 and low Sr concentration levels. EOS For _EQN_ = 0.177 we find strong evidence that both phases remain separated down to lowest temperature and that a zero-resistance state emerges in this intermediate pressure window.	This observation indicates that Sr-substitution combined with hydrostatic pressure provides another route for stabilizing superconductivity in CaFe _EQN_ As _EQN_.
doc	The pulsar force-free magnetosphere linked to its striped wind: time-dependent pseudo-spectral simulations EOS (abridged) Pulsar activity and its related radiation mechanism are usually explained by invoking some plasma processes occurring inside the magnetosphere. EOS Despite many detailed local investigations, the global electrodynamics around those neutron stars remains poorly described. EOS Better understanding of these compact objects requires a deep and accurate knowledge of their immediate electromagnetic surrounding within the magnetosphere and its link to the relativistic pulsar wind. EOS The aim of this work is to present accurate solutions to the nearly stationary force-free pulsar magnetosphere and its link to the striped wind, for various spin periods and arbitrary inclination. EOS To this end, the time-dependent Maxwell equations are solved in spherical geometry in the force-free approximation using a vector spherical harmonic expansion of the electromagnetic field. EOS An exact analytical enforcement of the divergenceless of the magnetic part is obtained by a projection method. EOS Special care has been given to design an algorithm able to look deeply into the magnetosphere with physically realistic ratios of stellar _EQN_ to light-cylinder _EQN_ radius. EOS We checked our code against several analytical solutions, like the Deutsch vacuum rotator solution and the Michel monopole field. EOS We also retrieve energy losses comparable to the magneto-dipole radiation formula and consistent with previous similar works. EOS Finally, for arbitrary obliquity, we give an expression for the total electric charge of the system. EOS It does not vanish except for the perpendicular rotator.	This is due to the often ignored point charge located at the centre of the neutron star.

doc	Magnetism and effect of anisotropy with one dimensional monatomic chain of cobalt by a Monte Carlo simulation EOS The magnetic properties of the one dimensional (1D) monatomic chain of Co reported in a previous experimental work are investigated by a classical Monte Carlo simulation based on the anisotropic Heisenberg model. EOS In our simulation, the effect of the on-site uniaxial anisotropy, Ku, on each individual Co atom and the nearest neighbour exchange interaction, J, are accounted for. EOS The normalized coercivity HC(T)/HC(TCL) is found to show a universal behaviour, HC(T)/HC(TCL) = h0(e^ TB/T -e) in the temperature interval, TCL < T < TBCal, arising from the thermal activation effect.	In the above expression, h0 is a constant, TBCal is the blocking temperature determined by the calculation, and TCL is the temperature above which the classical Monte Carlo simulation gives a good description on the investigated system.
doc	The Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating Conjecture. I EOS By analogy with conjectures for random matrices, Fyodorov-Hiary-Keating and Fyodorov-Keating proposed precise asymptotics for the maximum of the Riemann zeta function in a typical short interval on the critical line.	In this paper, we settle the upper bound part of their conjecture in a strong form.
doc	Single fermion manipulation via superconducting phase differences in multiterminal Josephson junctions EOS We show how the superconducting phase difference in a Josephson junction may be used to split the Kramers degeneracy of its energy levels and to remove all the properties associated with time reversal symmetry. EOS The superconducting phase difference is known to be ineffective in two-terminal short Josephson junctions, where irrespective of the junction structure the induced Kramers degeneracy splitting is suppressed and the ground state fermion parity must stay even, so that a protected zero-energy Andreev level crossing may never appear. EOS Our main result is that these limitations can be completely avoided by using multi-terminal Josephson junctions. EOS There the Kramers degeneracy breaking becomes comparable to the superconducting gap, and applying phase differences may cause the change of the ground state fermion parity from even to odd.	We prove that the necessary condition for the appearance of a fermion parity switch is the presence of a "discrete vortex" in the junction: the situation when the phases of the superconducting leads wind by _EQN_.
doc	Computing the Absolute Gibbs Free Energy in Atomistic Simulations: Applications to Defects in Solids EOS The Gibbs free energy is the fundamental thermodynamic potential underlying the relative stability of different states of matter under constant-pressure conditions. EOS However, computing this quantity from atomic-scale simulations is far from trivial.	As a consequence, all too often the potential energy of the system is used as a proxy, overlooking entropic and anharmonic effects.
doc	Sharp Cheeger-Buser type inequalities in _EQN_ spaces EOS The goal of the paper is to sharpen and generalise bounds involving the Cheeger's isoperimetric constant _EQN_ and the first eigenvalue _EQN_ of the Laplacian.

doc	Monitoring of dynamical phase-space trajectories with sub-Heisenberg indeterminacy EOS The Heisenberg uncertainty relation describes the fact that the phase-space trajectory of a single quantum system cannot be precisely determined with respect to semi-classical reference values to better than twice the quantum system's ground state uncertainty. EOS Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen pointed out that according to quantum theory, however, there are pairs of quantum systems whose properties with respect to each other can be arbitrarily precisely determined. EOS Here we report the experimental proof that even the dynamics of a quantum system, i.e.	its phase-space trajectory, can be precisely determined with respect to another quantum system.
doc	Influence of Non-Potential Coronal Magnetic Topology on Solar-Wind Models EOS By comparing a magneto-frictional model of the low coronal magnetic field to a potential-field source-surface model, we investigate the possible impact of non-potential magnetic structure on empirical solar-wind models. EOS These empirical models (such as Wang-Sheeley-Arge) estimate the distribution of solar-wind speed solely from the magnetic-field structure in the low corona. EOS Our models are computed in a domain between the solar surface and 2.5 solar radii, and are extended to 0.1 AU using a Schatten current-sheet model.	The non-potential field has a more complex magnetic skeleton and quasi-separatrix structures than the potential field, leading to different sub-structure in the solar-wind speed proxies.
doc	Spin-resolved electronic response to the phase transition in MoTe _EQN_ EOS The semimetal MoTe _EQN_ is studied by spin- and angle- resolved photoemission spectroscopy to probe the detailed electronic structure underlying its broad range of response behavior. EOS A novel spin-texture is uncovered in the bulk Fermi surface of the non-centrosymmetric structural phase that is consistent with first-principles calculations.	The spin-texture is three-dimensional, both in terms of momentum dependence and spin-orientation, and is not completely suppressed above the centrosymmetry-breaking transition temperature.

doc	Robust Classification with Sparse Representation Fusion on Diverse Data Subsets EOS Sparse Representation (SR) techniques encode the test samples into a sparse linear combination of all training samples and then classify the test samples into the class with the minimum residual. EOS The classification of SR techniques depends on the representation capability on the test samples. EOS However, most of these models view the representation problem of the test samples as a deterministic problem, ignoring the uncertainty of the representation. EOS The uncertainty is caused by two factors, random noise in the samples and the intrinsic randomness of the sample set, which means that if we capture a group of samples, the obtained set of samples will be different in different conditions. EOS In this paper, we propose a novel method based upon Collaborative Representation that is a special instance of SR and has closed-form solution. EOS It performs Sparse Representation Fusion based on the Diverse Subset of training samples (SRFDS), which reduces the impact of randomness of the sample set and enhances the robustness of classification results. EOS The proposed method is suitable for multiple types of data and has no requirement on the pattern type of the tasks. EOS In addition, SRFDS not only preserves a closed-form solution but also greatly improves the classification performance.	Promising results on various datasets serve as the evidence of better performance of SRFDS than other SR-based methods.
doc	Jamming transition with fluctuations of characteristic acceleration/braking time within Lorentz model EOS Jamming transition in traffic flow (between free and jammed traffic) for homogeneous car following model has been investigated taking into account fluctuations of characteristic acceleration/braking time. EOS These fluctuations are defined by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. EOS The behaviour of the most probable deviation of headway from its optimal value has been studied and phase diagram of the system has been calculated for supercritical and subcritical regimes of jam formation. EOS It has been found that for the first regime the fluctuations of characteristic acceleration/braking time result in coexistence of free moving and jammed traffic, that is typical for the first-order phase transition, and in appearance of two steady states for the second mode. EOS These states correspond to non-zero values of headway deviation at which the formation of jam and congested traffic are possible.	Using phase-plain portraits method the kinetics of the system transitions has been analyzed for different domains of the phase diagram for both regimes.
doc	Cosmic Solenoids: Minimal Cross-Section and Generalized Flux Quantization EOS A self-consistent general relativistic configuration describing a finite cross-section magnetic flux tube is constructed. EOS The cosmic solenoid is modeled by an elastic superconductive surface which separates the Melvin core from the surrounding flat conic structure. EOS We show that a given amount _EQN_ of magnetic flux cannot be confined within a cosmic solenoid of circumferential radius smaller than _EQN_ without creating a conic singularity. EOS Gauss-Codazzi matching conditions are derived by means of a self-consistent action. EOS The source term, representing the surface currents, is sandwiched between internal and external gravitational surface terms. EOS Surface superconductivity is realized by means of a Higgs scalar minimally coupled to projective electromagnetism.	Trading the 'magnetic' London phase for a dual 'electric' surface vector potential, the generalized quantization condition reads: _EQN_ with _EQN_ denoting some dual 'electric' charge, thereby allowing for a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect.
doc	The Herschel/HIFI spectral survey of OMC-2 FIR 4 (CHESS): An overview of the 480 to 1902 GHz range EOS Broadband spectral surveys of protostars offer a rich view of the physical, chemical and dynamical structure and evolution of star-forming regions. EOS The Herschel Space Observatory opened up the terahertz regime to such surveys, giving access to the fundamental transitions of many hydrides and to the high-energy transitions of many other species. EOS A comparative analysis of the chemical inventories and physical processes and properties of protostars of various masses and evolutionary states is the goal of the Herschel CHEmical Surveys of Star forming regions (CHESS) key program. EOS This paper focusses on the intermediate-mass protostar, OMC-2 FIR 4. EOS We obtained a spectrum of OMC-2 FIR 4 in the 480 to 1902 GHz range with the HIFI spectrometer onboard Herschel and carried out the reduction, line identification, and a broad analysis of the line profile components, excitation, and cooling. EOS We detect 719 spectral lines from 40 species and isotopologs. EOS The line flux is dominated by CO, H2O, and CH3OH. EOS The line profiles are complex and vary with species and upper level energy, but clearly contain signatures from quiescent gas, a broad component likely due to an outflow, and a foreground cloud.	We find abundant evidence for warm, dense gas, as well as for an outflow in the field of view.
doc	Ultrafast Dynamics of Interfacial Electric Fields in Semiconductor Heterostructures Monitored by Pump-Probe Second Harmonic Generation EOS We report first measurements of the ultrafast dynamics of interfacial electric fields in semiconductor multilayers using pump-probe second harmonic generation (SHG). EOS A pump beam was tuned to excite carriers in all layers of GaAs/GaSb and GaAs/GaSb/InAs heterostructures. EOS Further carrier dynamics manifests itself via electric fields created by by charge separation at interfaces. EOS The evolution of interfacial fields is monitored by a probe beam through the eletric-field-induced SHG signal. EOS We distinguish between several stages of dynamics originating from redistribution of carriers between the layers.	We also find a strong enhancement of the induced electric field caused by hybridization of the conduction and valence bands at the GaSb/InAs interface.

This value is significantly higher than in other star forming regions of the SMC.

doc	Collapse. What else? EOS We present the quantum measurement problem as a serious physics problem. EOS Serious because without a resolution, quantum theory is not complete, as it does not tell how one should - in principle - perform measurements. EOS It is physical in the sense that the solution will bring new physics, i.e.	new testable predictions, hence it is not merely a matter of interpretation of a frozen formalism.
doc	Measures of Correlation for Multiple Variables EOS Multivariate correlation analysis plays an important role in various fields such as statistics, economics, and big data analytics. EOS In this paper, we propose a pair of measures, the unsigned correlation coefficient (UCC) and the unsigned incorrelation coefficient (UIC), to measure the strength of correlation and incorrelation (lack of correlation) among multiple variables. EOS The absolute value of Pearson's correlation coefficient is a special case of UCC for two variables.	Some important properties of UCC and UIC show that the proposed UCC and UIC are a pair of effective measures for multivariate correlation.
doc	Frenkel electron on an arbitrary electromagnetic background and magnetic Zitterbewegung EOS We present Lagrangian which implies both necessary constraints and dynamical equations for position and spin of relativistic spin one-half particle. EOS The model is consistent for any value of magnetic moment _EQN_ and for arbitrary electromagnetic background. EOS Our equations coincide with those of Frenkel in the approximation in which the latter have been obtained by Frenkel. EOS Transition from approximate to exact equations yields two structural modifications of the theory. EOS First, Frenkel condition on spin-tensor turns into the Pirani condition. EOS Second, canonical momentum is no more proportional to velocity.	Due to this, even when _EQN_ (Frenkel case), the complete and approximate equations predict different behavior of particle.

doc	The Nature of Angular Momentum Transport in Radiative Self-Gravitating Protostellar Discs EOS Semi-analytic models of self-gravitating discs often approximate the angular momentum transport generated by the gravitational instability using the phenomenology of viscosity. EOS This allows the employment of the standard viscous evolution equations, and gives promising results. EOS It is, however, still not clear when such an approximation is appropriate. EOS This paper tests this approximation using high resolution 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of self-gravitating protostellar discs with radiative transfer. EOS The nature of angular momentum transport associated with the gravitational instability is characterised as a function of both the stellar mass and the disc-to-star mass ratio. EOS The effective viscosity is calculated from the Reynolds and gravitational stresses in the disc.	This is then compared to what would be expected if the effective viscosity were determined by assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium or, equivalently, that the local dissipation rate matches the local cooling rate.

EOS Mat. EOS Exp., 7, 4316 (2017)] for all-optical control of the macroscopic spin orientation in nanostructures in fs time scales. EOS This requires strong spin-photon coupling for the resonant enhancement of opto-magnetic fields, generated through the inverse Faraday effect, in magnetic nanostructures with perpendicular anisotropy.	Here we report on the development of nm thick interlayers to control the growth orientation of hcp-Co alloys grown on refractory plasmonic materials to align the magnetic axis out-of-plane, thereby meeting key requirements for the realization of ultrafast magneto-photonic devices.
doc	Strange Particle Production in p+p, p+Pb and Pb+Pb Interactions from NA49 EOS Recent NA49 results on Lambda, Antilambda, Xi- and Antixi+ production in minimum bias p+p and centrality selected p+Pb collisions at 158 GeV/c, and the results on Lambda, Antilambda, K+ and K- production in central Pb+Pb collisions at 40, 80 and 158 A GeV are discussed and compared with other available data. EOS By comparing the energy dependence of Lambda and Antilambda production at mid-rapidity a striking similarity is observed between p+p and A+A data. EOS This is also seen in the energy dependence of the Lambda/pi ratio. EOS K+/pi at mid-rapidity is affected in a similar way, due to the associated production of K+ together with Lambda particles. EOS The observed yields increase faster than the number of wounded nucleons when comparing p+Pb to p+p.	As already observed in A+A collisions, the increase is larger for multistrange than for strange baryons and for baryons than for anti-baryons.

doc	Void Filling of Digital Elevation Models with Deep Generative Models EOS In recent years, advances in machine learning algorithms, cheap computational resources, and the availability of big data have spurred the deep learning revolution in various application domains. EOS In particular, supervised learning techniques in image analysis have led to superhuman performance in various tasks, such as classification, localization, and segmentation, while unsupervised learning techniques based on increasingly advanced generative models have been applied to generate high-resolution synthetic images indistinguishable from real images.	In this paper we consider a state-of-the-art machine learning model for image inpainting, namely a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network based on a fully convolutional architecture with a contextual attention mechanism.

The Hall mobility of Ba0.98La0.02SnO3 crystals with the n-type carrier concentration of \sim 8-10\times10 19 cm-3 is found to be \sim 103 cm2 V-1s-1 at room temperature, and the precise measurement of the band gap \Delta of a BaSnO3 crystal shows \Delta=4.05 eV, which is significantly larger than those of other transparent conductive oxides.
doc	Organ size increases with obesity and correlates with cancer risk EOS Obesity increases significantly cancer risk in various organs. EOS Although this has been recognized for decades, the mechanism through which this happens has never been explained. EOS Here, we show that the volumes of kidneys, pancreas, and liver are strongly correlated (median correlation = 0.625; EOS P-value<10-47) with the body mass index (BMI) of an individual. EOS We also find a significant relationship between the increase in organ volume and the increase in cancer risk (P-value<10-12).	These results provide a mechanism explaining why obese individuals have higher cancer risk in several organs: the larger the organ volume the more cells at risk of becoming cancerous.
doc	Shocks in Vertically Oscillated Granular Layers EOS We study shock formation in vertically oscillated granular layers, using both molecular dynamics simulations and numerical solutions of continuum equations to Navier-Stokes order. EOS A flat layer of grains is thrown up from an oscillating plate during each oscillation cycle and collides with the plate later in the cycle. EOS The collisions produce layer compaction near the plate and a high temperature shock front that rapidly propagates upward through the layer. EOS The shock is highly time-dependent, propagating through the layer in only a quarter of the cycle.	We compare numerical solutions of the continuum equations to molecular dynamics simulations that assume binary, instantaneous collisions between frictionless hard spheres.
doc	Polynomial approximations in a generalized Nyman-Beurling criterion EOS The Nyman-Beurling criterion, equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis, is an approximation problem in the space of square integrable functions on _EQN_, involving dilations of the fractional part function by factors _EQN_, _EQN_. EOS Randomizing the _EQN_ generates new structures and criteria. EOS One of them is a sufficient condition that splits into (i) showing that the indicator function can be approximated by convolution with the fractional part, (ii) a control on the coefficients of the approximation.	This self-contained paper aims at identifying functions for which (i) holds unconditionally, by means of polynomial approximations.
doc	Efficient Photonic Crystal Cavity-Waveguide Couplers EOS Coupling of photonic crystal (PC) linear three-hole defect cavities (L3) to PC waveguides is theoretically and experimentally investigated. EOS The systems are designed to increase the overlap between the evanescent cavity field and the waveguide mode, and to operate in the linear dispersion region of the waveguide. EOS Our simulations indicate increased coupling when the cavity is tilted by 60 degrees with respect to the waveguide axis, which we have also confirmed by experiments.	We obtained up to 90% coupling efficiency into the waveguide.

doc	Cosmology with the CMB temperature-polarization correlation EOS We demonstrate that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature-polarization cross-correlation provides accurate and robust constraints on cosmological parameters. EOS We compare them with the results from temperature or polarization and investigate the impact of foregrounds, cosmic variance, and instrumental noise. EOS This analysis makes use of the Planck high-multipole HiLLiPOP likelihood based on angular power spectra, which takes into account systematics from the instrument and foreground residuals directly modelled using Planck measurements. EOS The temperature-polarization correlation (TE) spectrum is less contaminated by astrophysical emissions than the temperature power spectrum (TT), allowing constraints that are less sensitive to foreground uncertainties to be derived. EOS For \Lambda CDM parameters, TE gives very competitive results compared to TT.	For basic \Lambda CDM model extensions (such as AL, \Sigma m \nu, or Neff), it is still limited by the instrumental noise level in the polarization maps.

doc	A systematic observational study on Galactic interstellar ratio 18O/17O: I. C18O and C17O J=1-0 data analysis EOS The interstellar oxygen isotopic ratio of 18O/17O can reflect the relative amount of the secular enrichment by ejecta from high-mass versus intermediate-mass stars. EOS Previous observations found a Galactic gradient of 18O/17O, i.e., low ratios in the Galactic center and large values in the Galactic disk, which supports the insideout formation scenario of our Galaxy. EOS However, the observed objects are not many and, in particular, not so many at large galactocentric distances.	Thus we started a systematic study on Galactic interstellar 18O/17O, through observations of C18O and C17O multi-transition lines toward a large sample of 286 sources (at least one order of magnitude larger than previous ones), from the Galactic center region to the far outer Galaxy (~22 kpc).
doc	Hereditary Automorphic Lie Algebras EOS We show that Automorphic Lie Algebras which contain a Cartan subalgebra with a constant spectrum, called hereditary, are completely described by 2-cocycles on a classical root system taking only two different values. EOS This observation suggests a novel approach to their classification. EOS By determining the values of the cocycles on opposite roots, we obtain the Killing form and the abelianisation of the Automorphic Lie Algebra. EOS The results are obtained by studying equivariant vectors on the projective line.	As a byproduct, we describe a method to reduce the computation of the infinite dimensional space of said equivariant vectors to a finite dimensional linear computation and the determination of the ring of automorphic functions on the projective line.

doc	Smoothed Combined Field Integral Equations for Exterior Helmholtz Problems EOS This paper presents smoothed combined field integral equations for the solution of Dirichlet and Neumann exterior Helmholtz problems. EOS The integral equations introduced in this paper are smooth in the sense that they only involve continuously differentiable integrands in both Dirichlet and Neumann cases. EOS These integral equations coincide with the well-known combined field equations and are therefore uniquely solvable for all frequencies. EOS In particular, a novel regularization of the hypersingular operator is obtained, which, unlike regularizations based on Maue's integration-by-parts formula, does not give rise to involved Cauchy principal value integrals.	The smoothed integral operators and layer potentials, on the other hand, can be numerically evaluated at target points that are arbitrarily close to the boundary without severely compromising their accuracy.

doc	A convergent Lagrangian discretization for _EQN_ -Wasserstein and flux-limited diffusion equations EOS We study a Lagrangian numerical scheme for solution of a nonlinear drift diffusion equation of the form _EQN_ on an interval. EOS This scheme will consist of a spatio-temporal discretization founded in the formulation of the equation in terms of inverse distribution functions. EOS It is based on the gradient flow structure of the equation with respect to optimal transport distances for a family of costs that are in some sense _EQN_ -Wasserstein like. EOS Additionally we will show that, under a regularity assumption on the initial data, this also includes a family of discontinuous, flux-limiting cost. EOS We show that this discretization inherits various properties from the continuous flow, like entropy monotonicity, mass preservation, a minimum/maximum principle and flux-limitation in the case of the corresponding cost. EOS Convergence in the limit of vanishing mesh size will be proven as the main result.	Finally we will present numerical experiments including a numerical convergence analysis.
doc	Fix Your Features: Stationary and Maximally Discriminative Embeddings using Regular Polytope (Fixed Classifier) Networks EOS Neural networks are widely used as a model for classification in a large variety of tasks. EOS Typically, a learnable transformation (i.e. EOS the classifier) is placed at the end of such models returning a value for each class used for classification. EOS This transformation plays an important role in determining how the generated features change during the learning process. EOS In this work we argue that this transformation not only can be fixed (i.e. EOS set as non trainable) with no loss of accuracy, but it can also be used to learn stationary and maximally discriminative embeddings. EOS We show that the stationarity of the embedding and its maximal discriminative representation can be theoretically justified by setting the weights of the fixed classifier to values taken from the coordinate vertices of three regular polytopes available in _EQN_, namely: the _EQN_ -Simplex, the _EQN_ -Cube and the _EQN_ -Orthoplex. EOS These regular polytopes have the maximal amount of symmetry that can be exploited to generate stationary features angularly centered around their corresponding fixed weights.	Our approach improves and broadens the concept of a fixed classifier, recently proposed in REF, to a larger class of fixed classifier models.

doc	Robust Reconstruction of Complex Networks from Sparse Data EOS Reconstructing complex networks from measurable data is a fundamental problem for understanding and controlling collective dynamics of complex networked systems. EOS However, a significant challenge arises when we attempt to decode structural information hidden in limited amounts of data accompanied by noise and in the presence of inaccessible nodes.	Here, we develop a general framework for robust reconstruction of complex networks from sparse and noisy data.
doc	Numerical analysis of lognormal diffusions on the sphere EOS Numerical solutions of stationary diffusion equations on the unit sphere with isotropic lognormal diffusion coefficients are considered. EOS H\"older regularity in _EQN_ sense for isotropic Gaussian random fields is obtained and related to the regularity of the driving lognormal coefficients. EOS This yields regularity in _EQN_ sense of the solution to the diffusion problem in Sobolev spaces. EOS Convergence rate estimates of multilevel Monte Carlo Finite and Spectral Element discretizations of these problems are then deduced.	Specifically, a convergence analysis is provided with convergence rate estimates in terms of the number of Monte Carlo samples of the solution to the considered diffusion equation and in terms of the total number of degrees of freedom of the spatial discretization, and with bounds for the total work required by the algorithm in the case of Finite Element discretizations.

doc	Concentration of risk measures: A Wasserstein distance approach EOS Known finite-sample concentration bounds for the Wasserstein distance between the empirical and true distribution of a random variable are used to derive a two-sided concentration bound for the error between the true conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of a (possibly unbounded) random variable and a standard estimate of its CVaR computed from an i.i.d. EOS sample. EOS The bound applies under fairly general assumptions on the random variable, and improves upon previous bounds which were either one sided, or applied only to bounded random variables. EOS Specializations of the bound to sub-Gaussian and sub-exponential random variables are also derived. EOS Using a different proof technique, the results are extended to the class of spectral risk measures having a bounded risk spectrum. EOS A similar procedure is followed to derive concentration bounds for the error between the true and estimated Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) value of a random variable, in cases where the random variable is bounded or sub-Gaussian.	These bounds are shown to match a known bound in the bounded case, and improve upon the known bound in the sub-Gaussian case.

doc	Improving Recall of In Situ Sequencing by Self-Learned Features and a Graphical Model EOS Image-based sequencing of mRNA makes it possible to see where in a tissue sample a given gene is active, and thus discern large numbers of different cell types in parallel. EOS This is crucial for gaining a better understanding of tissue development and disease such as cancer. EOS Signals are collected over multiple staining and imaging cycles, and signal density together with noise makes signal decoding challenging. EOS Previous approaches have led to low signal recall in efforts to maintain high sensitivity. EOS We propose an approach where signal candidates are generously included, and true-signal probability at the cycle level is self-learned using a convolutional neural network. EOS Signal candidates and probability predictions are thereafter fed into a graphical model searching for signal candidates across sequencing cycles. EOS The graphical model combines intensity, probability and spatial distance to find optimal paths representing decoded signal sequences. EOS We evaluate our approach in relation to state-of-the-art, and show that we increase recall by _EQN_ at maintained sensitivity. EOS Furthermore, visual examination shows that most of the now correctly resolved signals were previously lost due to high signal density.	Thus, the proposed approach has the potential to significantly improve further analysis of spatial statistics in in situ sequencing experiments.

The first one is X_t as t\to\infty, which corresponds to a localization in the case of an initial qubit state.

doc	Quantum-chemical insights from interpretable atomistic neural networks EOS With the rise of deep neural networks for quantum chemistry applications, there is a pressing need for architectures that, beyond delivering accurate predictions of chemical properties, are readily interpretable by researchers. EOS Here, we describe interpretation techniques for atomistic neural networks on the example of Behler-Parrinello networks as well as the end-to-end model SchNet. EOS Both models obtain predictions of chemical properties by aggregating atom-wise contributions. EOS These latent variables can serve as local explanations of a prediction and are obtained during training without additional cost. EOS Due to their correspondence to well-known chemical concepts such as atomic energies and partial charges, these atom-wise explanations enable insights not only about the model but more importantly about the underlying quantum-chemical regularities. EOS We generalize from atomistic explanations to 3d space, thus obtaining spatially resolved visualizations which further improve interpretability.	Finally, we analyze learned embeddings of chemical elements that exhibit a partial ordering that resembles the order of the periodic table.
doc	Neural Random Subspace EOS The random subspace method, known as the pillar of random forests, is good at making precise and robust predictions. EOS However, there is not a straightforward way yet to combine it with deep learning.

In contrast to previous forest methods, NRS enjoys the benefits of end-to-end, data-driven representation learning, as well as pervasive support from deep learning software and hardware platforms, hence achieving faster inference speed and higher accuracy.

EOS In this work, we study the way in which the transition between the regimes _EQN_ and _EQN_ manifests in the thermodynamic limit. EOS It is shown that the height function of the six-vertex model delocalizes with logarithmic variance when _EQN_ while remaining localized when _EQN_. EOS In the latter regime, the extremal translation-invariant Gibbs states of the height function are described.	Qualitative differences between the two regimes are further exhibited for the Gibbs states of the six-vertex model itself.

doc	Molecular dynamics simulations with many-body potentials on multiple GPUs - the implementation, package and performance EOS Molecular dynamics (MD) is an important research tool extensively applied in materials science. EOS Running MD on a graphics processing unit (GPU) is an attractive new approach for accelerating MD simulations. EOS Currently, GPU implementations of MD usually run in a one-host-process-one-GPU (OHPOG) scheme. EOS This scheme may pose a limitation on the system size that an implementation can handle due to the small device memory relative to the host memory. EOS In this paper, we present a one-host-process-multiple-GPU (OHPMG) implementation of MD with embedded-atom-model or semi-empirical tight-binding many-body potentials. EOS Because more device memory is available in an OHPMG process, the system size that can be handled is increased to a few million or more atoms. EOS In comparison with the CPU implementation, in which Newton's third law is applied to improve the computational efficiency, our OHPMG implementation has achieved a 28.9x~86.0x speedup in double precision, depending on the system size, the cut-off ranges and the number of GPUs. EOS The implementation can also handle a group of small boxes in one run by combining the small boxes into a large box.	This approach greatly improves the GPU computing efficiency when a large number of MD simulations for small boxes are needed for statistical purposes.
doc	Variation in GMC Association Properties Across Bars, Spiral Arms, Inter-Arms, and Circumnuclear Region of M100 (NGC 4321) Extracted from ALMA Observations EOS We study the physical properties of giant molecular cloud associations (GMAs) in M100 (NGC 4321) using the ALMA Science Verification feathered (12-m+ACA) data in 12CO (1-0). EOS To examine the environmental dependence of GMA properties, GMAs are classified based on their locations in the various environments as circumnuclear ring (CNR), bar, spiral, and inter-arm GMAs. EOS The CNR GMAs are massive and compact, while the inter-arm GMAs are diffuse with low surface density. EOS GMA mass and size are strongly correlated, as suggested by Larson (1981). EOS However, the diverse power-law index of the relation implies that the GMA properties are not uniform among the environments. EOS The CNR and bar GMAs show higher velocity dispersion than those in other environments. EOS We find little evidence for a correlation between GMA velocity dispersion and size, which indicates that the GMAs are in diverse dynamical states. EOS Indeed, the virial parameter of GMAs spans nearly two orders of magnitude. EOS Only the spiral GMAs are in general self-gravitating. EOS Star formation activity of the GMAs decreases in order over the CNR, spiral, bar, and the inter-arm GMAs. EOS The diverse GMA and star formation properties in different environments lead to variations in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. EOS A combination of multiple mechanisms or gas phase change is necessary to explain the observed slopes. EOS Comparisons of GMA properties acquired with the use of the 12-m-array observations with those from the feathered data are also presented.	The results show that the missing flux and extended emission cannot be neglected for the study of environmental dependence.

EOS Kontsevich and P. EOS Seidel. EOS Combining this with the categorical formulation of cubic string field theory in the presence of D-branes, I consider a collection of topological D-branes wrapped over the same Lagrangian cycle and derive its string field action from first principles. EOS The result is a _EQN_ -graded version of super-Chern-Simons field theory living on the Lagrangian cycle, whose relevant string field is a degree one superconnection in a _EQN_ -graded superbundle, in the sense previously considered in mathematical work of J. EOS M. EOS Bismutt and J. EOS Lott. EOS This gives a refined (and modified) version of a proposal previously made by C. EOS Vafa. EOS I analyze the vacuum deformations of this theory and relate them to topological D-brane composite formation, by using the general formalism developed in a previous paper. EOS This allows me to identify a large class of topological D-brane composites (generalized, or `exotic' topological D-branes) which do not admit a traditional description.	Among these are objects which correspond to the `covariantly constant sequences of flat bundles' considered by Bismut and Lott, as well as more general structures, which are related to the enhanced triangulated categories of Bondal and Kapranov.
doc	On twisted Gelfand pairs through commutativity of a Hecke algebra EOS For a locally compact, totally disconnected group _EQN_, a subgroup _EQN_ and a character _EQN_ we define a Hecke algebra _EQN_ and explore the connection between commutativity of _EQN_ and the _EQN_ -Gelfand property of _EQN_, i.e. EOS the property _EQN_ for every _EQN_, the irreducible representations of _EQN_. EOS We show that the conditions of the Gelfand-Kazhdan criterion imply commutativity of _EQN_, and verify in several simple cases that commutativity of _EQN_ is equivalent to the _EQN_ -Gelfand property of _EQN_.	We then show that if _EQN_ is a connected reductive group over a _EQN_ -adic field _EQN_, and _EQN_ is _EQN_ -spherical, then the cuspidal part of _EQN_ is commutative if and only if _EQN_ satisfies the _EQN_ -Gelfand property with respect to all cuspidal representations _EQN_.

The investigated primal-dual algorithms are fully decomposable, in the sense that the operators are processed individually at each iteration.
doc	Lattice Boltzmann simulations on the role of channel structure for reactive capillary infiltration EOS It is widely recognized that the structure of porous media is of relevance for a variety of mechanical and physical phenomena. EOS The focus of the present work is on capillarity, a pore-scale process occurring at the micron scale. EOS We attempt to characterize the influence of pore shape for capillary infiltration by means of Lattice Boltzmann simulations in 2D with reactive boundaries leading to surface growth and ultimately to pore closure. EOS The systems under investigation consist of single channels with different simplified morphologies: namely, periodic profiles with sinusoidal, step-shaped and zig-zag walls, as well as constrictions and expansions with rectangular, convex and concave steps. EOS This is a useful way to decompose the complexity of typical porous media into basic structures. EOS The simulations show that the minimum radius alone fails to characterize properly the infiltration dynamics. EOS The structure of the channels emerge as the dominant property controlling the process. EOS A factor responsible for this behavior is identified as being the occurrence of pinning of the contact line.	It turns out that the optimal configuration for the pore structure arises from the packing of large particles with round shapes.

doc	The effect of social roles on group behaviour EOS In a recent series of papers, we proposed a mathematical model for the dynamics of a group of interacting pedestrians. EOS The model is based on a non-Newtonian potential, that accounts for the need of pedestrians to keep both their interacting partner and their walking goal in their vision field, and to keep a comfortable distance between them. EOS These two behaviours account respectively for the angular and radial part of the potential from which the force providing the pedestrian acceleration is derived. EOS The angular term is asymmetric, i.e. EOS does not follow the third law of dynamics, with observable effects on group formation and velocity. EOS We successfully compared the predictions of the model with observations of real world pedestrian behaviour. EOS We then studied the effect of crowd density on group dynamics. EOS We verified that the average effect of crowd density may be modelled by adding a harmonic term to the group potential.	The model predictions, which include "phase transitions" in the group configuration, are again confirmed, at least in the observed density range, by a comparison with real world data.
doc	Physics-based Modeling and Scalable Optimization of Large Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces EOS Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have the potential to transform wireless communication channels into smart reconfigurable propagation environments. EOS To realize this new paradigm, the passive IRSs have to be large, especially for communication in far-field scenarios, so that they can compensate for the large end-to-end path-loss, which is caused by the multiplication of the individual path-losses of the transmitter-to-IRS and IRS-to-receiver channels. EOS However, optimizing a large number of sub-wavelength IRS elements imposes a significant challenge for online transmission. EOS To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a physics-based model and a scalable optimization framework for large IRSs. EOS The basic idea is to partition the IRS unit cells into several subsets, referred to as tiles, model the impact of each tile on the wireless channel, and then optimize each tile in two stages, namely an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. EOS For physics-based modeling, we borrow concepts from the radar literature, model each tile as an anomalous reflector, and derive its impact on the wireless channel for a given phase shift by solving the corresponding integral equations for the electric and magnetic vector fields.	In the offline design stage, the IRS unit cells of each tile are jointly designed for the support of different transmission modes, where each transmission mode effectively corresponds to a given configuration of the phase shifts that the unit cells of the tile apply to an impinging electromagnetic wave.

EOS The record for the best stability and accuracy is currently held by optical lattice clocks. EOS This work takes an important step towards realizing the full potential of a many-particle clock with a state-of-the-art stable laser. EOS Our 87Sr optical lattice clock now achieves fractional stability of 2.2e-16 at 1 s. EOS With this improved stability, we perform a new accuracy evaluation of our clock, reducing many systematic uncertainties that limited our previous measurements, such as those in the lattice ac Stark shift, the atoms' thermal environment, and the atomic response to room-temperature BBR.	Our combined measurements have reduced the total uncertainty of the JILA Sr clock to 2.1e-18 in fractional frequency units.
doc	Dynamical Constraints on Mercury's Collisional Origin EOS Of the solar system's four terrestrial planets, the origin of Mercury is perhaps the most mysterious. EOS Modern numerical simulations designed to model the dynamics of terrestrial planet formation systematically fail to replicate Mercury; EOS which possesses just 5% the mass of Earth and the highest orbital eccentricity and inclination among the planets. EOS However, Mercury's large iron-rich core and low volatile inventory stand out among the inner planets, and seem to imply a violent collisional origin. EOS Because most algorithms used for simulating terrestrial accretion do not consider the effects of collisional fragmentation, it has been difficult to test these collisional hypotheses within the larger context of planet formation. EOS Here, we analyze a large suite of terrestrial accretion models that account for the fragmentation of colliding bodies. EOS We find that planets with core mass fractions boosted as a result of repeated hit-and-run collisions are produced in 90% of our simulations.	While many of these planets are similar to Mercury in mass, they rarely lie on Mercury-like orbits.

The main term of the asymptotics contains Ramanujan function _EQN_ for the scaling parameter on the vertical line _EQN_, while the main term of the asymptotics involves the theta functions for the scaling parameter in the strip _EQN_.
doc	Exciting, Cooling And Vortex Trapping In A Bose-Condensed Gas EOS A straight forward numerical technique, based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, is used to generate a self-consistent description of thermally-excited states of a dilute boson gas. EOS The process of evaporative cooling is then modelled by following the time evolution of the system using the same equation.	It is shown that the subsequent rethermalisation of the thermally-excited state produces a cooler coherent condensate.

doc	UAV Swarms as Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relays EOS Unmanned aerial vehicles provide new opportunities for performance improvements in future wireless communications systems. EOS For example, they can act as relays that extend the range of a communication link and improve the capacity. EOS Unlike conventional relays that are deployed at fixed locations, UAVs can change their positions to optimize the capacity or range on demand. EOS In this paper, we consider using a swarm of UAVs as amplify-and-forward MIMO relays to provide connectivity between an obstructed multi-antenna equipped source and destination. EOS We start by optimizing UAV placement for the single antenna case, and analyze its dependence on the noise introduced by the relay, its gain, and transmit power constraint.	We extend our analysis for an arbitrary UAV swarm and show how the MIMO link capacity can be optimized by changing the distance of the swarm to the source and the destination.

doc	Breaking the Ice: Planetesimal Formation at the Snowline EOS Recently Saito & Sirono (2011) proposed that large ice aggregates which drift in- wards in protoplanetary disks break up during sublimation, ejecting embedded silicate particles. EOS This would lead to a concentration of small solid particles close to the snow- line.	In view of this model we carried out laboratory experiments where we observed freely levitating ice aggregates sublimating.
doc	Influence of post-deposition annealing on the chemical states of crystalline tantalum pentoxide films EOS We investigate the effect of post-deposition annealing (for temperatures from 848 K to 1273 K) on the chemical properties of crystalline Ta _EQN_ O _EQN_ films grown on Si(100) substrates by radio frequency magnetron sputtering. EOS The atomic arrangement, as determined by X-ray diffraction, is predominately hexagonal (_EQN_ -Ta _EQN_ O _EQN_) for the films exposed to heat treatments at 948 K and 1048 K; EOS orthorhombic (_EQN_ -Ta _EQN_ O _EQN_) for samples annealed at 1148 K and 1273 K; EOS and amorphous for samples annealed at temperatures below 948 K. EOS X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for Ta _EQN_ and O _EQN_ core-levels were performed to evaluate the chemical properties of all films as a function of annealing temperature. EOS Upon analysis, it is observed the Ta _EQN_ spectrum characteristic of Ta in Ta _EQN_ and the formation of Ta-oxide phases with oxidation states Ta _EQN_, Ta _EQN_, Ta _EQN_, and Ta _EQN_. EOS The study reveals that the increase in annealing temperature increases the percentage of the state Ta _EQN_ and the reduction of the others indicating that higher temperatures are more desirable to produce Ta _EQN_ O _EQN_, however, there seems to be an optimal annealing temperature that maximizes the O\% to Ta\% ratio.	We found that at 1273 K the ratio slightly reduces suggesting oxygen depletion.
doc	Lorentz and CPT violations from Chern-Simons modifications of QED EOS The possibility of a small modification of spinor Quantum Electro-Dynamics is reconsidered, in which Lorentz and CPT non-covariant kinetic terms for photons and fermions are present. EOS The corresponding free field theory is carefully discussed.	The finite one-loop parity-odd induced effective action is unambiguously calculated using the physical cutoff method, which manifestly encodes the maximal residual symmetry group allowed by the presence of the Lorentz and CPT breaking axial-vector.

doc	Recursive tree processes and the mean-field limit of stochastic flows EOS Interacting particle systems can often be constructed from a graphical representation, by applying local maps at the times of associated Poisson processes. EOS This leads to a natural coupling of systems started in different initial states. EOS We consider interacting particle systems on the complete graph in the mean-field limit, i.e., as the number of vertices tends to infinity.	We are not only interested in the mean-field limit of a single process, but mainly in how several coupled processes behave in the limit.

doc	Two-Body Assignment Problem in the Context of the Israeli Medical Internship Match EOS This thesis was submitted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Masters Degree in the Department of Computer Science, Bar-Ilan University. EOS The final step in getting an Israeli M.D. EOS is performing a year-long internship in one of the hospitals in Israel. EOS Internships are decided upon by a lottery, which is known as "The Internship Lottery". EOS In 2014 we redesigned the lottery, replacing it with a more efficient one. EOS The new method is based on calculating a tentative lottery, in which each student has some probability of getting to each hospital. EOS Then a computer program "trades" between the students, where trade is performed only if it is beneficial to both sides. EOS This trade creates surplus, which translates to more students getting one of their top choices. EOS The average student improved his place by _EQN_ seats. EOS The new method can improve the welfare of medical graduates, by giving them more probability to get to one of their top choices. EOS It can be applied in internship markets in other countries as well. EOS This thesis presents the market, the redesign process and the new mechanism which is now in use. EOS There are two main lessons that we have learned from this market. EOS The first is the "Do No Harm" principle, which states that (almost) all participants should prefer the new mechanism to the old one. EOS The second is that new approaches need to be used when dealing with two-body problems in object assignment. EOS We focus on the second lesson, and study two-body problems in the context of the assignment problem.	We show that decomposing stochastic assignment matrices to deterministic allocations is NP-hard in the presence of couples, and present a polynomial time algorithm with the optimal worst case guarantee.
doc	Effects of rotation on the evolution of primordial stars EOS (Abridged) Rotation has been shown to play a determinant role at very low metallicity, bringing heavy mass loss where almost none was expected. EOS Is this still true when the metallicity strictly equals zero? EOS The aim of our study is to get an answer to this question, and to determine how rotation changes the evolution and the chemical signature of the primordial stars.	We have calculated 14 differentially-rotating and non-rotating stellar models at zero metallicity, with masses between 9 and 200 Msol.
doc	Neutrino Flavor Mixing Constrained by Accelerator and Reactor Experiments and Solar Neutrino Observation EOS We derive the constraints imposed on neutrino masses and mixing angles by performing a combined analysis of the data from the Los Alamos and the other terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments with the assumption of the flavor-mixing solutions to the solar neutrino problem. EOS In a three-flavor mixing scheme which ignores the possibility of sterile neutrinos, we obtain severe constraints on the pattern of masses and flavor mixing of neutrinos.	For example, we show that in the standard Kobayashi-Maskawa type mixing matrix _EQN_ independent of the choice of the solar neutrino solutions.
doc	Enhancing Deep Neural Networks Against Adversarial Malware Examples EOS Machine learning based malware detection is known to be vulnerable to adversarial evasion attacks. EOS The state-of-the-art is that there are no effective countermeasures against these attacks. EOS Inspired by the AICS'2019 Challenge organized by the MIT Lincoln Lab, we systematize a number of principles for enhancing the robustness of neural networks against adversarial malware evasion attacks. EOS Some of these principles have been scattered in the literature, but others are proposed in this paper for the first time. EOS Under the guidance of these principles, we propose a framework for defending against adversarial malware evasion attacks. EOS We validated the framework using the Drebin dataset of Android malware. EOS We applied the defense framework to the AICS'2019 Challenge and won, without knowing how the organizers generated the adversarial examples. EOS However, we see a ~22\% difference between the accuracy in the experiment with the Drebin dataset (for binary classification) and the accuracy in the experiment with respect to the AICS'2019 Challenge (for multiclass classification).	We attribute this gap to a fundamental barrier that without knowing the attacker's manipulation set, the defender cannot do effective Adversarial Training.

doc	Radio detections of southern ultracool dwarfs EOS We report the results of a volume-limited survey using the Australia Telescope Compact Array to search for transient and quiescent radio emission from 15 southern hemisphere ultracool dwarfs. EOS We detect radio emission from 2MASSW J0004348-404405 increasing the number of radio loud ultracool dwarfs to 22. EOS We also observe radio emission from 2MASS J10481463-3956062 and 2MASSI J0339352-352544, two sources with previous radio detections. EOS The radio emission from the three detected sources shows no variability or flare emission. EOS Modelling this quiescent emission we find that it is consistent with optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission from a magnetosphere with an emitting region radius of (1 - 2) _EQN_, magnetic field inclination 20 _EQN_ - 80 _EQN_, field strength _EQN_ 10 - 200 G, and power-law electron density _EQN_ 10 _EQN_ - 10 _EQN_ cm _EQN_. EOS Additionally, we place upper limits on four ultracool dwarfs with no previous radio observations. EOS This increases the number of ultracool dwarfs studied at radio frequencies to 222. EOS Analysing general trends of the radio emission for this sample of 15 sources, we find that the radio activity increases for later spectral types and more rapidly rotating objects.	Furthermore, comparing the ratio of the radio to X-ray luminosities for these sources, we find 2MASS J10481463-3956062 and 2MASSI J0339352-352544 violate the Guedel-Benz relation by more than two orders of magnitude.

doc	Cosmological predictions from the Misner brane EOS Within the spirit of five-dimensional gravity in the Randall-Sundrum scenario, in this paper we consider cosmological and gravitational implications induced by forcing the spacetime metric to satisfy a Misner-like symmetry. EOS We first show that in the resulting Misner-brane framework the Friedmann metric for a radiation dominated flat universe and the Schwarzschild or anti-de Sitter black holes metrics are exact solutions on the branes, but the model cannot accommodate any inflationary solution. EOS The horizon and flatness problems can however be solved in Misner-brane cosmology by causal and noncausal communications through the extra dimension between distant regions which are outside the horizon.	Based on a semiclassical approximation to the path-integral approach, we have calculated the quantum state of the Misner-brane universe and the quantum perturbations induced on its metric by brane propagation along the fifth direction.
doc	On cherry and pitchfork distributions of random rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees EOS Tree shape statistics are important for investigating evolutionary mechanisms mediating phylogenetic trees. EOS As a step towards bridging shape statistics between rooted and unrooted trees, we present a comparison study on two subtree statistics known as numbers of cherries and pitchforks for the proportional to distinguishable arrangements (PDA) and the Yule-Harding-Kingman (YHK) models. EOS Based on recursive formulas on the joint distribution of the number of cherries and that of pitchforks, it is shown that cherry distributions are log-concave for both rooted and unrooted trees under these two models. EOS Furthermore, the mean number of cherries and that of pitchforks for unrooted trees converge respectively to those for rooted trees under the YHK model while there exists a limiting gap of 1/4 for the PDA model.	Finally, the total variation distances between the cherry distributions of rooted and those of unrooted trees converge for both models.
doc	Finding Exogenous Variables in Data with Many More Variables than Observations EOS Many statistical methods have been proposed to estimate causal models in classical situations with fewer variables than observations (p<n, p: the number of variables and n: the number of observations). EOS However, modern datasets including gene expression data need high-dimensional causal modeling in challenging situations with orders of magnitude more variables than observations (p>>n). EOS In this paper, we propose a method to find exogenous variables in a linear non-Gaussian causal model, which requires much smaller sample sizes than conventional methods and works even when p>>n. EOS The key idea is to identify which variables are exogenous based on non-Gaussianity instead of estimating the entire structure of the model.	Exogenous variables work as triggers that activate a causal chain in the model, and their identification leads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the causal mechanism.
doc	Mining Frequent Itemsets from Secondary Memory EOS Mining frequent itemsets is at the core of mining association rules, and is by now quite well understood algorithmically.	However, most algorithms for mining frequent itemsets assume that the main memory is large enough for the data structures used in the mining, and very few efficient algorithms deal with the case when the database is very large or the minimum support is very low.
doc	SU(3) gauge theory with 12 flavours in a twisted box EOS We present preliminary result for the step-scaling study of the coupling constant with the Yang-Mills gradient flow, in the twelve-favour SU(3) gauge theory. EOS In this work, the lattice simulation is performed using unimproved staggered fermions and the Wilson plaquette gauge action, from which the gradient flow is also implemented. EOS Imposing twisted boundary condition a'la t'Hooft and Parisi, our calculation is performed at zero fermion mass. EOS The renormalised coupling constant is extracted via the computation of the energy density.	In order to examine the reliability of the continuum extrapolation, we investigate this coupling constant using two different lattice discretisations.
doc	Asymptotic symmetries and subleading soft graviton theorem in higher dimensions EOS We investigate the relation between the subleading soft graviton theorem and asymptotic symmetries in gravity in even dimensions higher than four. EOS After rewriting the subleading soft graviton theorem as a Ward identity, we argue that the charges of such identity generate Diff _EQN_.	In order to show that, we propose suitable commutation relation among certain components of the metric fields.

EOS Recent work shows that Abell 2152 is actually the projection of two different clusters, one of which is a Hercules supercluster member at z=0.043, while the other is more than 3 times as distant. EOS The cluster centers have a projected separation of only 2.4 arcmin, and our data indicate that the foreground cluster lenses members of the background one.	We have an ongoing program to measure the magnification of the fundamental plane in the background cluster.

doc	Radiative Properties and Excitons of Candidate Defect Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride EOS Point defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have attracted growing attention as bright single-photon emitters. EOS However, understanding of their atomic structure and radiative properties remains incomplete. EOS Here we employ first-principles calculations to compute the structure, excited states and radiative lifetimes of over 20 native defects and carbon or oxygen impurities in hBN, generating a large data set of light emission energy, polarization and lifetime.	Bayesian analysis of our results combined with existing experimental data allows us to identify the native _EQN_ defect as the most likely single-photon emitter in hBN.
doc	An Axion-Like Particle from an _EQN_ Seesaw with _EQN_ EOS We investigate the decoupling of heavy right handed neutrinos in the context of an SO(10) GUT model, where a remnant anomalous symmetry is _EQN_. EOS In this model the see-saw mechanism which generates the neutrino masses is intertwined with the Stueckelberg mechanism, which leaves the CP-odd phase of a very heavy Higgs in the low energy spectrum as an axion-like particle. EOS Such pseudoscalar is predicted to be ultralight, in the _EQN_ eV mass range.	In this scenario, the remnant anomalous _EQN_ symmetry of the particles of the Standard Model is interpreted as due to the incomplete decoupling of the right handed neutrino sector.
doc	Prevalence of Tidal Interactions among Local Seyfert Galaxies: The Control Experiment EOS We test whether there is a relation between the observed tidal interactions and Seyfert activity by imaging in HI twenty inactive galaxies at the same spatial resolution and detection threshold as the Seyfert sample.	This control sample of inactive galaxies were closely matched in Hubble type, range in size and inclination, and have roughly comparable galaxy optical luminosity to the Seyfert galaxies.
doc	Application of XFaster power spectrum and likelihood estimator to Planck EOS We develop the XFaster Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy power spectrum and likelihood technique for the Planck CMB satellite mission. EOS We give an overview of this estimator and its current implementation and present the results of applying this algorithm to simulated Planck data. EOS We show that it can accurately extract the power spectrum of Planck data for the high-l multipoles range. EOS We compare the XFaster approximation for the likelihood to other high-l likelihood approximations such as Gaussian and Offset Lognormal and a low-l pixel-based likelihood.	We show that the XFaster likelihood is not only accurate at high-l, but also performs well at moderately low multipoles.
doc	Modification of special relativity and formulation of convergent and invariant quantum field theory EOS Besides the two fundamental postulates, (i) the principle of relativity and (ii) the constancy of the one-way velocity of light in all inertial frames of reference, the special theory of relativity employs another assumption. EOS This assumption concerns the flat structures of gravity-free space and time in the usual inertial coordinate system. EOS We introduce the primed inertial coordinate system, in addition to the usual inertial coordinate system, for each inertial frame of reference, and assume the flat structures of gravity-free space and time in the primed inertial coordinate system and their generalized Finslerian structures in the usual inertial coordinate system. EOS Combining this alternative assumption with (i) and (ii), we modify the special theory of relativity. EOS The modified theory involves two versions of the light speed, infinite speed c' in the primed inertial coordinate system and finite speed c in the usual inertial coordinate system. EOS It involves the c'-type Galilean transformation between two primed inertial coordinate systems and the localized Lorentz transformation between two corresponding usual inertial coordinate systems. EOS It also involves a new physical principle.	This principle is applied to reform of mechanics, field theory and quantum field theory.
doc	Absolutely Self Pure Modules EOS An _EQN_ -module _EQN_ is called absolutely self pure if for any finitely generated left ideal of _EQN_ whose kernel is in the filter generated by the set of all left ideals _EQN_ of _EQN_ with _EQN_ ann _EQN_ for some _EQN_, any map from _EQN_ to _EQN_ is a restriction of a map _EQN_. EOS Certain properties of quasi injective and absolutely pure modules are extended to absolute self purity.	Regular and left noetherian rings are characterized using this new concept.
doc	Is Blockchain Hashing an Effective Method for Electronic Governance? EOS Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for the delivery of their public services. EOS Blockchain hashing - or the insertion of data in the blockchain - is one of the potential applications of the blockchain in this space. EOS With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity. EOS Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on central governmental databases. EOS The paper starts by analysing possible scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. EOS Second, the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain.	Third, it also addresses issues related to concepts such as distributed ledger technology and permissioned blockchains.

doc	Inference of modes for linear stochastic processes EOS For dynamical systems that can be modelled as asymptotically stable linear systems forced by Gaussian noise, this paper develops methods to infer or estimate their modes from observations in real time. EOS The modes can be real or complex. EOS For a real mode, we wish to infer its damping rate and mode shape. EOS For a complex mode, we wish to infer its frequency, damping rate and (complex) mode shape. EOS Their amplitudes and correlations are encoded in a mode covariance matrix.	The work is motivated and illustrated by the problem of detection of oscillations in power flow in AC electrical networks.
doc	Parity Violation in Aharonov-Bohm Systems: The Spontaneous Hall Effect EOS We show how macroscopic manifestations of _EQN_ (and _EQN_) symmetry breaking can arise in a simple system subject to Aharonov-Bohm interactions. EOS Specifically, we study the conductivity of a gas of charged particles moving through a dilute array of flux tubes. EOS The interaction of the electrons with the flux tubes is taken to be of a purely Aharonov-Bohm type.	We find that the system exhibits a non-zero transverse conductivity, i.e., a spontaneous Hall effect.
doc	Separating timing, movement conditions and individual differences in the analysis of human movement EOS A central task in the analysis of human movement behavior is to determine systematic patterns and differences across experimental conditions, participants and repetitions. EOS This is possible because human movement is highly regular, being constrained by invariance principles. EOS Movement timing and movement path, in particular, are linked through scaling laws. EOS Separating variations of movement timing from the spatial variations of movements is a well-known challenge that is addressed in current approaches only through forms of preprocessing that bias analysis. EOS Here we propose a novel nonlinear mixed-effects model for analyzing temporally continuous signals that contain systematic effects in both timing and path.	Identifiability issues of path relative to timing are overcome by using maximum likelihood estimation in which the most likely separation of space and time is chosen given the variation found in data.
doc	Lazy Transformation-Based Learning EOS We introduce a significant improvement for a relatively new machine learning method called Transformation-Based Learning. EOS By applying a Monte Carlo strategy to randomly sample from the space of rules, rather than exhaustively analyzing all possible rules, we drastically reduce the memory and time costs of the algorithm, without compromising accuracy on unseen data.	This enables Transformation- Based Learning to apply to a wider range of domains, as it can effectively consider a larger number of different features and feature interactions in the data.
doc	Room temperature compressibility and diffusivity of liquid water from first principles EOS The isothermal compressibility of water is essential to understand its anomalous properties. EOS We compute it by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of 200 molecules at five densities, using two different van der Waals density functionals. EOS While both functionals predict compressibilities within ~30% of experiment, only one of them accurately reproduces, within the uncertainty of the simulation, the density dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient in the anomalous region.	The discrepancies between the two functionals are explained in terms of the low- and high-density structures of the liquid.
doc	Mitigation of the instrumental noise transient in gravitational-wave data surrounding GW170817 EOS In the coming years gravitational-wave detectors will undergo a series of improvements, with an increase in their detection rate by about an order of magnitude. EOS Routine detections of gravitational-wave signals promote novel astrophysical and fundamental theory studies, while simultaneously leading to an increase in the number of detections temporally overlapping with instrumentally- or environmentally-induced transients in the detectors (glitches), often of unknown origin. EOS Indeed, this was the case for the very first detection by the LIGO and Virgo detectors of a gravitational-wave signal consistent with a binary neutron star coalescence, GW170817.	A loud glitch in the LIGO-Livingston detector, about one second before the merger, hampered coincident detection (which was initially achieved solely with LIGO-Hanford data).
